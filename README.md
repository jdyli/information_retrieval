While conventional information retrieval methods focus mostly on retrieving documents or images that are relevant to a query, tables also often contain valuable information in a structured way. Last year, Zhang et Balog published a paper where they proposed several new table retrieval methods which were considerably more accurate than a state-of-the-art baseline. This Github repositoy contains the code that accompanies the paper in which we reproduce all lexical baseline methods and the semantic word embedding method.
