They convince him to believe that Doug must have given him the wrong address in order to avoid him. Eventually, Pete tries to commit suicide, but is saved by Wayne and Dahlia, who feel guilty as they believe they drove him to the suicide attempt. Pete finally discovers Wayne's con when he goes back to the Riches' house again, and, finding no one home, speaks with their neighbor Jim Burns. The Malloys try to escape from Pete before the law comes down on them by drugging Pete and taking off, but Dale, who has been trying to elbow into Wayne's con, sabotages their RV and murders Pete to keep the con alive. Pete, like Doug, has very few friends who would come looking for him, but he has as mother who hires a private investigator to go looking for Pete when he appears missing."

Both Aya that Junpei come major awards: the first win a major literary prize and is contacted by a major publishing house, that recommends her at a prestigious university, the second is contacted by the director who won the summer festival years ago, impressed from his latest film. The two guys, however, are experiencing a period of creative crisis, and only mutual consolation helps them to find inspiration.

Dale was a former rival for Dahlia's affections, ultimately losing out to Wayne. He has shown flashes of sociopathic behavior from early childhood, culminating in him murdering his father to usurp leadership of the clan. After torturing Ken to exact information on the Malloy's location, Dale travels to Edenfalls and works his way into the Malloy's con first by initiating a sexual relationship with Hartley Underwood, and then by blackmailing Wayne into letting him on as a partner in his con and giving him a job as a mail-boy at PANCO."

When Wayne was stealing the family bank from a safe in Earl's room, Earl could have sounded the alarm by ringing a bell, but apparently chose not to; it was later indicated that he preferred Wayne as the next clan head. He seems to have been a good leader, winning the love, respect and admiration of both Dale and Wayne. Earl was eventually murdered by Dale, who feared losing his power within the clan."

Although she is pregnant she continually drinks. Dale approved of her match without the knowledge of Wayne or Dahlia. Ginny and Dale are increasingly at odds, with Ginny attempting to undermine Dale's aims to become the new clan boss. In the second season, she is seen with a child having given birth though the child's sex is a mystery. It is heavily implied that her father and uncle were murdered by Eamon Quinn."

He has a history of bad blood with Wayne and the Malloy family prior to his incarceration that is implied to have involved betrayals and at least several murders.

Dahlia is considered 'royalty' in their Traveller clan, and her connection to the clan (both by blood and ideology) appears to be much stronger than Wayne's. She was initially very skeptical of Wayne's plan to leave their old lifestyle and impersonate the Riches, but has helped him work the con and done her part to assume the identity of Cherien Rich. Out of guilt over her current lifestyle, Dahlia has recently turned herself in for parole violation."

In addition to his artistic endeavors, he also speaks French. Sam quickly falls in love with Rosemere Academy, where he seems to have found a place for himself, despite his being very shy and socially uncomfortable. Sam's cross-dressing helps him feel more comfortable with himself; when he is not acting in a con, his shyness is worst when he is not allowed to cross-dress."

Wayne meets Hugh while golfing with Jim Burns, making a wager over the golf game and losing to Wayne. Wayne wins a job-offer from a law-firm, but after Hugh tells Wayne he will have supervisors breathing down his neck at a law firm, Hugh convinces Wayne to work as inhouse-counsel for Panco instead. Hugh has been married multiple times, most recently to a stripper, GiGi, from Las Vegas during Season 2. A recovered drug addict, Hugh is inveigled to relapse by Dahlia's fellow ex-con Chunky Kay. Wayne's constant work to keep Hugh and Panco afloat and ingratiate himself into a position as a Panco partner lead Hugh to consider Wayne, or as he thinks, Doug, as his closest and only real friend. Towards the end of Season 2, Hugh decides to run for Mayor of Ducaine."

However, because the gas in the system is also for use during the dive itself it requires that the diver pays extra attention to gas management to ensure that an adequate amount of reserve is available for any bailout requirement at any phase of the dive.
