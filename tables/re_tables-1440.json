Jack's crime is that he hasn't made a pass at Chrissy, and she's afraid she's losing her sex appeal. With Janet as intermediary Jack explains that he's a one-woman man, and right now he's got a girlfriend, otherwise he would certainly have attacked her."

        "Jack learns that Mr. Roper has agreed by phone to sell his 20 year old car to a used car dealer. Jack convinces Janet and Chrissy that they should buy it, since Roper is selling it so cheap. Although Mrs. Roper chides Stanley about going back on his word to the dealer, Wagstaff, Roper takes the trio's offer of slightly more cash. The car leads to nothing but trouble for the trio, who can't work out a system of sharing the car, and then it turns out that the car will cost them more than they paid for it just to make it roadworthy. Meanwhile, Wagstaff tells Roper that the car is a classic, and offers him $1200 for it. Roper cons the kids into selling the car back to him for what they paid, but he still loses out, because it turns out that the car is not what Roper thought it was, and Wagstaff rescinds his offer.",

He thoroughly charms Chrissy and Janet, but Jack warns them not to be too charmed because Fremont Tripper has a habit of buying gifts for people with bad checks. No sooner does he reveal this problem then Roper shows up demanding the rent, and Fremont cavalierly dashes off a check for $100.00. The trio then tries to retrieve the check by sneaking into the Ropers' apartment while Roper is asleep on the couch but Jack gets caught in the act. Meanwhile, Fremont is telling Mrs. Roper about his talent for investing, and Mrs. Roper convinces Stanley he should invest too; all he needs is $100.00 to buy into Fremont's latest scheme. Roper gives Fremont the check. Since Jack is still mad, Fremont decides to leave, but when his wealthy lady friend arrives with an offer to give him marriage and security, he opts for his freedom.",

Hearing Gwen\u2019s cry for help, Ian rescues her from a marsh mire, but he does not reveal the magic jewel he has recently found and which has actually enabled him to transform from a wolfman beast to a human. Now that he has met Gwen, he is worried that if he gives the jewel away, he will remain a beast forever and lose her love. Ian must decide what to do because Lady Kale has offered him the chance to remain human forever if he gives her the magic jewel.

The first attempt was thwarted by gale force winds on 14 September of that year which brought the predominantly iron structure to the ground with a thundering crash that could be heard for miles around. Fortunately no one was working there at the time and so there were no casualties. The second attempt was completed by 1918 by which time its original purpose for cotton had become a lower priority to World War I and it was initially used as a factory for assembling aircraft components. Finally, it became used for spinning cotton in the following year. Lilac, along with Park Mill was the last mill in Shaw and Crompton to spin cotton in 1989. Currently part of JD Williams Co Ltd National Distribution Centre, it has been adapted for offices and warehousing, linking in 2000 on two levels to the company's new highbay automated warehouse. The building is currently run by Fulfillment Logistics as a warehouse for the JD Williams catalogue order operation. It's linked by a bridge to Briar mill.",
