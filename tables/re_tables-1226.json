        "It's time for the Annual Woodland Valley Storytelling Festival at the Big Blue House and viewers are invited to come and listen in! As everyone gets ready for the story, Bear prepares the food and other accommodations, while also stopping to help his friends in the Big Blue House. Tutter's found a great beginning and ending for his story, but it's seriously lacking a middle. Bear also helps Treelo and Ojo with an idea for telling a story in pictures.

For some reason, though, everyone seems to be talking about the potty and the bathroom. It all starts when Tutter needs to use the potty, but doesn't want to leave the checkers game. Bear assures him it will still be waiting for him. Later, Ojo has an accident and is very embarrassed, but Bear lets her know it's okay; accidents can happen to anyone. When Pip and Pop hear about the day's events, they invite everyone to join their secret club; The Mystic Order of the Toileteers. It's for everyone who uses, or is going to use the potty.

Tutter is excited about the trip at first and eagerly tells the kids at the Big Blue House about it when he gets there. When he tells them that Miss Maxwell said the location would be a surprise, Pip and Pop figure that the trip must be to a field. The kids think about all of the fun things they could do on a trip around the world. Tutter, however, becomes very worried that he's going to be stranded in the middle of nowhere. He hides his permission slip from Bear and later decides to fake being sick. Meanwhile, Ojo plans a big trip on her bike. She plots out her course, but finds that sometimes you need a guide, such as a responsible adult, to help out.

        "When Bear receives a package from \"L.L. Bear\" in the mail, he's surprised to find that he received a skunk clock rather than the bear clock he ordered. Rather than returning it, he decides to give it a try and hangs it up in the kitchen. He hears Ojo and Treelo outside and finds Treelo swinging on a swing. He gets off and asks Ojo to try, but finds that she doesn't want to. She admits to being somewhat scared, but finds a compromise in starting out by first taking small swings. As Bear heads off into the living room for a nap, Tutter is disturbed by the \"tick-tock\" of the skunk clock, mistaking it for a real skunk. He's scared by it, but eventually comes to realize that it's actually alive and is nothing to be afraid of. Out at the Otter Pond, Pip and Pop play a game called \"Double D Dare.\" When their daring starts to get dangerous, Bear suggests that they think of things to do that are silly, but not potentially dangerous. Sometimes, if you're scared to do something, there may be a very good reason for it.",

They're pretending to be Big Blue House detectives, but they feel that they've solved all the mysteries in the Big Blue House, or perhaps even the world. Bear gives them a new challenge by using dishtowels to blindfold them so that they can play one of his favorite games: \"What is It?\" Using senses other than sight, he first has them identify a flower and then peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. Later, they find an actual mystery to solve when Treelo reports that his \"banananana\" is missing. With Bear's help, the senses of touch and smell are used to track down the stinky, squishy old banana. When the cookies are finally finished, the kids decide to cover up all their senses except taste in an attempt to get Bear to give them some cookies. He quickly ends the game; he was planning to share the cookies with them anyway. They all end up sharing the cookies together outside, as Pip and Pop express their appreciation for all the wonderful sounds, sights and smells of nature. In the Shadow segment, Shadow retells the story of Little Red Riding Hood. In her twist on the story, the Granny is a doctor.",

However, when he opens the package, he finds that the book is called 1001 Ways to Cook Slop. This definitely isn't the book he ordered. A quick phone call to Jeremiah Tortoise reveals the mixup; Bear might have received Doc Hog's cookbook by mistake, while Doc Hog got the book intended for Bear. He says that he'll get the problem taken care of as fast as he can. This leaves Bear with a bit of a dilemma (and also drama), as he still needs a book to read for his club, but it could take a while for Jeremiah to bring the right book.

He's created his very own Club Tutter in the kitchen, using the sink as a swimming pool."

InuYasha partially tears off Sesshomaru's new arm and reclaims Tetsusaiga, which regains its powers. Sesshomaru flees to remove the rest of the arm, which is turning against him. When Naraku explains that he added something to allow him to retrieve his jewel shard, Sesshomaru decides to kill Naraku. Fearing for Kagome's safety, InuYasha takes away her jewel shard and throws her down the bone-eater's well, trapping her in modern times by blockading it. InuYasha fights off the hell-wolf Royakan, to whom Naraku then gives a jewel shard and a plant that will kill Royakan unless he kills InuYasha."

        "Sesshomaru resurrects Jaken with Tenseiga. Controlled by the sword Tokijin, Kaijinbo attacks InuYasha during the night of the new moon; the rest of the group tries to fight him off while InuYasha remains in his vulnerable full-human form. Tokijin cuts Sango's boomarang in half; even when Miroku splits Kaijinbo's head open, his body keeps fighting. Toto-sai brings the reforged Tetsusaiga, but InuYasha cannot use the sword at full strength-- in human form, he cannot tap into its demonic powers, and when his half-demon shape returns, the sword becomes almost too heavy to lift. When Tetsusaiga and Tokijin clash, Kaijinbo's body disintegrates under the strain. Toto-sai says the extra weight is from InuYasha's fang and he must build up his strength. Sesshomaru claims Tokijin, easily overcoming its evil aura, then knocks Tetsusaiga out of InuYasha's hands to test his brother's transformation. InuYasha involuntarily returns to berserker full-demon mode again; Toto-sai breathes fire as cover to let the rest of the group drag InuYasha away. Toto-sai repairs Sango's boomerang. The group persuades InuYasha to never part with Tetsusaiga again, though without telling him that it suppresses his full-demon transformation. Yearning for freedom, Kagura asks Sesshomaru to kill Naraku, who now creates two new detachments: Juromaru and Kageromaru. Although partially bound, Juromaru fights and pursues Koga. As their path intersects InuYasha's group, Naraku unshackles Juromaru's muzzle and chains. Juromaru destroys Naraku's surrogate demon puppet and fights InuYasha. Kageromaru emerges from Juromaru's gut to join the fight, moving almost too quickly to see, and eats some of InuYasha's innards. Koga rejoins the fight to protect Kagome, taking on Kageromaru while InuYasha focuses on Juromaru. InuYasha passes out but awakes when Kageromaru threatens to eat Kagome.",

Toto-sai brings the reforged Tetsusaiga, but InuYasha cannot use the sword at full strength-- in human form, he cannot tap into its demonic powers, and when his half-demon shape returns, the sword becomes almost too heavy to lift. When Tetsusaiga and Tokijin clash, Kaijinbo's body disintegrates under the strain. Toto-sai says the extra weight is from InuYasha's fang and he must build up his strength. Sesshomaru claims Tokijin, easily overcoming its evil aura, then knocks Tetsusaiga out of InuYasha's hands to test his brother's transformation. InuYasha involuntarily returns to berserker full-demon mode again; Toto-sai breathes fire as cover to let the rest of the group drag InuYasha away. Toto-sai repairs Sango's boomerang. The group persuades InuYasha to never part with Tetsusaiga again, though without telling him that it suppresses his full-demon transformation. Yearning for freedom, Kagura asks Sesshomaru to kill Naraku, who now creates two new detachments: Juromaru and Kageromaru. Although partially bound, Juromaru fights and pursues Koga. As their path intersects InuYasha's group, Naraku unshackles Juromaru's muzzle and chains. Juromaru destroys Naraku's surrogate demon puppet and fights InuYasha. Kageromaru emerges from Juromaru's gut to join the fight, moving almost too quickly to see, and eats some of InuYasha's innards. Koga rejoins the fight to protect Kagome, taking on Kageromaru while InuYasha focuses on Juromaru. InuYasha passes out but awakes when Kageromaru threatens to eat Kagome.",

Kageromaru emerges and disappears back into Juromaru's gut. InuYasha unleashes the Wind Scar to destroy both detachments. Nearly hit by the Wind Scar himself, Koga argues with InuYasha until Kagome ends it with a \"sit\"; after Koga departs, InuYasha jealously argues with Kagome and she goes home.

The audition begins with an obstacle course, with the idols first required to climb a steep wall which is made more difficult due to Naoto spraying water everywhere, eliminating the contestants down to fifty. They next have to cross a balance beam whilst being bombarded with volleyballs, followed by having to finish a song whilst riding a mechanical bull, reducing the contestants to twenty.

He suggests that they think of it as their \"home away from home.\" They decide to play a game called \"parmcheesy\" and Ojo's worried because it sounds like a game only for mice, but Tutter assures her it wouldn't be a party without her.

Surprise Party toured across North America (United States and Canada) and was based on the episode \"Mouse Party.\" It's Tutter's birthday and viewers are invited to join Bear and the kids in the Big Blue House as they work together to plan a surprise party for Tutter. This stage production features many of the voices from the show and many of its songs as well, such as \"The Bear Cha-Cha-Cha,\" \"Baby, Baby\" and \"Otter Love.\" On his birthday, Tutter finds himself missing his friends, not knowing that they're in the process of planning an elaborate surprise party. While he laments being all alone, the preparations are in full-swing. Ojo gets to work on making the cake, Pip and Pop are placed in charge of the decorations and Treelo is given the task of wrapping Tutter's present. Pip and Pop get literally wrapped up in the decorations, but Bear helps them to break free. And Treelo finds himself wanting a present, but Bear helps him to see that even when it's not your birthday, there's a lot of fun to be had at a birthday party. The VHS / DVD recording features cuts at appropriate times for audience reactions. Additionally, a couple of lucky kids with birthdays get to come on-stage for a special presentation of \"Happy, Happy Birthday.\" The Shadow segment, recycled from \"Bear's Birthday Bash\" features the children of the week.",

        "An orphaned girl, Satsuki, hopes that her \"Shikon shard\" will bring her older brother back from the wars. Shippo brings her to the house of the village headman, where the group is staying after Miroku exorcized a lizard demon there. Kagome and Sango look at Satsuki's shard and tell Shippo that it is just a \"stone flower\", a quartz crystal. Shippo tries to steal a real jewel shard for Satsuki, but InuYasha stops him. The lizard demon returns, disguised as Satsuki's brother, and takes her hostage. Shippo helps her escape, while InuYasha and Miroku kill the demon and then credit Shippo for it. Rather than remaining in her family's empty hut, Satsuki finally agrees to let the headman's family adopt her. Koga's and InuYasha's two groups both catch Naraku's scent from a different castle. As Koga runs ahead, Kagura decides to attack him and cuts the jewel shards out of his legs. InuYasha's group arrives before she can kill Koga, so she takes his shards and flees. As both groups pursue her, Kagura finds Sesshomaru and offers him her shards if he will kill Naraku. When he refuses, she calls him a coward and tries to fight her pursuers. She drops the shards when Koga hits her, but she notices that InuYasha is transforming from human to half-demon, exposing his weakness on the night of the new moon. She attacks InuYasha with the dance of the dragon and he counters with his wind scar, now strong enough to work against her wind magic. Naraku's demons sacrifice themselves to let Kagura escape; when she returns to the castle, Naraku (who was secretly reorganizing his body) threatens to reabsorb her if she keeps displaying her own initiative. Koga returns the shards to his legs and flees before InuYasha can take them. A beautiful princess is bewitching men from their village into a mountain and stealing their youth. Miroku and Sango go to investigate, but a spiritual barrier separates them. The \"princess\" tries to seduce Miroku, but Sango interrupts and exposes the true form of a dog-demon which Miroku exorcises. Sango kills the dog-demon and Miroku comforts the freed princess, a long-dead spirit who now ascends to heaven. The villagers regain their youth and return home. Miroku lets Sango know that he thinks she is special, making her blush in confusion until he pats her rump. She slaps him. Bandits find a large, random lump of flesh and stab it. A new detachment of Naraku emerges as a naked faceless figure that kills the men, rips their faces off, and tries them on while checking its reflection in the river. A monk named Muso tries to exorcise the demon, but it kills him and decides to keep his face and name. A woman tells InuYasha's group what happened. When they finds a burning village full of dead bodies. Muso (the demon) says that he enjoyed killing them. InuYasha is surprised that Muso knows nothing of Naraku or InuYasha, while Naraku watches this in Kanna's mirror.",

        "When InuYasha cuts off Muso's arm, saimyosho fuse into a new arm for him. Muso calls Kagome \"Kikyo\" before InuYasha seems to destroy him with the wind-scar. The group realizes that Muso is Onigumo, Naraku's original human core. Naraku releases Kagura from her chains and sends her after Muso. Guided to Onigumo's cave by the saimyosho, Muso recovers Onigumo's memories. Kagura tells InuYasha's group where Muso is, and they prevent him from killing Kaede. Muso tells them Onigumo didn't want Naraku to kill Kikyo. After fighting Muso for a while, InuYasha aims at his spider mark, but Kagura pulls Muso away to Naraku, who forcibly reabsorbs him in InuYasha's sight. Naraku admits that he needs Onigumo to re-assemble himself during his periods of vulnerability as a half-demon. InuYasha uses the wind-scar against Naraku and Kagura, but Naraku blocks it and escapes. InuYasha asks Toto-sai how to break any barrier with Tetsusaiga. Myoga tells him to kill a certain ogre-bat who can create a powerful barrier, but the ogre that Myoga mentions is already dead. The ogre's half-human daughter is being raised by the lord of the ogre-bats, her grandfather, to maintain the barrier in her late father's place. When the bats raid Shiori's former village, InuYasha's group saves Shiori's human mother from the angry villagers. The ogre-bat lord had promised to spare the village if they gave him Shiori, but he now refuses to honor that promise and he threatens to kill Shiori's mother. Miroku sucks some of the attacking ogre-bats into his wind tunnel, but the rest hide behind the ogre-bat lord, who is carrying Shiori to generate the barrier around him. The grandfather admits that he killed his son himself for consorting with humans. To avenge her father, Shiori expels all the ogres from the barrier and InuYasha destroys them with the backlash wave. Shiori asks InuYasha to break the magic orb that creates the barrier; her grandfather's ghost emerges from the orb and attacks, but her father's ghost protects her. InuYasha destroys the grandfather's ghost and breaks the orb with Tetsusaiga, which becomes stronger.",

        "Naraku takes Rin hostage to make Sesshomaru kill InuYasha; instead, Sesshomaru goes after Naraku. InuYasha's group catches Naraku's scent and also closes in, but splits up when Kagome detects the jewel shard embedded in Kohaku, who is guarding Rin. Naraku says that he lured in Sesshomaru to be devoured, and they fight. InuYasha uses Tetsusaiga to cut through the spiritual barrier around Naraku's new castle; Naraku sends Kagura to stop him, but also sends demons and saimyosho to watch her. As InuYasha destroys Naraku's demons, Kagura makes a pretense at fighting him and flees. As severed pieces of Naraku's flesh engulf Sesshomaru, InuYasha disintegrates most of Naraku's body with Tetsusaiga. Telling them that Kohaku will kill Rin, Naraku dissolves into smoke. Before Kohaku can kill Rin, Sesshomaru finds them; InuYasha knocks down Kohaku to save his life from Sesshomaru. Kohaku escapes with Kagura. Miroku surprises Sango by comforting her about Kohaku without groping her, but when she mentions this, Miroku pats her breasts. She slaps him. InuYasha visits Kagome in modern Tokyo while she is trying to study for an exam and upsets her by running naked out of a hot shower. Curry rice is also too hot for him. After InuYasha hogs the bed all night, they go back to the feudal era. The small leftover fragments of Naraku under his castle combine into a giant hair-ball demon with a mouth. As Koga and InuYasha argue, the hair-ball comes after their jewel shards. Koga grabs Kagome and carries her to safety as InuYasha fights the hairball, but it breaks away and goes after them, saying that Naraku is going where no one can touch him. Koga rips the hair-ball apart and leaves. Kikyo's soul collectors can find no trace of Naraku's aura. A dying elderly bandit asks her to take his top-knot to Mount Hakurei so its spiritual purification can wipe away his sins. InuYasha's group meets an old incompetent exorcist who leads them to a haunted castle whose lord seems possessed and kills any servants who approach his quarters. At night, an ogre's head appears in the sky above the castle but their attacks go through it without effect.",

        "Naraku takes Rin hostage to make Sesshomaru kill InuYasha; instead, Sesshomaru goes after Naraku. InuYasha's group catches Naraku's scent and also closes in, but splits up when Kagome detects the jewel shard embedded in Kohaku, who is guarding Rin. Naraku says that he lured in Sesshomaru to be devoured, and they fight. InuYasha uses Tetsusaiga to cut through the spiritual barrier around Naraku's new castle; Naraku sends Kagura to stop him, but also sends demons and saimyosho to watch her. As InuYasha destroys Naraku's demons, Kagura makes a pretense at fighting him and flees. As severed pieces of Naraku's flesh engulf Sesshomaru, InuYasha disintegrates most of Naraku's body with Tetsusaiga. Telling them that Kohaku will kill Rin, Naraku dissolves into smoke. Before Kohaku can kill Rin, Sesshomaru finds them; InuYasha knocks down Kohaku to save his life from Sesshomaru. Kohaku escapes with Kagura. Miroku surprises Sango by comforting her about Kohaku without groping her, but when she mentions this, Miroku pats her breasts. She slaps him. InuYasha visits Kagome in modern Tokyo while she is trying to study for an exam and upsets her by running naked out of a hot shower. Curry rice is also too hot for him.

        "Koga stuffs some of Renkotsu's armor into Ginkotsu's artillery; the resulting explosion kills Ginkotsu and wounds both Renkotsu and Koga. Renkotsu flees with Ginkotsu's shard, using it to heal himself. Suikotsu and Jakotsu take Rin as a hostage, hoping to lure Sesshomaru to his death. As Sesshomaru fights both of them, Kikyo fires a sacred arrow into Suikotsu to revert him to Doctor Suikotsu, who pleads for death to stop his killing spree. Kikyo is about to remove his repurified shard when Jakotsu cuts it out and flees into the barrier with it. Suikotsu disintegrates. Except for Miroku and Sango, who are inside the barrier, InuYasha's group brings Koga to a cave to recover. Renkotsu sets the river on fire to drive them from the cave. InuYasha gives his cloak to Kagome and leaps over the river, but Renkotsu hits him and Kirara with cannon blasts and fires a third blast into the cave. When Renkotsu enters, Kagome and the others seem dead at first, but they were shielded by InuYasha's cloak. Having lost his cannon, Renkotsu pulls out fire sticks (dynamite) and lights the fuses. InuYasha pushes Renkotsu out of the cave and both of them fall towards the river with the fire sticks, which explode. Thinking InuYasha is dead, Kagome starts crying; Koga tries to comfort her by saying it wasn't her fault, it was InuYasha's. InuYasha reappears and fights with Koga about Kagome despite both of them ignoring her as she pulls herself together. Miroku and Sango notice that the purification does not extend all the way into a cave, letting them sense Naraku's aura. Inside the mountain, Kagura attacks with some saimyosho that keep Miroku from using his wind tunnel, though he can still use sacred sutras while Sango uses her boomerang. When Kagura separates them and knocks out Sango, Miroku leaps across the gap to reach Sango and opens his wind tunnel, saying that he would rather die from the saimyosho than leave her to be killed. Miroku tries to carry Sango, but collapses from the saimyosho's venom. Renkotsu, who threw away the fire sticks at the last moment, emerges downstream and encounters Bankotsu. Jakotsu gives Suikotsu's shard to Bankotsu who says that he's the only one he trusts. Reluctantly leaving Kagome in Koga's care, InuYasha enters the mountain alone in search of Sango and Miroku. When InuYasha reaches the barrier's limit for a half-demon, Renkotsu blasts him further in with his cannon, hoping to kill him; instead, InuYasha transforms into his human form (even without the new moon) and runs into a cave. Renkotsu sends Jyakotsu in after him. Miroku tells Sango to go on by herself, but she cries and says that she would rather stay and die with him. They realize they have crossed back into the purifying barrier, preventing Naraku's demons from finishing them off; Miroku also recovers from the saimyosho venom. They find the temple containing the mummified \"living Buddha\", Saint Hakushin, who turns out to be alive.",

When Renkotsu enters, Kagome and the others seem dead at first, but they were shielded by InuYasha's cloak. Having lost his cannon, Renkotsu pulls out fire sticks (dynamite) and lights the fuses. InuYasha pushes Renkotsu out of the cave and both of them fall towards the river with the fire sticks, which explode. Thinking InuYasha is dead, Kagome starts crying; Koga tries to comfort her by saying it wasn't her fault, it was InuYasha's. InuYasha reappears and fights with Koga about Kagome despite both of them ignoring her as she pulls herself together. Miroku and Sango notice that the purification does not extend all the way into a cave, letting them sense Naraku's aura. Inside the mountain, Kagura attacks with some saimyosho that keep Miroku from using his wind tunnel, though he can still use sacred sutras while Sango uses her boomerang. When Kagura separates them and knocks out Sango, Miroku leaps across the gap to reach Sango and opens his wind tunnel, saying that he would rather die from the saimyosho than leave her to be killed. Miroku tries to carry Sango, but collapses from the saimyosho's venom. Renkotsu, who threw away the fire sticks at the last moment, emerges downstream and encounters Bankotsu. Jakotsu gives Suikotsu's shard to Bankotsu who says that he's the only one he trusts. Reluctantly leaving Kagome in Koga's care, InuYasha enters the mountain alone in search of Sango and Miroku. When InuYasha reaches the barrier's limit for a half-demon, Renkotsu blasts him further in with his cannon, hoping to kill him; instead, InuYasha transforms into his human form (even without the new moon) and runs into a cave. Renkotsu sends Jyakotsu in after him. Miroku tells Sango to go on by herself, but she cries and says that she would rather stay and die with him. They realize they have crossed back into the purifying barrier, preventing Naraku's demons from finishing them off; Miroku also recovers from the saimyosho venom. They find the temple containing the mummified \"living Buddha\", Saint Hakushin, who turns out to be alive.",
        "Koga stuffs some of Renkotsu's armor into Ginkotsu's artillery; the resulting explosion kills Ginkotsu and wounds both Renkotsu and Koga. Renkotsu flees with Ginkotsu's shard, using it to heal himself. Suikotsu and Jakotsu take Rin as a hostage, hoping to lure Sesshomaru to his death. As Sesshomaru fights both of them, Kikyo fires a sacred arrow into Suikotsu to revert him to Doctor Suikotsu, who pleads for death to stop his killing spree.

Kagome shoots a sacred arrow at Naraku to break his control of the wind-scar and free Koga. Naraku collapses Mount Hakurei onto InuYasha's group, hoping to crush them.

        "Kagura storms Goryomaru's temple, using demon corpses as her strike force. Goryomaru grabs Kagome, and strengthened by the shard she carries, fires his light rays at Kagura. He blasts a hole in Kagura's chest. Severely injured, Kagura breaks off the attack. She flies away and collapses in a stream near Sesshomaru who callously ignores her plight. Little Rin attempts to rescue her but is swept away by the rushing water. Jaken tries to help, but eventually, Sesshomaru has to save all three. Kagura heals and tells him the location of Goryomaru's temple where she now knows the infant was hiding. Kagura returns to the temple with Hakudoshi who begins battling Goryomaru. Inuyasha and the gang arrive to witness Hakudoshi behead Goryomaru. Kanna and the infant appear, and Hakudoshi covers their retreat. Kagura follows and allows the Inuyasha and the gang to discreetly trail her. The group enters an ogre-shaped cave. Naraku appears and tries to take the shard Kagome is carrying. The ogre-shaped cave comes alive. Miroku tries to destroy Naraku with the wind tunnel but is poisoned by the saimyosho, Naraku's demon wasps. Naraku leaves, and the group is stuck in the belly of the ogre who is beginning to digest them. Inuyasha tries to blast out using diamond spears, but Naraku has strengthened the walls. Desperate, Inuyasha takes the shard from Kagome and embeds it in Tetsusaiga. The evil aura from the ogre taints the shard and then flows into Inuyasha. He turns into full-demon form. Before Inuyasha can go on a rampage, Kagome flings her arms around him and purifies the tainted shard. Despite the acid burning her legs, Kagome holds onto Inuyasha, who still in full-demon form but clear-eyed and clear-headed, is able to use enhanced diamond spears to break out of the ogre's belly. Meanwhile, Kikyo meets Kanna who is fleeing with the infant. A surprise attack from Moryomaru prevents Kikyo from killing the infant. Naraku gives Kagura the task of guarding an imprisoned and very-much-alive Goryomaru. The group follows rumors of a traveling medicine man who has a potion that counteract all poisons.

        "Kagura storms Goryomaru's temple, using demon corpses as her strike force. Goryomaru grabs Kagome, and strengthened by the shard she carries, fires his light rays at Kagura. He blasts a hole in Kagura's chest. Severely injured, Kagura breaks off the attack. She flies away and collapses in a stream near Sesshomaru who callously ignores her plight. Little Rin attempts to rescue her but is swept away by the rushing water. Jaken tries to help, but eventually, Sesshomaru has to save all three. Kagura heals and tells him the location of Goryomaru's temple where she now knows the infant was hiding. Kagura returns to the temple with Hakudoshi who begins battling Goryomaru. Inuyasha and the gang arrive to witness Hakudoshi behead Goryomaru. Kanna and the infant appear, and Hakudoshi covers their retreat. Kagura follows and allows the Inuyasha and the gang to discreetly trail her. The group enters an ogre-shaped cave. Naraku appears and tries to take the shard Kagome is carrying. The ogre-shaped cave comes alive. Miroku tries to destroy Naraku with the wind tunnel but is poisoned by the saimyosho, Naraku's demon wasps. Naraku leaves, and the group is stuck in the belly of the ogre who is beginning to digest them. Inuyasha tries to blast out using diamond spears, but Naraku has strengthened the walls. Desperate, Inuyasha takes the shard from Kagome and embeds it in Tetsusaiga. The evil aura from the ogre taints the shard and then flows into Inuyasha. He turns into full-demon form. Before Inuyasha can go on a rampage, Kagome flings her arms around him and purifies the tainted shard. Despite the acid burning her legs, Kagome holds onto Inuyasha, who still in full-demon form but clear-eyed and clear-headed, is able to use enhanced diamond spears to break out of the ogre's belly. Meanwhile, Kikyo meets Kanna who is fleeing with the infant. A surprise attack from Moryomaru prevents Kikyo from killing the infant. Naraku gives Kagura the task of guarding an imprisoned and very-much-alive Goryomaru. The group follows rumors of a traveling medicine man who has a potion that counteract all poisons.

        "Sent to find the demon Hitoukon, who can merge with weak forms and control them, Kohaku is injured and lets the Hitoukon escape. A father and son invite Kohaku to stay for the night, but the Hitoukon takes over the son's body. Kohaku remembers being manipulated into killing his own father, and wants to save the boy. Inuyasha's group chases after the Hitoukon and expels it. While Inuyasha takes care of the boy, Kohaku meets Sango again, but runs away to keep anyone from finding out that he is acting for himself. Hakud\u014dshi convinces Kagura to let Goryomaru escape from a castle, against her orders from Naraku. While Sango and Miroku are lured away by rumors about bandits, Goryomaru finds Kagome and Shippo hiding with InuYasha in his new-moon human form. He takes their jewel shard and absorbs it, then shows his true identity as Mouryoumaru, now with a soul and the ability to absorb youki (demon power). Sesshomaru appears with Jaken, who tells him that their crystal for detecting Naraku's heart shows no youki. Sesshomaru refuses to say where he got the crystal, but Mouryoumaru realizes that it came from Kagura and tells her to bring him Kohaku's shard or be absorbed herself. Hakud\u014dshi is also seeking the shard as part of the plot to replace Naraku with Mouryoumaru. Kagura lends a flying plume to Kohaku so he can escape.",
