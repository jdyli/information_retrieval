        "In the distant Trump Kingdom, a lone PreCure named Cure Sword is seen fighting a desperate battle against an unbeatable enemy. Meanwhile on Earth, student council president Mana Aida is helping look after the students of \u014cgai First Public Middle School during a school trip to the Clover Tower in Tokyo. Whilst visiting the mall with her friend, Rikka Hishikawa, she spots popular idol Makoto Kenzaki, helping to return a curious medallion that she drops whilst her bodyguards escort her out. Whilst visiting an accessory stand, Mana spots a similar looking item known as the Cure Lovies and is given it by its shopkeeper. As Mana and Rikka wait in line to get to the top of the Clover Tower, a mysterious boy named Ira manipulates the heart of an impatient customer, transforming his selfish thoughts into a crab-like monster known as a Jikochu, which causes havoc before heading up to the top floor. Fearing for a young girl who went ahead of her, Mana chases after the Jikochu, followed closely by a fairy named Sharuru. After getting the girl to safety, Mana is approached by Sharuru, who transforms into the Lovely Commune, asking her to transform. As Mana struggles with figuring out how to transform, Cure Sword appears and defeats the Jikochu, returning the now purified heart to its rightful owner.

Hearing the plea of help from the heart inside the Jikochu, Mana gains a new Cure Lovies that enables her to use her purifying attack, My Sweet Heart, to defeat the Jikochu. Afterwards, Mana tries to make friends with Cure Sword, but she refuses, preferring to be alone. On the way back, Mana tells Rikka about her becoming a Pretty Cure, although she doesn't believe her. As Mana heads to Rikka's house to tell her more, she is promptly informed by Sharuru and her fellow fairies, Rakeru and Rance, that she is supposed to keep her identity a secret so that she doesn't drag others into her fight. Mana's attempts at keeping herself from not telling Rikka about it only serves to make her worry.

After getting the other students to safety, Mana decides to place her trust in Rikka and transform in front of her. Mana ends up getting frozen in place by the Jikochu's stop light, but Rikka manages to push a button on its back which changes its lights to green, allowing Mana to move again and defeat it. After the battle, Rikka gives her thanks to Mana for trusting in her.",

        "The girls find themselves in the ruined Trump Kingdom, separated from their partners and beholding the fiercesome King Jikochu looming in the distance. As Davi helps the other fairies search for the girls, both she and Makoto explain what happened to the Trump Kingdom. Makoto was once a warrior and songstress who served the Trump Kingdom's princess, Marie Ange. Then one day, the kingdom was attacked by the Jikochu, who turned the hearts of its citizens into its large army. Ange managed to seal King Jikochu into a dormant state, but exhausted her energy in doing so. After sending the newly born Sharuru, Rakeru and Rance to search for the PreCure, Makoto and Ange escaped through a portal but become separated when Ange chooses to defend Makoto from Beel's attacks. Finding herself on Earth, Makoto became an idol in the hopes that her songs would one day reach Ange. Makoto explains that King Jikochu gains power from the 'janergy' created from Jikochu, but requires Ann in order to undo the seal placed upon him. The girls are soon chased after by a gang of Frog Jikochu. Makoto tells the girls to leave her behind, but Mana and the others insist that they want to help restore the Trump Kingdom. The group start making their way to the castle, where the mirror that leads to Earth lies. Upon arriving however, they encounter Beel, who cracks the mirror, seemingly trapping them in the Trump Kingdom. Luckily, Mana gives the others courage by theorising they can still use Beel's power to send them back.

        "The girls find themselves in the ruined Trump Kingdom, separated from their partners and beholding the fiercesome King Jikochu looming in the distance. As Davi helps the other fairies search for the girls, both she and Makoto explain what happened to the Trump Kingdom. Makoto was once a warrior and songstress who served the Trump Kingdom's princess, Marie Ange. Then one day, the kingdom was attacked by the Jikochu, who turned the hearts of its citizens into its large army. Ange managed to seal King Jikochu into a dormant state, but exhausted her energy in doing so.

Makoto explains that King Jikochu gains power from the 'janergy' created from Jikochu, but requires Ann in order to undo the seal placed upon him. The girls are soon chased after by a gang of Frog Jikochu. Makoto tells the girls to leave her behind, but Mana and the others insist that they want to help restore the Trump Kingdom.

The girls take Makoto to the dentist to get it treated, but becomes scared of the dentist's instruments and runs off. As the girls try to convince Makoto to get her cavity treated, Marmo creates a Cavity Jikochu that Makoto is too afraid to fight against, which in turn causes Ai to cry and power up the Jikochu. Receiving some encouragement from Aguri, who reminds her of Ange, Makoto manages to overcome her fear and help defeat the Jikochu. Afterwards, Makoto gets her cavity fixed and encourages Ai to take care of her teeth."
