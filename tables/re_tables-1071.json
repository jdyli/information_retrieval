Not wanting Axl to kill Anders, he drives to the empty football stadium where Anders is hiding and contemplating his actions. After a short discussion of how Anders was pulled unwillingly by Bragi and I\u00f0unn's connection, Mike relents his anger and takes Anders to the rest of the family at his bar, (which has closed for business so that Mike and Michelle can renovate) where in a fit of rage, Axl throws Anders violently at a pile of rubble, which cuts deeply across Anders's neck. Believing that he has killed his brother, Axl flees and hides in a container. Michelle then takes Yggdrasil, and uses her powers to save Anders's life, though due to a lack of blood in his head, he keeps passing out and falling over. Mike finds Axl and tells him that Anders is fine, then convinces him to forgive Gaia.
