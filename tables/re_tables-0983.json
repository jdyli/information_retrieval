At school, Scott and Stiles see a bloodied school bus outside and Scott worries that he actually killed Allison, but is relieved to see her alive and well. In class, Scott and Stiles see the real victim, deeply injured, from the bus attack. Worried, Scott turns to Derek for help on controlling his animal side. Derek agrees to help as long as Scott promises him an unknown favor. He then sends Scott to the bus where he discovers (through flashbacks) that he didn't attack the bus driver but was trying to help him instead. Feeling better, Scott goes on a group date with Allison, Lydia and Jackson, where Jackson's suspicions of Scott increase. Stiles informs Scott that the bus driver has died from his wounds. Angry, Scott heads to Derek's house where they fight as werewolves until Derek reveals to Scott that he wasn't the one who bit him. Scott learns there is another wolf, a powerful Alpha werewolf, who actually bit him. Derek hopes to use Scott's connection to the Alpha werewolf to find him and for Scott to help (the promised favor).",

Angry, Scott heads to Derek's house where they fight as werewolves until Derek reveals to Scott that he wasn't the one who bit him. Scott learns there is another wolf, a powerful Alpha werewolf, who actually bit him. Derek hopes to use Scott's connection to the Alpha werewolf to find him and for Scott to help (the promised favor).",
        "Scott and Allison are making out in a school bus, the adrenaline rush making Scott turn into a werewolf. He proceeds to attack Allison. The events turn out to be a dream. At school, Scott and Stiles see a bloodied school bus outside and Scott worries that he actually killed Allison, but is relieved to see her alive and well. In class, Scott and Stiles see the real victim, deeply injured, from the bus attack. Worried, Scott turns to Derek for help on controlling his animal side. Derek agrees to help as long as Scott promises him an unknown favor. He then sends Scott to the bus where he discovers (through flashbacks) that he didn't attack the bus driver but was trying to help him instead.

        "A woman driving at night is followed by an Alpha werewolf that tries to kill her. The woman shoots at it with her gun. Derek is in the shadows, trying to follow the Alpha werewolf, but is shot in the arm with a wolfsbane bullet by the woman. Scott overhears Allison's dad and the woman, Allison's aunt Kate, saying Derek has 48 hours to live. The next day, Derek goes looking for Scott at his school and asks Jackson where he is. Jackson irritates him instead and Derek grabs the back of his neck, causing scratches from his wolf claws on Jackson's skin. After school, Stiles and Scott see Derek and he tells them he needs a wolfsbane bullet like the one the hunter used on him. Stiles is left with Derek while Scott goes to Allison's house to find the bullet. Scott is forced to stay for an awkward dinner while trying to find the bullet, and Stiles, having a hard time taking care of Derek, takes him to the vet's office. With Derek's health rapidly declining, Derek plans to have Stiles cut his arm off if they run out of time, since he will die if the wolfsbane reaches his heart. Scott finds a wolfsbane bullet in Kate's bag and takes one, making it to the vet's office right before Stiles starts cutting Derek's arm. Derek uses the wolfsbane in the bullet to supernaturally heal his wound. Scott admits the hunters of Allison's family seem like good people. To prove him wrong, Derek takes Scott to see his badly burned uncle, solemnly explaining that a fire killed his entire family 6 years ago, started by hunters who went against their own rules; it is hinted that Kate was one of those hunters.",

Scott asks Derek to teach him how to control his changes and Derek agrees to do so if he stays away from Allison, as she is a distraction. Scott agrees but goes to see Allison anyway.

Allison goes to the school with Jackson and Lydia after she gets a mysterious text from Scott saying to meet him at the school. Soon enough, everyone gets trapped inside the cafeteria. Scott reveals he never sent Allison any text. Jackson, Lydia and Allison demand to know what's going on. Not knowing what to say, Scott lies that Derek is the one after them. Stiles calls his father, the sheriff, despite wanting to keep him safe. The group flees into a science classroom, where they find a locked door, which leads to a fire escape. Scott looks for the janitor's body to get the keys. He follows the janitor's scent to the gym, and finds the body under the bleachers. He comes face-to-face with the Alpha werewolf, who howls, causing Scott to transform painfully. Jackson also reacts to the howl, due to his scratches. Scott makes his way back to the classroom as a wolf but is stopped by Allison's voice. He changes back just as Stiles' father arrives with the police. Outside, safe and free, Scott sees the vet, mysteriously okay. Scott tells Stiles that the Alpha werewolf never planned to kill them at all; the Alpha werewolf actually wanted Scott to kill everyone himself so that he could join the Alpha werewolf's pack. Scott admits this is dangerous because in werewolf form, he actually wanted to kill them all. Allison breaks up with Scott, feeling she can't trust him.",

Allison goes to the school with Jackson and Lydia after she gets a mysterious text from Scott saying to meet him at the school. Soon enough, everyone gets trapped inside the cafeteria. Scott reveals he never sent Allison any text. Jackson, Lydia and Allison demand to know what's going on. Not knowing what to say, Scott lies that Derek is the one after them. Stiles calls his father, the sheriff, despite wanting to keep him safe. The group flees into a science classroom, where they find a locked door, which leads to a fire escape. Scott looks for the janitor's body to get the keys. He follows the janitor's scent to the gym, and finds the body under the bleachers. He comes face-to-face with the Alpha werewolf, who howls, causing Scott to transform painfully. Jackson also reacts to the howl, due to his scratches. Scott makes his way back to the classroom as a wolf but is stopped by Allison's voice. He changes back just as Stiles' father arrives with the police. Outside, safe and free, Scott sees the vet, mysteriously okay. Scott tells Stiles that the Alpha werewolf never planned to kill them at all; the Alpha werewolf actually wanted Scott to kill everyone himself so that he could join the Alpha werewolf's pack.

At school, Scott begins showing bizarre behavior unlike himself and hallucinating, results of the coming full moon. Stiles and Scott plan to keep Scott locked up during the full moon, for fear that he may kill someone under its influence. Prior to lacrosse practice, Stiles asks Scott if he can ask Lydia if she likes him (Stiles). However Scott approaches Lydia only to ask if Allison still likes him (Scott); Lydia shifts the conversation and she and Scott make out. Scott later lies to Stiles, and is incredibly violent during practice. Allison and Jackson bond and talk, both agreeing that Derek was not their attacker. That evening, Stiles handcuffs a predatory Scott to a radiator to protect him from himself and to get revenge on him kissing Lydia. Scott goes wild, transforms and escapes.

Jackson finds a claw-nail on his car, left by Scott, and realizes that it matches the hole in Scott's pierced glove that he found in \"Second Chance at First Line\".",

The Alpha werewolf punctures Scott's neck, showing him what really happened during the fire and the murders through flashbacks. While looking for her family crest necklace, Allison finds the sharp end of an arrow left behind by Kate and tries it out in the woods with Lydia. She shoots Scott with a taser, thinking him to be an intruder. She apologizes and Scott reveals that he was there to return her necklace. Allison later visits Scott's house, wanting to talk to him. At the same time, they see that Scott's mom, Melissa, is preparing for a date. Scott opens the door to see that Melissa's date is the Alpha werewolf. The Alpha werewolf plans to convert Melissa into a werewolf as a means of coercing Scott to join the pack. Scott leaves Allison in his bedroom to follow his mom and manages to thwart the Alpha werewolf's plan. After entering the Hale property, Scott appears to save Jackson from being killed and Kate interferes. Scott gets shot and the town vet carries him back to his clinic. When he takes the bullet out of Scott's body, he reveals that he only works healing cats and dogs 90% of the time, implying that the other 10% are werewolves. Kate tells Allison the family secret and it's revealed that she's got Derek chained against the wall, torturing him."

        "The winter formal is coming up at the school. Kate explains about werewolves and werewolf hunters to Allison by using Derek as an example. While the vet is taking care of Scott, he is accosted by Peter, who threatens him. The vet however, refuses to give Scott to him. Peter throws furniture at the wall next to him when he is unable to approach due to mountain ash. Coach Finstock informs Scott that due to his academic standing, he won't be allowed to attend the dance. This concerns Scott and Stiles, who are aware that the Alpha werewolf is after Allison. Scott pleads with Jackson into asking Allison to the dance to protect her. When Jackson refuses, Scott shifts into a werewolf and forces Jackson to ask her, while Allison convinces Lydia to ask Stiles. They go shopping for formal clothes, where Peter approaches Allison. However, Scott's quick thinking pulls her away from him. That evening, Kate speaks to Derek, revealing that the two were in a relationship at one point but that she betrayed him. Kate figures out that Scott is the second Beta werewolf. At the dance, Jackson has gotten drunk and is reluctant to spend time with Allison. Stiles has success in wooing Lydia but she is on the lookout for Jackson. Scott also arrives and confesses to Allison that he loves her, leading to a kiss. Jackson drunkenly stumbles into the woods and sees what he thinks is a werewolf. He demands to be changed, only to see that the silhouettes are that of werewolf hunters, led by Mr. Argent. Jackson reveals Scott's identity to them. Lydia leaves to find Jackson. Stiles finds Jackson instead, who is in a confused daze. Lydia walks out to the field, where she is brutally attacked by Peter. Peter asks Stiles where Derek is, threatening to kill an unconscious Lydia. Scott and Allison go to the school buses for privacy and Allison enters a bus, beckoning Scott to come in. Before he can, Scott is blocked in between two cars, one of which is driven by Chris Argent. By the time Scott looks up, he has transformed into a werewolf, revealing his identity to a horrified Allison.",

        "Scott, now in his werewolf form, runs away from the Argents. Chris is outraged that Kate told Allison everything beforehand and forces Kate to retreat with Allison to Washington until the Alpha werewolf is put down. Allison tries to come to terms with the fact that Scott is a werewolf. The Alpha werewolf forces Stiles to help him find Scott and Derek, revealing that Lydia - if she doesn't die - will become a werewolf. With Stiles's help, he locates the two, while Scott finds Derek. When Derek refuses to help him, Scott reveals that Peter killed the previous Alpha werewolf (Derek's sister) to become the Alpha werewolf. At the hospital where Lydia is, Jackson and Stiles are approached by Chris Argent and his team; Stiles reveals that Kate was the one who burned down the Hale household. By doing that, Kate violated the werewolf hunter's code of not killing the innocent, as there were children and humans in the house when the fire was set. Scott and Derek they are attacked by Kate and Allison, only to be stopped by Chris, who confronts Kate after realizing her true nature. He threatens to kill her if she doesn't take the gun off Scott, whom he realizes never killed anyone. Just then, Peter reveals himself and a battle ensues between Peter, Kate, Chris, Scott, Derek and Allison. Peter slits Kate's throat in revenge for burning down the Hale house, killing her. Derek is soon knocked out in the battle, leaving Scott to fight the Alpha werewolf. Jackson, Stiles and Allison help Scott defeat the Alpha werewolf. Before Scott can get the cure by killing Peter, Derek cuts Peter's throat in vengeance for his sister's death and thus becomes the new Alpha werewolf, a fact he takes to gleefully. Allison kisses Scott and says she loves him. Later, Scott and Stiles check on Lydia--she's not healing like a werewolf would, so Stiles wonders what she is now, if not a werewolf. Jackson approaches Derek and demands the bite. Derek grins maliciously and bears his fangs; it is left ambiguous as to if he really does bite Jackson.",

        "On their way to Central, Edward and Alphonse stop at a train station where they hear of an alchemist named Majhal, whose name had appeared several times in their father's correspondences relating to human transmutation, and decide to pay him a visit in the area. Upon entering Majhal's village, they encounter a girl named Clause, who tells them that a zombie has been murdering several of the villagers, her older sister being one of them. Clause petitions the brothers to avenge her sister's death, but Edward is skeptical of the whole situation. Upon meeting Majhal, he tells the brothers that the mysterious zombie is believed to be his former lover Karin, who died in an accident several years ago. After some more investigation, the brothers discover that Majhal has been attempting to revive Karin by using mannequins that look like her, and using alchemy to attach the souls of the village girls he has kidnapped to the mannequins, kidnapping Clause to use her soul. Edward discovers that Karin had not died, but initially lost her memories and has aged. Once her memories returned, she had sought out Majhal, but he was already too possessed by his passions of reviving Karin to recognize her. Majhal refuses to accept the wrinkled old woman who has been supporting him as his Karin, and he attempts to kill Edward. Edward knocks Majhal's weapon out of his hand, which flies into the air and accidentally impales Majhal, killing him. Clause reverts to dressing femininely and sees the brothers off as they continue on their journey.",

        "Lust, Envy, and Gluttony are in a restaurant discussing Greed's recent death. As they leave, a car wreck outside causes a small boy to become injured. The mother's cry for help brings forth a man who heals him using a ring similar to the one that Cornello wore in Lior. Lust watches the man heal the child, and as he turns to the crowd as sees her, she recognizes him as Lujon, a man from her past. They catch up in the restaurant, where a flashback shows us how Lust and Gluttony watch the results of a landslide and its victims. As they watch, a rescue crew approaches, containing Lujon, and he rescues a girl from the pile. Meanwhile, Ed, Al, and Winry, while riding in a cart South to the Ishbalan camp, must save a girl from a band of thugs in the forest. She reveals her name is Lydia, and that she is looking for a man named Lujon, who is supposed to be finding a second Philosopher's Stone to save the people of their village from the return of a plague. As Lujon, Lust, and Gluttony ride back together to his village, Lujon reveals that the power in his Philosopher's Stone has waned considerably. The flashback continues, revealing how Lujon's failed attempts to cure the first onslaught of the plague provoked Lust into teaching him the refined arts of alchemy. As they study together, Lujon falls in love with her; however, Lust only stays with him because he invokes faint memories in her mind that she cannot identify. Once he has learned the secrets to curing the illness, he manages to save his fiance Lydia from death's grip. On the day of their wedding, Lujon leaves her at the altar for Lust, who unsuccessfully commands her to go to him. Once he leaves, she laughs with Envy about the success of their plan. In present time, Lujon embraces Lust in the village before saving his people, exclaiming how he won't let her leave him this time. Before he can let her go, Lust stabs him, killing him. The villagers all perish, and minutes later Ed and company arrive to witness the tragedy. Lydia runs into the fog before Ed can stop her, and is found lying dead next to Lujon's corpse, succumbed to the disease as Lust rides away in her carriage.",

He is of below-average intelligence, which his family attribute to his being trapped in a freezer during a childhood game of hide and seek. Despite his simple ways, Van is shown to be very caring and fiercely loyal to those whom he loves. He is best friends with Munter, and the two start Tool Guys, a handyman business, together. He is also Van's best man at his wedding to Casey. In season 1 Van gets engaged to Draska, but she changes her mind and runs away from the wedding. In season 2 he reunites with his childhood sweetheart Aurora Bay and they become engaged, but she is then killed in a motorbike accident. Van becomes extremely depressed and gets back together with Draska, who fakes a pregnancy in order to keep him. He later dates his father's ex-girlfriend Sheree Greegan, until she attempts to kill him by staging a house fire, and leaves the country. He believes himself to be the father of her twins. In season 6 he falls in love, and in the finale marries, Elena, a Russian girl he met while doing a course at Unitec."

He also has an illegitimate teenage son, whom Pascalle slept with during her promiscuous years, and a deceased infant daughter with Cheryl. At the start of season 1 he is sentenced to prison for four years, provoking Cheryl into trying to turn the family away from crime. In season 2 he is released on home detention after Jethro finds evidence that Judd had planted some evidence. Wolf walked out on his family halfway through season two due to Cheryl's affair with Judd, plus the fallout from the robbery of some motorbike gangs, but ended up coming back at the end of season three. At the end of season three and during season four he had a relationship with Sheree Greegan, but at the end of season 4 he dumps her to go back to Cheryl, who rejects him. He leaves the country and in season 6 is revealed to be in Australia with his brother, Gary Savage. Throughout the show he opposes Cheryl's plan for the family to 'go straight' and repeatedly tries to get his sons (but not his daughters) involved in his criminal enterprises. All the West children look up to Wolf to some extent, although less so as the show progresses."
