        "Kai is brought before \"The Commission\", who, in a room full of candles, endeavour to civilly interrogate him, exploring his human evil. Kai is not interested, and requests to be thrown off the tower. The adjudicatrix asks him whether he has killed anyone as an assassin. Kai then delivers his famous speech: \"I have killed mothers and their babies. I have killed great philosophers and proud young warriors. I have killed the evil and the good, the intelligent, the weak and the beautiful, but it's been a while since I slaughtered a whole room full of petty bureaucrats\". Meanwhile, Stan encounters an amateur surgeon, who feels that he has parts that \"he'd feel better without\". Prince plays good guy, and dies saving Stan. He wanted Stan to love him. Xev plays with some girls who like bear traps."

Sue Ellen accepts J.R.'s offer of marriage, leaving a disappointed Clayton holding an unused engagement ring and Cliff more despondent then ever. Bobby and Pam find new evidence about Christopher's birth, making Bobby furious at J.R. for using the child as a pawn in his efforts to control Ewing Oil. Lucy resists pressing rape charges against Roger, but agrees to a pregnancy test. The celebration at Southfork over J.R. and Sue Ellen's reconciliation is spoiled by news of Cliff's suicide attempt.

Natsu and Gajeel are pit in a two-on-two battle against Sting and Rogue, who they overpower thanks to their doubled magic power and three-month training session, respectively. Determined to fulfill his promise to his Exceed friend Lector to defeat Natsu, Sting activates Dragon Force and fights both him and Gajeel alone. He destroys the arena in the process, but Natsu and Gajeel are largely unaffected by his attacks. After sending Gajeel away on a minecart on the exposed arena basement, Natsu single-handedly defeats Sting and Rogue, earning Fairy Tail first place in the tournament as a result. Gajeel discovers a dragon graveyard beneath the arena, while Jellal discovers the source of the magic power: a hooded young girl.",

This, however, awakens Brain's destructive alternate personality named Zero, who Brain had sealed away with a spell that could only be lifted with the six's defeat. Zero pilots Nirvana to destroy Cait Shelter. Fortunately, the members of Blue Pegasus and Lamia Scale attack Nirvana on board Blue Pegasus's damaged airship, the Christina, saving the guildhall. Hibiki relays the information to stop Nirvana by simultaneously destroying the lacrima crystals powering its legs. Natsu chooses to destroy the crystal guarded by Zero, but is too injured to fight properly. Jellal regains his memories of Natsu and decides to help him while sending Wendy to destroy one of the crystals in his place. Natsu is initially hostile towards him, but Jellal gains his respect by defending him from one of Zero's attacks. He then gives Natsu a golden flame, the Flame of Guilt, which gives Natsu the ability to use Dragon Force and fight Zero.",

Determined to restore the city, the four enter Edolas through the portal and encounter doppelgangers of their guildmates who behave opposite to their missing friends.",

There may be several Executive Producers on a film who may take the lead role in a number of areas, such as development, financing or production. Executive Producers must be excellent negotiators. They need a keen business sense, and an intimate knowledge of all aspects of film production, financing, marketing and distribution. Executive Producers are responsible for the overall quality control of productions. On some productions the Executive Producer role may be combined with other roles, so that as well as raising the finance they may also be responsible for managing the budget during production. Executive Producers must be able to identify commercial, marketable projects. Executive Producers have overall responsibility for the successful financing and marketing of these projects. During production, Executive Producers may be involved in some aspects of scripting, casting, and crewing. Executive Producers often work on a number of projects simultaneously. They are experienced industry practitioners, who have usually worked previously for a number of years in any one of a variety of roles, such as producer, writer, director or script editor. Most have some hands on experience of producing."

        "Bobby saves J.R., Ray, Sue Ellen and John Ross from the Southfork fire. The problems that Bobby has faced because of the fire brings him and Pam together again. Sue Ellen overhears an argument between Pam and J.R. and discovers that she wasn't solely responsible for the car crash that injured Mickey. Sue Ellen tells Clayton she's off the bottle as she no longer feels guilty and decides to devote her life to raising John Ross. Ray continues to blame J.R. for Mickey's ordeal. J.R. points out that he, Bobby and Ray share the responsibility as Bobby and Ray set up the sting operation that sent Driscoll to jail, thereby helping to create the situation that made Driscoll go after J.R..
