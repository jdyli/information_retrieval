Through flashbacks throughout the episode, we learn that George was pushed by Beth-Ann, a loner who was attempting to impress a group of popular girls. In the present day, George has a new intern named Ethan, whom she abuses to make him like her more--a practice she learned from Mason and Rube. Withholding affection works until she takes it too far. Roxy deals with bad guys on her first day as a cop. Mason reaps an older, naked, man who refuses to pass on until he can attend his own funeral. Daisy counsels her reap, a transsexual who is angry at God. Reggie goes shopping with her mother. At the end of the episode, George reflects on wanting to be liked.

And it changed both of our lives forever.\" It is then revealed that while floating, two gravelings entered the pool through an underwater vent but decided not to claim her.

        "George misses her family and decides to pay them a visit, but when reaper boss Rube hears of George's sentimental journey, he forbids her from making it again. Despite the warning, George cannot stop herself from going home...until she discovers the price the dead pay for hanging on to their past. Strapped for money, she, under her new alias Mildred, takes a dreary office job at the Happy Time temp agency, the same place she worked on her last morning alive, where she has to put up with her overbearing and officious supervisor Dolores Herbig. At the Lass' household, the family prepares to have their picture taken, but Joy cannot cope with George's absence. Reggie continues to avoid talking about her feelings as she tries to make spiritual contact with George. George deals with back-to-back souls to reap at a rural gas station which involves a caged bear. As Mason goes to painful lengths to nab more souls, Betty takes a more casual approach, and Roxy continues to settle on her no-nonsense hard-line approach."

In fact, the song title isn't Noreira but Noreia, the name of a Celtic god. In reaction of this and other witchhunts, the band released a song on the \"E.I.N.S.\" Album called \"Enie Tfahcstob r\u00fcf ediona-RAP\" - backwards \"Eine Botschaft f\u00fcr Paranoide\" (A message for the paranoid).

In his book McCauley has traced only 9 tournaments and a small US tour, among these 9 tournaments 2 seemed to be domestic Nationals (British Pro and German Pro) so there left 7 tournaments for the leading pros. Segura entered the 7 and Gonzales played 5 of them and won 4 and reached 1 final. Moreover Gonzales defeated Segura 5 times out of 7 (including some tour matches in Paris in June). In the 1953 July edition of \"Sport\" magazine Budge declared :\"In the past two years Pancho (Gonzales) has won the majority of all the big pro tournaments. He has to be considered the best, at least until somebody proves otherwise.\" In particular Gonzales def. Segura (and Kramer) in Philadelphia Pro and Gonzales def. Kramer in Wembley Pro; Segura overcame Gonzales in U.S. Pro and in a tour match in Paris; in the amateur circuit Frank Sedgman won the Davis Cup with Ken McGregor and the Australian also reached the four finals of the Grand Slam tournaments, winning the last (chronologically) two, Wimbledon and the U.S. Championships. It is very hard to compare Gonzales, Segura, Kramer with Sedgman the best amateur : next year the Australian, turned pro, was dominated by Kramer and Segura but he defeated Gonzales 3 times (later Gonzales regularly beat Sedgman). Then it is possible that Gonzales and Segura were very slightly superior to Sedgman in 1952 but without any certainty."
