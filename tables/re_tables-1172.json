        "Sargasso is revealed to be a field spell which deals damage to players using Xyz monsters. Vector, Dumon, and Mizar summon their Over-Hundred Numbers: Number 104: Masquerade, Number 102: Star Seraph Sentry, and Number 107: Galaxy-Eyes Tachyon Dragon, while also protecting themselves from Sargasso's effects through the spell card Sargasso's Lighthouse, though Mizar refrains from doing so, in order to fight on equal grounds with Kite. Blinded by his rage, Yuma brings out Utopia Ray V and destroys Masquerade. Just then, Vector seemingly disappears and Ray appears to come back to life, only for him to reveal he was Vector all along. Then, Vector undergoes Bariarphose transforms into his true Barian form. Then, Vector uses a trap to banish Yuma's V cards, restore his life points, and subject Yuma's deck to deck destruction, leaving Yuma with only three cards left in his deck."

As Yuma's group arrives, Rio feels a similar sensation, speaking of a legend behind the castle. Vector and Number 96 reach the central colosseum, where Number 96 comes face to face with the Number's guardian.

After Xyz Summoning Number 64: Sandayu the Vetanuki, Ponta temporarily possesses Yuma and proceeds to waste all of Yuma's cards in a series of misplays. Nonetheless, Yuma manages to win the duel and claim the Number. It is revealed that in the legend of Girag, Ponta was just a stray animal picked up by Girag and had the ability to transform himself into a duplicate of Girag, allowing Ponta to act as his double for battles. However, Ponta was betrayed by Girag, who sent him away before a big battle, making Ponta angry, and his spirit had been sealed in the statue ever since then. Girag defends himself by saying that he drove Ponta away because he knew he was entering a losing battle, and he wanted Ponta to stay alive. Girag, in spirit form, then bursts out of the statue and swallows Ponta, reclaiming his body. He then departs back to Barian World, with Ponta's spirit resting inside him.",

Girag defends himself by saying that he drove Ponta away because he knew he was entering a losing battle, and he wanted Ponta to stay alive.

Back in Astral World, Eliphas makes preparations to summon his Rank 13 monster.",
        "Yuma is protected from Eliphas' attack thanks to Rainbow Kuriboh. Meanwhile, Shark continues living through Nasch's memories, where he looks after the orphaned girl, Iris, as he goes into battle against Vector. There, Shark is contacted by Rio's spirit, who reminds him his fate is his own to make. Going on his own to face up against Vector, Nasch arrives at the labyrinth he visited before and confronts him in a Shadow Game using stone tablets. Vector deals a lot of damage to Nasch with his Gorgonic Guardians, but Nasch manages to summon Abyss Splash and defeat him. After the duel, however, Nasch discovers his men, along with Iris, had all been killed as a result of the shadow game, their souls ascending to Barian World. Having seen all of this, Shark comes to accept the truth that he is Nasch, bitterly realizing that Yuma, Astral, and Kite would soon become his enemies. Back in Astral World, Eliphas makes preparations to summon his Rank 13 monster."
