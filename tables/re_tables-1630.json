Eve discovers that the teenager is in fact Davy's brother, and that the events on the night of his death were linked to the ear. Meanwhile, Stella is attacked by a wayward dog at a woodland shrine, where a mysterious nun, who seems to have stigmata warns her to leave without collecting the evidence required. Joe awakes from his coma to hear Davy is dead, unaware that after the fight on the night of his death, someone else had decided to go after Davy. The team then go in search of Esther's baby, but instead discover a still-born male from forty years ago, and discover that Esther's daughter may in fact still be alive. Joe reveals that Esther's husband, Killigan Snr, requested the bad punch that landed him in hospital, and that Killigan Snr authorised Davy's death.",

Boyd and the team are tasked to investigate and locate the current whereabouts of the skull, before the Sudanese engage another civil war. However, the discovery of a skull, which turns out not to be that of the Madhi, uncovers links to the death of an Asian shopkeeper in East London in 1993. Boyd is relieved when Ahmad comes off hunger strike, on the instruction of his daughter, but soon becomes startled by the number of false alarms in finding the missing Mahdi skull. Michael Leonard informs Stella that he was tortured by Catherine Braithwaite, the CEO of a multinational weapons company, Scott Grey. But Braithwaite has an alibi for the time of the beating, and the team wonder if Leonard is simply trying to implicate her in a crime that she didn't commit, in order to save himself.",

        "James Jenson, a long-term patient in a secure psychiatric unit, is released back into the community. However, on the same day, the wallets of three murder victims from the past are sent anonymously to the wife of one of the victims. Jenson was the prime suspect at the time of the three murders, but was deemed mentally unfit to stand trial, and was instead committed to the psychiatric unit. Their investigation leads them to discover a systematic scheme of abuse in a care home during the 1970s and 80s, and pinpoints the connection between the three victims that was originally unindentified at the time of the original investigation. The first victim, Harry Valentine, was the housemaster who regularly beat the children, a fact which care home owner Bruno Rivelli claims to know nothing about. The second, Dr. Delaney, was a doctor who treated the injuries caused by Valentine, but failed to report the cause. And the third, a local councillor, was killed on the premise that he discovered exactly what was going on - and Rivelli committed a copycat killing.",

They discover that Daniel was committed to a mental institution after killing both of his parents, but his psychiatrist suspects he is cutting adrift and becoming something new. Attempting to track him down to discover how he knew about the buried corpse, Boyd discovers that not only is he unable to remember killing his parents, he has started taking LSD to try and remember who was responsible for the corpse in the garden. When the team talk to former patient Heather Hardiss, they discover that Lennon's doctor, Parke, took all of the patients out of the mental institution in 1967 and instead treated them in a hippy squat, which happens to be the exact same house where the body was found in the garden.

Tracking down the file, he discovers that the case is that of a young girl found stabbed to death on an East London street in May 1945. Boyd discovers that the last person to look in the file was his old colleague Mel Silver, two weeks before her death, and that the pendant sent to Mel after her death belonged to the young girl in question. Discovering that the dagger is in fact the murder weapon, Boyd discovers that it was found by two Polish builders working for the Dusniak family, who then took it to a dealer - who is subsequently murdered. Discovering that the Dusniak family may not be who they claim to be, the family's solicitor, Dennis Holland, admits to Boyd that head of the family, Abigail forced him to witness her father, Marek, signing over powers of attorney to her, shortly before his death at the hands of a cyanide pill.

When they find the remains of a hotel room key on her person, they are lead to the scene of a sixteen-year-old girl tied up in the wardrobe. As the investigation into how or when the girl was kidnapped gets underway, the team discover that shortly before her death, Claire visited a local private clinic in order to obtain some pills to help her with anti-depression. When it is discovered that the doctor of the clinic is in fact the sister of the abducted girl, the puzzle begins to piece together, but CCTV footage spurs Grace into believing that she also had a connection to the doctor in question. After discovering that a similar disappearance took place twenty five-years ago - that of nine year old boy David Drew - and after the sudden death of the doctor, Boyd suspects that Claire's death has seemingly unleashed a predator - The Bag Man - straight from her childhood nightmare.",

After discovering that a similar disappearance took place twenty five-years ago - that of nine year old boy David Drew - and after the sudden death of the doctor, Boyd suspects that Claire's death has seemingly unleashed a predator - The Bag Man - straight from her childhood nightmare."

        "The remains of missing political activist Piers Kennedy are found in a wall beneath London's sewer system, leading the team to re-open the case. They discover that Piers was a former marine, who after retiring from duty, discovered he was suffering from a terminal bone marrow disease, leading his last act to be to infiltrate a peace movement against nuclear weapons and trying to discredit it by hijacking a nuclear convoy on a deserted country lane one night in 1983. The trouble is, however, of the four involved with the hijack, two are already dead - Piers and one of his college associates, Hugo Christie - and the killer is on the look-out for the third perpetrator, Hugo's sister, Lucy. Discovering that the entire case may be built around the fact that the other perpetrator, Murray Stuart, who murdered an MOD policeman by the scene, and has a videotape of the entire incident. The problem is, however, that Murray and Grace were lovers back in the day, forcing Boyd to use Grace as bait to fish Murray out of hiding, and discover the truth behind Piers' brutal murder.",

Unable to understand why his DNA had never been entered into the database, and the even weirder fact that his body had been cremated just two weeks after it was found, Sarah discovers that Karl had been on a watchlist as a possible national threat, following the 7/7 bombings in London, and the fact that his mother reported him to the authorities following his conversion to Islam after he fell in love with a Muslim girl, Nas. Suspecting that he may have been part of a terrorist cell, Boyd discovers that his peers have taken false identities, meaning that not even Karl knew exactly who he was dealing with. Discovering that Nas was actually an informant for the secret services, on the request of fellow lover Mohammed, Boyd uncovers what really happened on the night of Karl's death. But the security services are determined to prevent Boyd from blowing the whistle, and hatch a dangerous plan to take him out.",

Angered by the decision, he decides his last case at the unit will be re-investigating his very first - the disappearance of sixteen homeless boys from the Waterloo Bridge area between 1979 and 1982. Although he hadn't managed to make any headway the first time round, a search of records of unidentified bodies finds a match to one of the missing boys, Pele. And further investigation leads the team directly to a torture chamber just south of the M11.

And when he is framed for Sarah's murder, Boyd realises that time is finally running out, and that he must use his knowledge to fight for justice against a powerful adversary.",

When crime scene examiners find a card in her car with the words 'find them' written on it, and Boyd's phone number on the other side, he decides to re-open the case, much to the dismay of an unhappy Spence. However, his outlandish techniques and open DNA searches allow him to pinpoint a suspect, Jason Block, whom he illegally takes a DNA sample from, in order to prove Block was one of Gemma's rapists.

The Gekirangers attempt to fight Sorisa with little luck before Rin J\u016b Toad-Ken user Maga (who has feelings for Sorisa) intervened because he thought Retu and Sorisa were making out.

To oppose the dance-styles of Sorisa, the Gekirangers must learn some dancing moves themselves from Natsume's teacher.

Rageku then attacks the city and easily defeats Geki Tohja, with Xia Fu's appearance leading to a revelation on the origins of the Seven Kensei and the Three Kenma as the first J\u016bken Masters, until they assumed their current forms and founded the two opposing schools before the Geki -Rin Rebellion that led to the Demons' defeat. Rageku then forces Mere to fight Xia Fu, immobilizing the Gekirangers to ensure no interference. In order to win, Mere uses Infinite Waves on herself to fight at full strength despite her own internal pain. Rio watches while the poison courses through him, until he overpowers Rageku's Ringi and save Mere from sacrificing herself to kill Xia Fu. After a brief fight, Rio defeats Rageku, though she reveals that she was only testing him for his jealousy of Mere being able to overwhelm Xia Fu. Rageku then took Rio and Mere as her disciples while as the Gekirangers start training harder.",

In this training, Jyan becomes attached to his teacher, and they form a bond. Meanwhile, Rin J\u016b Hermit Crab-Ken user Dokariya closed in on the group's location, and uses his Ringi Base-Form Robbing Strike to take over Sharkie Chan to have him suffer as Rageku intended: By having him attack the Gekirangers.

Eruka is defeated by the J\u016bken Armament Triangle Attack of Geki Tohja armaments as Kata and Rageku give life to two statues in the Rin J\u016b Hall, the Confrontation Machine Soldiers Butoka and Wagataku, to assist Rio. When he arrives in the outskirts of the city, he challenges the Gekirangers to battle, assuming Black Lion form and using the Confrontation Machine Soldiers to keep Jyan and Retu at bay while he faces off with Ran. She does her best to try to defeat Rio, but not even her Geki Hammer Bullet-Bullet Ball nor her Mom-Mom Strike can defeat Rio. Retu then fights Rio with his Double Geki Fans, but his Air-Air Slash does nothing against Rio. With Retu defeated, Jyan enters the fray, unable to defeat Rio with either his Geki Saber Thin-Thin Slash or Wave-Wave Slash attacks. He then calls upon Ran and Retu to try to defeat Rio with the Geki Bazooka's Fierce-Fierce Cannon, but even it cannot harm Rio, as he sends an even stronger blast of Rinki at them, leaving Ran and Retu back in their civilian clothing. Jyan is left standing as he staggers towards Rio who uses the Brave-Roar Wave Ringi on Jyan that burns the remnants of his Gekiranger suit off. Rio attempts to finish Jyan off, but Jyan begins to burn with an intense white Geki as he attempts to give Rio a finishing punch. Before he can go through with it, he burns himself out and passes out, saying that Rio is \"Gokin-Gokin.\" Rio recognizes this Geki as the same Geki as that of the White Tiger as Xia Fu shows up and explains that it is the Kageki.

        "Though the Gekirangers completed their training, they have yet to obtain Kageki and Jyan is still disheartened by Gorie Yen's statement and starts rethinking what he is fighting for. But in spite of these facts, the trio made their way to Rio, whom Xia Fu asked why he wants to be stronger. While the fight occurs, Kata and Rageku are collecting Rinki from the people of the city with intend on destroying it once their student wins. Ran attempts to use her fast fists but Rio used the Jelly-Ken style to evade her attempt before swiftly defeating her. Retu tries his hand, but Rio uses the Flying-Ken style which Retu is unable to counter. Jyan attempts to fight Rio, again, but even with the Geki Sabers, he is not a match for Rio. With Jyan's Gekiranger suit burned off, Rio states to Xia Fu that it is his choice to be stronger that is his reason to fight. However Xia Fu reveals that deep down, Rio is still afraid of his past. Refusing to accept that truth, Rio attacks Ran and Retu, leaving them bloodied to Jyan's horror. It was then Jyan realizes that his true reason to fight is to protect everyone. This allows Jyan to finally use his Super Geki Claw and transform into Super Geki Red, negating the Kenma' attack on the city and knocking Rio into a cliff face. Mere sends the Confrontation Machine Soldiers to aid Rio, with Ran and Retu following Jyan's example and become Super Geki Yellow and Super Geki Blue. With their new power, Restu and Ran are able to destroy Butoka and Wagataku while Jyan deals a finishing blow to Rio, defeating him.

Mere, remembering Long's words, decides to follow Hihi to understand the cryptic news he told her. Back at SCRTC, Xia Fu reveals that Gou used a forbidden Geki Waza in an attempt to seal Rio.

But Gou is more vexed that Retesu is a J\u016bken artist, leaving SCRTC in a huff and confronting HiHi with his Shigeki until the presence of a golden aura causes him to transform into a werewolf as the Gekirangers arrive. Retu stays with Gou to try to calm him down while Jyan and Ran go to fight Hihi. Once Gou becomes human again, he refuses to let Retu go after Hihi and brings him to the church where they grew up to remember the events of their last meeting: with Gou having Retu vow to never practice the J\u016bken and focus on his art. Gou then attempts to reason and then punch Retu, but both failed as Retu tells him that he has chosen his path long ago, before being informed by Miki that Ran and Jyan are in trouble.

        "After being injured by the \"Dorinki\"-powered Hihi, the Gekirangers learn from Xia Fu of the Dorinki and were advised not to access the Kageki in their injured state. Retu believes that his brother Gou will assist them as the new Gekiranger, but he refuses, revealing he does not fight for justice and showing his Shigeki as proof before leaving the SCRTC office. At the Rin J\u016b Hall, Rio is marveled by Hihi's new form as Mere reveals that Maku infused the Rinrinsi with his power, attempting to ask the Kenma to give some to Rio too. This resulted with Maku physically rebuffing her, as well as Rio's disappointment at Mere for suggesting that he takes the easy road. Mere leaves in tears, confronted by Long who tells her that Rio's greatest rival, Gou, would be an issue should he become a Gekiranger unless she kills him first. Gou visits a beach before being hit by the mysterious gold cloud and turns into the werewolf. But Natsume was there and managed to calm Gou down back to human form. Gou evaded Natsume only to run into Mere, telling her he has no intent to be a Gekiranger while defending himself until he has to save Natsume from an attack. Miki soon arrives and after Gou realizes that he has a sense of justice, he gains the GongChanger, an item commissioned by Xia Fu long ago. Using it, Gou becomes Geki Violet to defeat Mere.

However, Gou ignores Jyan's praises, making him feel \"Mohe-Mohe\" and runs off for reasons the others cannot figure out. Meanwhile, Maku unearths an army of Confrontation Machine Soldiers hidden within the mountainside, empowering a Butoka/Wagataku pair with his Dorinki to have them destroy the city as his vanguards.

Gou fights in Geki Tohja Wolf, as Ran and Jyan cannot do anything until Retu arrives to the battlefield in Geki Gazelle. Chouda is defeated by both, but not before he created an egg that burrowed underground as he died. Meanwhile, Ken then brings Hanyun to see Bat Li, who thanks her for the charm she made for him long ago and Hanyun is brought to tears as she gives Ken the SoZyuTo to thank him. Ken returns to the group with the SoZyuTo in hand, but Xia Fu scolds him for having sold it in the first place but forgives him for helping Hanyun. Meanwhile, Rio gets into a confrontation with Maku over his whereabouts and a question of loyalty leads to a fight between them.",
        "Though Ken now on the team, it turned out that he lost SoZyuTo and left to find it. Ken took Retu with him, revealing that he actually sold it as they arrive to Chinatown. Once they arrive to the store he sold the SoZyuTo to, they are confronted by its shopkeeper, Hanyon: an elderly woman with a hatred for Geki J\u016bken users. When Ken asked for it back, Hanyun refused to sell it back with her many traps keeping the two at bay. Elsewhere, Kata sends his student, Chouda of the Rin J\u016b Ostrich-Ken to collect more suffering for Maku as Rio returns, giving Mere instructions to find the SoZyuTo. As Chouda begins his attack on the city, Jyan, Ran, and Gou intervene, only to fall for Chouda's deception. When they dispatch with her latest trap, Ken and Retu find an old photograph of a young woman with Bat Li when the Kensei himself appears and attacks the two. However, Ken realizes it is not Bat Li and uses his Geki Hard Diamond grind to reveal that it was actually Hanyun. She tells her story of how she fell in love with Bat Li when he saved her, but he did not fulfill his vow to remain by her side as he promised. The battle with Chouda continues, as he is defeated by the three others in an attempt to destroy him and then grows to his giant size.

        "When Mere returns to the Rin J\u016b Hall after finding the SoZyuTo's whereabouts, she finds Rio fighting Maku and forced to reveal how strong he became. However, even with Dorinki, Rio is still unable to best Maku in combat. At the last second, Mere intervenes by shielding Rio, promising him that she will retrieve the SoZyuTo if he stands down for now. Rio reluctantly accept defeat and soon was in a cell while Maku ponders a suitable punishment. At SCRTC, though offered the SoZyuTo, Xia Fu allows Ken to keep it. However, the rest of the team scolded Ken for having sold it in the first place and his laidback nature. He escapes to meet Sachiko and give her a birthday present, noticing Mere watching him. Once Sachiko leaves, Mere demands the SoZyuTo from Ken, preferring to win it in a fight. But the other Gekirangers intervene and Mere leaves just as Jyan senses a \"Zowa-Zowa\". This leads the team to the new Chouda born from his parent's final Ringi and thus immune to the all attacks but Geki Chopper's. Just as he was about to finish the Beast-Man, Ken sees Sachiko, only to realize it is someone else who tells him that Mere kidnapped the real Sachiko and that she will be returned in exchange for the SoZyuTo. Knocking out Gou, Ken arrives to where Mere is holding his sister hostage, offering that they finish their fight to settle this. Mere accepts and over-powers Ken, who wins barely and Mere accepts defeat. However, Long's prodding forces Mere to send Sachiko to a watery grave and steal the SoZyuTo from Ken. Upon realizing what she has just done, she begins to burn Dorinki, much to Long's approval. After finding Sachiko saved by Gou, Ken and Gou arrive back at the battle with Chouda. The five Gekirangers overwhelm Chouda with their multiple attacks, ending with Geki Chopper's Many-Many Slash. When Chouda uses Wicked Body Overpowering Heavenly Change, the Super Gekirangers defeat him in Geki Fire. Though Ken was ashamed of losing the SoZyuTo, Xia Fu ensures him that he and the other Kensei will handle it as Mere returns to the Rin J\u016b Hall, freeing Rio as they both go to the Beast Origin Village.",

        "At Natsume's school, the star player of the basketball team, Shinichi, was winning the game until his selfishness resulted with the team losing. On his way home, he sees Tsuneki of the Rin J\u016b Fox-Ken style and holds his own for a short time until the Gekirangers arrive to help him. However, he still does not wish to have any help and is captured by Tsuneki as a shield. Geki Chopper is about to save him, but Geki Red stops him to ensure Shinichi's safety. The boy does manage to escape, but so does Tsuneki, who fires an arrow into the air to begin his plan. Jyan tries to befriend Shinichi with Ken, trying to show him the meaning of \"Muni-Muni\" (teamwork), but it ends badly as they are trapped in Tsuneki's Secret Ringi Fox Dimension Great Bomb, which would explode from amassing the energy of those who suffer within it. Ken attempts to hold the stronger Tsuneki him off as Jyan and Shinichi run away. Shinichi learns the meaning of Muni-Muni, as Ken saves him and Jyan from certain doom. The two transform into Super Geki Red and Geki Chopper and use Shinichi's planning to deliver the final blow with the Geki Waza Sharp-Sharp Kageki Slash, negating the Ringi as a result in time. Tsuneki then grows to giant size and fights Geki ElephantFire and Geki Tohja Wolf, with Shinichi and Geki Chopper cheering on. With a basketball like shoot with the EleHammer, Tsuneki is destroyed. At a later basketball game, Shinichi's team wins because he passes the ball to Seiji. Meanwhile, with Rio and Mere gone, Maku takes out his frustration on Kata and Rageku before deciding to go after the two. However, Long confronts Maku over the Rin J\u016bken's leadership, which results in a fight. But Long takes his leave after dodging all of Maku's attacks easily, revealing that the fight was a distraction as Rio and Mere have already arrived at the site of the Beast Origin Village.

However, the Kensei still encased in the D\u014dkokugan makes Jyan feel guilty and he runs off in haste to find Maku to break the Ringi. After drinking the siphoned lifeforce of the Kensei, Maku is challenged by Rio, whom manages to match him without even turning into Black Lion Rio. Maku however, still considers himself superior decides to handle the Gekirangers himself while allowing Rio to live long enough to see his rivals' demise. He uses the entire Rinsi army to attack the city to lure them out, with the Gekirangers fighting the hordes of Rinsi. Jyan sensed a power what he thought to be Maku, but was actually Rio. Rio informs Jyan that if he was the power he sense then he must have surpassed Maku, and the two fight. As Rio thought, they both had become stronger than before due to being affected by the Beast Power Bloom. With that, Rio tells Geki Red to kill Maku and end their masters' war before they settle their own.

However, Maku enlarges and Geki Fire and Geki Tohja Wolf are overpowered by him. SaiDaiOh enters and it and Maku prove to be equals as sun sets on the battlefield. But the Gekirangers' refusal to give up results with a new formation: SaiDaiGeki Fire. With all three Geki J\u016bken qi combined together, Maku is finally destroyed.

        "After getting into a fight with her mother, Natsume runs away and bunks with Jyan with Miki fine with it. The next day, a tired Jyan brings Miki to his room when Natsume starts acting strange, only to find her gone. While searching for her daughter, Miki learns that many other children in the city had mysteriously disappeared without a trace, with horns on their forehead. Jyan and Miki follow some children to find Mere's student, Haku of the Gen J\u016b Unicorn-Ken style, using his Gengi to control the children. While the other Gekirangers hold Mere off, Geki Red and Miki find the abducted children and Haku himself, who reveals his schemes. Jyan assumes Super Form, only to be overwhelmed by Natsume and the other children under Haku's control. But, by eating her daughter's favorite food, Miki manages to get Natsume to break Haku's hold over her, canceling the Gengi on the others. Without his children army, Haku is defeated by Super Geki Red. But Haku enlarges himself, intending to destroy \"the filth\".Geki Fire attempts to fight in vain until Miki personally pilots SaiDaiOh to extract her maternal wrath on Haku. With Natsume cheering her on, Miki destroys Haku. The Gekirangers see Miki and Natsume off, with Jyan feeling warm. While this all occurs, Rio confronts Suugu, asking if they met before. But Suugu's silence provokes him to assume Black Lion form to fight him to confirm his thoughts. Though he lost to Suugu, Rio sees without doubt that Suugu is the one he had vowed to surpass, the man with white tiger's Geki: Dan.",

Jyan attempts to befriend him, but Gou arrives and battles Suugu to Jyan's dismay. Gou is shocked to find that Suugu's fighting stance is the same as Dan, a Beast Arts master who both he and Rio learned from in the past. At SCRTC, Xia Fu cannot believe that Dan still lives as he was killed by Rio long ago. However, Long reveals to Rio that he revived Dan as a puppet that would serve only the Gen J\u016b King, with the masterless Suugu going on a berserk rampage. He overpowers the J\u016bken giants single-handedly before being defeated by SaiDaiGeki Fire as Rio arrives before the team, revealing that his battle with Dan had not truly ended. On the night Rio was to end his rivalry with him, Dan was already gravely wounded prior to the fight, thus Rio was robbed of a true victory. A dying Dan tells Rio that his true rival is one who will defeat him: Dan's own son, Jyan. Jyan is horrified and confused of this new information as Suugu attempted to kill him. Though the others attempt to keep Suugu from killing his son, Jyan expresses his feelings about family while taking Suugu's beating until Rio emerges in a new form, embracing his destiny as the Gen J\u016b King. The four Gekirangers battle the Mythical Generals, only to be overpowered by them before Rio blasts them, allowing Jyan time to train for their final confrontation. Rio and his group take their leave, with the war between the Geki J\u016bken and a fully powered Gen J\u016bken beginning as Jyan is now in a state of utter pandemonium.",

        "While Christmas shopping, Ken and Bion Biao meet a young American child named Carl who hates Christmas. But Ken, misunderstanding Carl, brings him to SCRTC's Christmas party. Eventually fed up with everyone, Carl exits SCRTC in a hurry after knocking down the Christmas tree with Miki the only one who knows the truth. Meanwhile, Mere is thinking of a Christmas present for Rio until Long arrives with one of Suugu's Twin Phantoms, Mythical-Beast Hanuman-Ken user Shuen, sent to cause mayhem across the city with his clones to gather screams from the populance. While Ken and Bion Biao attempt to understand Carl's issues in spite of the language barriers, the other Gekirangers battle the massive army of Shuens while the real one escapes to commit arson. While it all occurs, Ken learns from Carl's father, a North Korean diplomat, that the boy's hatred for Christmas stems losing his mother in a car accident, with Ken reasoning with Carl with his similar path before Shuen arrives. While Bion Biao protects Carl, Ken transforms into Geki Chopper and defeats Shuen with the Super SaiBlade, but Shuen enlarges and the Gekirangers bring out SaiDaiOh, Geki Fire, and Geki Tohja Wolf to battle with Bae commenting while Mere is wearing a special Santa outfit for Rio. Once Shuen is frozen, SaiDaiGeki Fire destroys Shuen. Later, the SCRTC gang resume their party at Carl's house, with SaiDaiOh creating an image of Carl's mother as Ken's present to the boy.",

        "The SCRTC gang heads to a Shinto Shrine on New Years, with Jyan praying for Suugu to become Dan once more, but Xia Fu says such a wish is impossible due to Suguu's nature. Jyan then vows that if his father can never return, then, at the very least, he will defeat/free him on his own. Meanwhile, Long, fearing Jyan's effect on Rio would halt his true power, receives his permission to \"test\" Jyan with Suugu and use it as an excuse to kill him. But Mere begins to ponder Long's motives after hearing Sanyo muttering of a new Rio to come soon, until she is ambushed by Gen J\u016b Cerberus-Ken user Kou, who reveals he's the younger brother of Braco before heading out to attack people to gain a place among the Gen J\u016b Generals. But as Geki Chopper, Super Geki Blue, and Super Geki Yellow battle Kou and defeat him with SaiDaiOh, Jyan finds Suugu and battles him with Long watching the fight while Mere watched him from behind to know his true intent. Jyan's refusal to give up allows him to defeat Suugu, yet couldn't land the deathblow due the feelings for his father. But, due to Jyan's desire to hear him play his ocarina one last time, Suugu reawakens as Dan much to Long's shock. Seeing Jyan to be more trouble than he thought, Long decides to kill him himself. But Suugu took the fatal hit and drove Long away before he collapses in near death. While this all occurs, Gou goes to Michelle Peng to ask for a favor, to master Brusa Ee's most powerful Geki Waza to end the Gekirangers' battle against Rio: the Heaven and Earth Disaster Strike.",

        "After defeating Long with the Gekirangers, Rio returns to SCRTC much to the happiness of his teammates Miki and Gou. But the only ones who are not happy with Rio and Mere living with them are Ran and Retu, who cannot forgive the two for the acts they have committed. To settle this, Rio and Mere set out to perform the Fist Judgement, a ceremonial battle where the judge and sinner would battle to the death. While Retu and Ran spend three days training for the Fist Judgement, Jyan attempts to talk Rio and Mere out of it. Rio tells Jyan that he has found a new purpose, to bring the two branch schools together by first burning Rin J\u016b Hall to the ground. By the third day, the Fist Judgement begins, with Retu fighting Rio while Ran battles Mere. In the middle of the fight, as Rio and Mere deliberately lower their guard, Sanyo immediately stops the proceedings as a revived Long reveals himself. Long then devours Sanyo, an extension of his being, and assumes his true form, the Infinity Dragon, before going after Jyan first for being the one to ruin his schemes. At the last second, Mere takes full brunt of Long's wrath when she shoves Jyan, Ran, Retu from his jaws while being fatally wounded. Jyan asks why Mere would do such a thing, she reveals that she and Rio intend to sacrifice themselves anyway, even if Long had not interfered, thanking Jyan for what she did for them. Geki Tohja Wolf and SaiDaiOh battle Long, but are no match for him. After comforting Mere in her final moments, promising to follow her within minutes, Rio infuses the Gekirangers with the Rinki of the entire Akugata, promising Jyan a rematch, before entering Long's body to destroy him from the inside, killing himself in the process. The Gekirangers' mourning for Rio is cut short as Long regenerates and mocks Rio's sacrifice, saying that can never die. Swearing on Rio and Mere's sacrifice while putting on the Kenma' Bracelet, Jyan intends to stop Long once and for all.",

        "After Long survives Rio's attempt on his life, the Gekiranger battle him for the sake of Rio and Mere, bent on defeating him in spite of the fact that he's immortal. Long assumes his fighting form and overpowers the Gekirangers before attacking the city to take on the task of destroying the world himself. The Gekirangers follow, but Jyan, Ran, and Retu are suddenly overcome as the Ringi Rio had placed on them earlier finally takes effect. The three find themselves in a dream version of the Rin J\u016b Hall, where Rio and Mere reveal the three Kenma in human form. The three Kenma then teach the Gekirangers to master their fighting styles and ultimate technique. Meanwhile, Gou and Ken battle Long on their own, losing to him until the seven Kensei arrive to restrain him in vain as obligated by their J\u016bken way. But Long breaks loose of their Geki Waza and defeat all seven singlehandedly. But Sha Fu reveals they were a distraction as the three Gekirangers arrive, mastering the Kenmas' power to finish Rio's plan and the means to defeat Long: bringing the two J\u016bken schools back into one. Combining their Geki with the Rinki Rio provided them, the three Gekirangers manage to turn the tables on Long, though he still isn't concerned because they can't kill him. The Gekirangers reveal that don't need to as they use the Ringi of Kenma, D\u014dkokugan, to seal Long away into a golden orb. After pondering on what to do with the sealed Long, Jyan suggests to be his jailer, with him, Ran, and Retu deciding to take their own students to ensure Long would never be freed. Three months later, both Ran and Retu become teachers, teaching the J\u016bken to their own pupils with Natsume as Retu disciple as Jyan gives them, Miki, and Xia Fu his goodbyes before taking his leave to see the world and teach the J\u016bken. He then visits Ken at SCRTC Meisters, and then Gou as he and Bae take their own leave to make up for lost time, before beginning his journey. Months later, while showing his skills to a group of children in Hong Kong, Jyan meets a boy who looks similar to a young Rio, taking him under his wing.",

        "When the investigation into a woman defending her daughter from a mugger throws up a link to an unsolved murder from 1990, Boyd and the team investigate. Evidence of a video cassette at the scene leads them to suspect a case involving prostitution, sexual violence and snuff movies, but when the DNA of the woman defending her daughter turns out to belong to Lore Dutana, a Basque national with links to ETA, Boyd suspects that he has unearthed the remains of a terrorist cell. And when Lore goes on the run, the team unearth even more secrets, including links to a Algerian pimp known as BB, who may not exactly be who he says he is. However, little does Lore suspect that one of her old allies, Una Doyle, is out for revenge, and that her children are in danger. As the mystery begins to reveal itself, stories of terrorist organisations training together at an army camp in Libya proves to be the link between the victim, Lore and Una. Boyd attempts to smoke out Una and discover the real truth about what happened that night, and who is responsible for Fatima's death.",

        "The investigation into the murder of prisoner govenor James Redding is re-opened after seven years when his head, missing at the time of the initial enquiry, is unearthed from the bottom of a river. At the time, two initial suspects, Peter Kelleher and Terry Ryan, were questioned, after spending time under Redding in prison. However, they had straight alibis for the night of his death, and no evidence was found at the scene to connect them to the case. It soon transpires that Redding was beating and sexually abusing some of his seriously ill inmates, but before Boyd can get to Peter Kelleher, he escapes on a routine visit to hospital, and then, with the help of his old adversary, kidnaps the prison psychiatrist, who he believes is responsible for the disappearance of six former inmates after they were released from prison. However, on the trail of Kelleher, Eve finds the burial site of the six bodies, as well as the freshly buried body of Kelleher's friend, Ryan. When Boyd discovers the true identity of the killer, he races to the seaside in the hope of finding the prison doctor.",

Initially, the team suspect the victim to be Francis Duggan, a soldier who disappeared six months after his tour of duty and has never been seen since. However, medical records prove that Duggan is not the victim, and for long, Duggan re-appears to attend to his terminally ill mother. New evidence discovers the victim to be Mark Bennett, a soldier with a grievance, after his corporal slept with his girlfriend behind his back.

And when a woman from Iraq turns up, wanting to prove that the soldiers were working for an Iraqi war-lord who had her son killed, the real truth behind Bennett's beef begins to come to light.

Eve discovers a picture of a man was shoved down his throat shortly before his death, and the photo is soon identified as Charles Aniyeke, the only victim of a hospice fire in 1990 in which he was unable to escape. Boyd soon discovers that Andrews was in fact Sam Cohen, Aniyeke's lover, who was not an actual neo-nazi, but infiltrated the gang in order to get the evidence - a video tape - of the gang killing Aniyeke. However, the investigation takes an unexpected turn when Brown kidnaps a young Muslim who has been having an affair with his daughter.

Boyd soon discovers that Andrews was in fact Sam Cohen, Aniyeke's lover, who was not an actual neo-nazi, but infiltrated the gang in order to get the evidence - a video tape - of the gang killing Aniyeke. However, the investigation takes an unexpected turn when Brown kidnaps a young Muslim who has been having an affair with his daughter. The team are forced to race against time to find the location of the missing boy, while also having to discover the reason why every single member of the neo-nazi gang is going to die from AIDS.",

        "The discovery of a corpse in a disused tunnel beside a motorway leads the team to investigate the twelve-year-old murder of Christopher Deardon, who disappeared in 1996 after supposedly leaving the country for an international conference, but actually never left the country, and instead vanished into thin air. Boyd believes the case may be linked to a number of protests which occurred the year before, as the protestors regularly used the tunnels to sleep or camp in. However, Grace suspects that Deardon's death may be a ritualistic killing, a fact which Boyd is skeptical of at first. When the three friends from Deardon's pub quiz team, the awkward squad, are all sent letters with the words 'time to pay' on the front, they all start to remember the tragic events that occurred that night, and begin hallucinating and seeing Deardon's ghost. When two of the three men, Josh Finlay and Harold Bloom, die of heart attacks after having convulsions, the third man is forced to come clean about what really happened, which forces Deardon's son to resent one of his idols.",

        "When Mark Lovell, a man convicted of murdering his adoptive father ten years previously, is cleared on appeal, Boyd is not convinced that he is innocent, and decides to re-open the case. The clue to uncovering the real identity of the killer lies in finding the rest of the family, who disappeared on the night of the murder. With a big inheritance at stake, both parties appear to have a lot to hide. The situation becomes even more compliacted when a body washed up on a nearby beach turns out to be that of Mark Lovell's cousin.

Further renovation works at the house reveal three more bodies buried within, and a dark day for Spencer, who used to live in the house as a child with his mother and father. The identity of the victims reveal that the film's content may not be so ficitional after all. And when Spencer looks into his family history, he discovers that his father may be linked to the mysterious men involved.

Boyd initially suspects that the man's death may be due to the fact he was a conscientious objector in the second world war, but the team suspect otherwise.

Boyd initially suspects that the man's death may be due to the fact he was a conscientious objector in the second world war, but the team suspect otherwise. When the body of a second victim, William Davies, is found in similar circumstances almost fifty-six years later, the trail of clues leads Grace to discover the unsolved murder of Norman Taylor that took place thirteen years after the first victim, which follows the same motive - a nine-inch nail through the head. When Spence discovers that Taylor and Western were in the same regiment during the war, and that Davies was also a member of the same regiment, albeit, under a different name. Realising that the killer is trying to pick off the survivors of the regiment one by one, Boyd and the team try to track down the survivors before they meet the same fate."

        "Boyd and his team face a race against time after a skeleton found in a condemned garage triggers a tragic chain of events. The skeleton is that of garage owner, Gerald Doyle, an student who was reported missing in 1981. An unexploded car bomb found at the scene points to terrorist activity as the cause of death. However, Doyle\u2019s parents produce a set of his diaries, which reveal that he was actually a mole for the intelligence services.

        "Boyd decides to have a second attempt at cracking the case of Alice Miller, a young girl who was raped and murdered five years ago, but for whom the killer was never identified. Although the case was deemed cold at the time, Boyd's second investigation leads to a surprise turn of events, spurring the killer out of hiding, and forcing him to abduct a second girl, Jodie Whitemore. Realising that his actions have resulted in the girl's abduction, Boyd is forced to play catch-up as the killer sends him information regarding the girl's whereabouts. Boyd has Alice Miller's body exhumed, hoping that new DNA tests may reveal the killer's true identity, and provide clues as to the location of the missing girl, Jodie. However, the killer is keen to kill again, and it's a race against time for Boyd to save the missing girl. When the team pinpoint the girl's location, they use Mel as bait to lure the killer out. However, their plan soon backfires, when Boyd discovers that the kidnapper is looking for more than money - he wants revenge on Boyd's team - and Mel is in danger.",

        "When a young woman, Marina, sets alight to an abandoned car in the middle of a busy street, and takes photographs of it as it burns, Boyd is forced to tackle her to the ground, attempting to shield her from the possible explosion. Boyd later discovers that Marina's father died in a car accident a few years previously in the same street, and that Marina refuses to accept that his death was simply an accident. Boyd is intrigued, and reluctantly agrees to investigate. Frankie performs forensic tests on Marina's father's car, and proves that he was still alive after the crash, and could have easily escaped. However, the answers they uncover may mean that the danger to Marina is much greater than any of them had thought possible. Boyd has Marina's uncle, Mike Coleman, and her mother, Gwen, brought in for questioning, while Frankie searches their house. As she finds items that were recovered from the car nine years ago, she suspects that Perry Coleman was being blackmailed by Rod Brogan. When Boyd has the body exhumed, the DNA results surprise everyone.",

        "The team are forced to enlist the help of psychotic serial killer named Thomas Rice, when the one woman who escaped death at his hands, the cool and poised Dr. Clare Delaney, gets a dreadful reminder of her past ordeal and a fearful shock when a playing card is flung at her car windscreen as she sets off to make a house call on a wet, windy, dark night. The team take a second look at Rice's crimes, prompted by Boyd's unshakeable belief that Rice had claimed other, hitherto undiscovered victims. Boyd, who has personal links to the case, and Grace decide to use Mel to lure a confession from Rice, but the plan goes horribly wrong when Rice tries to stab Mel. Reluctanly choosing to continue using his assistance, Boyd tries to protect Dr. Delaney from experiencing her terrifying ordeal once more, at the hands of a copycat assailant. It becomes apparent that Rice might have help on the outside, and it soon becomes crucial that Boyd confronts Dr. Delaney, to find out what went on during her captivity. Why did he spare her life, yet kill all his other victims?",

Grace is intrigued by this strange expression of guilt, but Boyd and the rest of the team are tempted to dismiss it as the meanderings of a dying man. However, the investigation takes a rather abrupt turn when Frankie discovers that Newman did not die of natural causes - and was murdered in such a way to make it look so. The team soon realise there's a lot more to Newman than they first imagined. Added to all that, there's a link to a famous fifties trial in which a gangster was hanged for killing two policemen. The postliminary inquiries into Newman's past and the identities of the possible twelve murder victims uncover a connection to the infamous trial, and execution of a well known gangster. Desperate to get the truth told, the deceased's brother, Frank, recruits a journalist to publish the real truth about his brother's unathorised and untimely killing.",
