In addition \"Inside\" refers to a Death Note being underground, a letter being inside that Death Note, and the fake rules being inside the other notebook; the reader is not supposed to be aware of those aspects when he or she starts reading the chapter. \"Creation\" refers to a piece of dialog from Light that states \"The god of the world creates the rules.\" \"Embrace\" refers to Misa hugging the notebook, Ryuk, and then Light in that order. Ryuk says \"all this girl does is hug things...\" The chapter \"Two Choices\" refers to Rem's decision of whether to save Misa and die or let Misa be captured and put to death. \"Feelings Within\" mostly refers to L's last internal monologue, while it also refers to Light's emotions. Ohba stated that people often asked him what L was trying to say, and that Ohba refused to answer the question and responded by saying that Death Note is about readers discovering their own conclusions about the work.
