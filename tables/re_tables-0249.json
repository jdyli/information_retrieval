The Westrens picked Lara to represent them at the contest, Nathaniel to represent the Challenors at the contest, Rebecca for the Moons, and Emma for the Duncans. Before the contest Meg and Emma worked out their differences from high school where popular Meg had not treated Emma well. The contest consisted of three rounds: knowledge, strength and endurance. In round 1, the trainers sat in rowboats while the champions answered a series of questions. For every wrong answer the trainers had to fill their boat with 4 buckets of water until someone's boat sunk. Emma/Tifiny lost only correctly answering a single question. In round 2, the remaining challengers had to move 5 10kg weights in a pool one at a time. Lara won easily and Nathaniel edged out Rebecca. In the final round champions had to hang off a rope without falling in the pool.",
