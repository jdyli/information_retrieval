The situation does not bother Martin, but Frasier feels uncomfortable at the idea of them sleeping together under his roof, and he expresses his concern to Daphne. She explains that Joe's house is under construction, so given Frasier's feelings she decides to look for her own place. At first this seems like an ideal solution, but after Frasier and Martin spend a whole weekend together without her in the flat, they begin to realize just what a calming influence she was between them.

        "Niles is scanning the society page when he sees a picture of Maris with another man. Although Niles is annoyed at first, Martin tries to convince him that he should try to get out a bit as well. This he does by arranging to take Marjorie Nash, the Fruit-At-The-Bottom yogurt heiress to one of Niles' society events, the Snow Ball. He then realizes that he cannot dance but Daphne then offers to teach Niles everything he needs to know. Just as soon as Niles is getting into the swing of things, Marjorie calls to say that she cannot make it. Niles prefers not to tell Daphne, but having already seen the way he looks at her, Martin says that he might end up saying something he would regret and tells him to inform Daphne of the truth, which Niles does. Daphne then suggests she go with Niles to the Ball instead, an invitation that Niles accepts. At the ball, Niles and Daphne do a series of dancing that he learned to try to show everyone at the ball that he is not mourning his divorce. When a tango starts playing and Daphne starts teaching Niles how to dance a tango, he accidentally bursts out that he \"adores\" her. Daphne says that she adores him too, which shocks and pleases Niles as they continue to dance. When the dance is over, Niles realizes that Daphne thought that he was just acting to try to impress everyone in the room, which hurts Niles. Out of the blue, an attractive former associate of Niles' walks up to him, giving him a card and telling him that if he would ever like to take her dancing, all he need do is call. At first, Niles decides not to accept her proposal, but as he leaves with Daphne, he turns around and takes the card with him. Note: This is the first episode of the series directed by Kelsey Grammer. Frasier's diminished role and screen time were to give Grammer more room to focus on directing. He would go on to direct dozens more episodes in the later seasons.",

Frasier feels guilt over the damage he caused, although Niles insists that the man would have been expelled sooner or later. The brothers' attempts to contact and reconcile with the man, only to discover that he is a convict. While visiting him, Frasier convinces both himself and the man that his expulsion led directly to his current situation. Frasier also learns that the man possesses a violent temper, and so doesn't tell him the full story of his expulsion. However, his guilt persists, and he decides to assuage it by smoothing over the bully's troubled marriage. Frasier meets with the man's wife, who says that their marital problems are caused by her sexual interest in danger, and then molests Frasier just before her husband arrives. Frasier hides from the violent ex-con in his apartment, then uses his lighter to activate the room's smoke alarm so that he might escape.",
