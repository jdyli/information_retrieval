        "The Monarch attempts to hold Hank and Dean for ransom, but his plan is foiled by the arrival of Monarch's old enemy Captain Sunshine, who takes Hank away before the Monarch's plans can come to fruition. Hank, who is upset at his father and claims he has no father, is recruited by Captain Sunshine to be his new Wonder Boy. Sunshine's butler seems to believe something is up and walks Hank through the motions of being the new Wonder Boy, who seems it odd that Captain Sunshine does not fight crime at night or with his former team. However, he does work as a local news anchor with all of his former teammates. The Monarch still tries to collect the ransom, but Venture easily sees through his attempts to trade off one of his henchmen as Hank, with Dean being the only one still in custody. Venture hatches a plan to get the boys back, by shrinking down Hatred and hiding him in a bag of money Pete White and Billy Quizboy won from a recent lawsuit, but the Monarch manages to take the money anyway. Dr. Mrs. the Monarch warns him that as they do not have Hank, the Monarch will have to return the money according to Guild bylaws, but reveals she has managed to isolate the unique radiation Captain Sunshine gives off and has devised a way to track him down and defeat him. They track Sunshine down to his mansion, just as Venture, Pete White, and Billy do the same, both seeking out Hank, who somehow easily manages to thwart the Monarch's plans. Captain Sunshine rushes home from his news anchor gig to find the Monarch, who he believes to be immune to his powers in Wonder Boy's costume. The Monarch uses the device his wife made to kill Sunshine, but it actually re-energizes him, and he defeats the Monarch. Just as he is about to attack Rusty, Pete, and Billy, Hank stops him and says he cannot be the Wonder Boy he wants him to be, and returns home with his father, but not before asking for a word in with Batman, at which Captain Sunshine kicks him out.",

Dr. Mrs. the Monarch warns the Monarch that 21 may be acting oddly, but the Monarch is pleased with how all of his henchmen are acting under 21's leadership, even the one who is now serving them a fancy dinner. However, 21 decides to kidnap Hank and Dean, ultimately being successful after the two have become tired of Sergeant Hatred's various kidnapping drills. Just as the Monarch and Dr. Mrs. the Monarch prepare to sleep, the Monarch suddenly has a violent reaction to what they had for dinner, and his face swells up. Dr. Mrs. the Monarch also gets a call from Sergeant Hatred who believes that 21 has kidnapped the boys while Dr. Mrs. the Monarch plans on dealing with the problem herself. Venture and Hatred infiltrate Malice to attempt a rescue on their own, while 21 tries to interrogate the boys, who reveal they know nothing of what happened to 24 and are simply annoyed by the predicament. 21 lets them go, and they catch a cab home with help from the Monarch. On their way to save the boys, Hatred and Venture pass by Hatred's old home only to find Princess Tinyfeet engaging in S&M play with Private Schwa, among Hatred's other former henchmen. With Hatred overcome with grief, Venture finds Dr. Mrs. the Monarch, and the two reminisce over the various inhabitants of Malice, until she asks if he ever tried calling the boys, much to his chagrin. Hank reveals the two made their way home safely, and he leaves to find Hatred. The Monarch, having been kicked out of his Cocoon's bar for his anaphalactic face, finds 21 lamenting 24's death, before reprimanding him for kidnapping the Venture boys. Back in his room, a hand crosses out the Venture Bros.' name off the list of those responsible for 24's death, when 21 returns to find 24's skull has moved on its own accord.",

However, 21 decides to kidnap Hank and Dean, ultimately being successful after the two have become tired of Sergeant Hatred's various kidnapping drills. Just as the Monarch and Dr. Mrs. the Monarch prepare to sleep, the Monarch suddenly has a violent reaction to what they had for dinner, and his face swells up. Dr. Mrs. the Monarch also gets a call from Sergeant Hatred who believes that 21 has kidnapped the boys while Dr. Mrs. the Monarch plans on dealing with the problem herself. Venture and Hatred infiltrate Malice to attempt a rescue on their own, while 21 tries to interrogate the boys, who reveal they know nothing of what happened to 24 and are simply annoyed by the predicament. 21 lets them go, and they catch a cab home with help from the Monarch. On their way to save the boys, Hatred and Venture pass by Hatred's old home only to find Princess Tinyfeet engaging in S&M play with Private Schwa, among Hatred's other former henchmen. With Hatred overcome with grief, Venture finds Dr. Mrs. the Monarch, and the two reminisce over the various inhabitants of Malice, until she asks if he ever tried calling the boys, much to his chagrin. Hank reveals the two made their way home safely, and he leaves to find Hatred. The Monarch, having been kicked out of his Cocoon's bar for his anaphalactic face, finds 21 lamenting 24's death, before reprimanding him for kidnapping the Venture boys. Back in his room, a hand crosses out the Venture Bros.' name off the list of those responsible for 24's death, when 21 returns to find 24's skull has moved on its own accord."

The Order is unable to defeat the beast, until the Outrider appears and saves them. Dr. Orpheus is determined to figure out how the Outrider, the man who stole his wife, is able to pass into the Second World, while Jefferson complains that he is the only one of their group who has no magical ability. When the Outrider is attacked by Torrid once more, Orpheus finds that he must have taken a shortcut into the Second World and calls on Billy to help them find out why. Billy discovers a magical artifact in the Outrider's skull, and removes it, trapping Orpheus, the Alchemist, and Billy in the Second World with the Outrider. However, Jefferson has apparently developed the ability to be between worlds, and helps the men return to the physical world.

At the end, Triana leaves the compound, in a way not to break Dean's heart, and Orpheus realizes why his wife left him in the first place.",

        "The world's super-scientists and super-villains sidekicks have all been kidnapped by a strange force calling himself Zeus. Zeus, with the help of his subordinate Zero, begins a series of battles between the kidnapped men, which include 21, Pete White, Billy, and Captain Sunshine's butler Desmond. However, 21 begins to suspect something is up. The remaining members of OSI, SPHINX, the Guild of Calamitous Intent, the newly formed Revenge Society, and other independent villains convene in a secret think tank to solve the mystery of Zeus, who they soon believe is some super-powered being with light-based powers. Dragoon reveals that the man has to be Captain Sunshine, his former archenemy, but not the current one but rather Desmond, who served as the previous Captain Sunshine.

        "Billy Quizboy has begun work at a hospital under the name Dr. Phil Donahue where he is lauded as a skilled surgeon, but he lacks the credentials he claims he had. In a worry, he enters a patient's room to find the ailing King Gorilla seemingly killed by the mysterious benefactors who had previously given Conjectural Technologies a substantial payment. Billy returns home worried and saying they need to return the money, but Pete White reassures him until these mysterious benefactors come and kidnap Billy. Pete goes to SPHINX for help, when SPHINX realizes that they were contacted by the Investors, a mysterious group who has killed everyone else they have come in contact with. Brock and Shore Leave track down the Investors' location to the middle of the Atlantic Ocean, and get help from the former pirate Captain in his boat to get them to the location, as J.J. has used parts from the X-2 to build Gargantua 2. Billy finds himself with Monstroso, who has also made a deal with the Investors, and Billy is to become immortal as a result of his own deal. Billy believes he is going to become a vampire, and later that night is seduced by a group of who he believes to be vampires, while Shore Leave locks onto Billy's location and they all discover Monstroso is related to the Investors as well. The following day, Billy is informed that he simply slept with prostitutes, and Monstroso says that his immortality will be becoming a world renowned surgeon for performing a life-saving heart transplant on Monstroso using King Gorilla's heart while also receiving the necessary credentials to work as an actual surgeon. Brock and Shore Leave find Monstroso's boat and the Investors, but their individual attacks just phase right through the men. Brock then tracks down Monstroso to find Billy operating, keeping Brock from killing his patient. Later, Monstroso is in recovery, but has been brought to SPHINX headquarters, where Brock asks if he is ready to be killed yet.",

Back in the present, the two are united as an official villainous Duo by the Guild of Calamitous Intent, while Tim-Tom and Kevin, Dr. Girlfriend's previous henchmen as Lady Au Pair, alongside Brock repair the Cocoon, all while attacking Henchmen 21 and 24. The married couple move into Phantom Limb's former estate while Phantom Limb, revealed to be alive, murders the real Manotaur."

All hope seems lost until Dr. Henry Killinger arrives to restore the business to its former glory, hiring a series of workers for Dr. Venture known as the Venchmen, performing a hostile takeover of Conjectural Industries, dealing with Dr. Venture's debtors, and evicting Dr. Orpheus for plans to reopen the arachnid studies wing.

Dr. Venture, believing himself a mentor and friend to \"Teddy\", grows worried when the calls stop. Concerned for \"Teddy\", Dr. Venture and Sgt. Hatred set out to rescue him.

        "After having his identity revealed by Monstroso, Councilman #4 turns up dead. Spying at his funeral, OSI discovers a lead on Councilman #1, a cyborg villain named Vendata, and make plans to use Captain Sunshine's old ally Ghost Robot and one of Vendata's personal ads to spy on the Council of Thirteen. Phineas Phage is sworn in as the new Councilman #4, and all the Councilmen sans Vendata decide to go to a party at a Guild-linked nightclub. Ghost Robot's undercover date with Vendata ultimately leads him to the same club, forcing Brock and Shore Leave to disguise themselves as villains to enter as well. Vendata ditches Ghost Robot at the club, leaving Brock to pick him up. Meanwhile, Rusty and Billy tail Brock, having suspected he went to a costume party, and are captured by the Guild. As they attempt to flee with Ghost Robot, Brock is forced to turn back to try and save Rusty and Billy from a torture game, aided by Shore Leave cutting down the club's disco ball. Rusty is saved, however, when the Monarch and Dr. Mrs. the Monarch show up and invoke Guild law. The club empties out, leaving the Monarch and Rusty alone together, but before the Monarch can do anything the disco ball falls and seemingly kills Dr. Venture. For her service to the Guild, the Sovereign offers Dr. Mrs. the Monarch the chance to replace Vendata (who Brock accidentally killed) as Councilman #1, but she asks for more time to consider. Meanwhile, the members of the Revenge Society are watching the proceedings via a secret spy feed with Dr. Henry Killinger.",

The walkers inside the prison proliferate as the inhabitants evacuate the primary cell block, although the walkers, including Patrick, are quickly killed by the rest of the survivors. Carol takes care of a man, Ryan Samuels, whose children are Lizzie and Mika, and he realizes he has been bitten in the arm and neck. Ryan, coming to terms with his imminent death, asks Carol to take care of his children, while Carol decides to bring his children to him to say goodbye. She comforts the girls and encourages them to stay strong. Rick and Daryl discover that Patrick has been killed by an aggressive flu strain that causes the infected person to choke on his own blood. The survivors decide to quarantine those who might be infected to prevent the virus from spreading. The outer fence of the prison is about to give way to the walkers, and the group tries to hold off the undead, discovering the rats in the process. Rick drives out the walkers by reluctantly feeding them his pigs, which are deemed to be possible hosts for the new virus. As Rick scraps his pig pen, Carl discloses to his father that Carol has been teaching the children how to use weapons. Rick gives Carl back his gun, disappointed that his attempt to live a quiet life has failed. Tyreese visits his girlfriend, Karen, who had been infected; he is horrified when he discovers two burnt bodies, one of them Karen's.",

        "The unknown virus continues to spread, killing more people and infecting others, including Sasha, Glenn and Lizzie. Tyreese is furious about Karen's death, and attacks Daryl and Rick in frustration, causing the latter to fight back. Hershel suggests that the group search a nearby veterinary college to find medication to help the infected. He also decides that the children, including Carl, must be separated from the other survivors, as they are more vulnerable to the disease. Hershel leaves to go into the woods to search for herbs and berries and runs into Carl, who insists he must accompany him. They encounter harmless walkers during their trip, so Carl decides to shoot them, but he is discouraged by Hershel. Maggie cries about Glenn's illness, but Beth reminds her that they all have jobs to do. Carol breaks down after offering condolences to Tyreese. Hershel decides to risk exposure by caring for the sick. He says that they are always risking their lives, and the only thing they could do now is to decide what they are risking it for. Daryl, Michonne, Bob and Tyreese decide to head to the college to retrieve the medication, but on their way, they hear a voice on their radio speaking about \"sanctuary\". They suddenly encounter a massive herd of walkers, forcing them to abandon their vehicle, although a bitter Tyreese stays in the car. When he decides to get out, he is surrounded by the undead, forcing the remaining three to leave him and head out into the woods. Tyreese miraculously survives the herd's attack and catches up with Daryl's group. After investigating the murder of Karen and David, Rick confronts Carol, who admits that she killed them.",

Tyreese intentionally lets himself be overtaken by a walker, but he is saved by Daryl and Bob. Rick takes Carol along on a supply run and they come upon a house where they discover two survivors, a couple named Sam and Ana. After Carol patches Sam's wounds, the two request to join them at the prison, despite the viral outbreak. Rick decides to let them join, telling them to stay put until Carol and he finish. When the two offer to help scrounge supplies, Carol suggests they do so against Rick's protests. Rick gives them both guns as well as his watch to know what time to meet back up. Daryl and the others get a car working and head off to the college again. Bob tells Daryl alone about his alcoholism and his fault behind Zach's earlier death in the store. At the college, Bob is almost killed trying to protect his bag which contains only alcohol that he found at the college and no medical supplies. Daryl almost beats Bob, but simply threatens him. Carol and Rick find Ana's body being eaten by walkers. Sam never shows back up. When preparing to leave, Rick tells Carol that she cannot come back to the prison because Tyreese will kill her, the others will not agree with her decisions, and that she took matters into her own hands that she did not have the right to do so with.
