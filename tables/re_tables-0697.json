As Jane notices the victim's toenails are painted with her own blood, one by one the team looks up to see skywriting form Red John's signature smiley face. Emma's twin sister Maya is still missing, and the investigation begins at the Plaskett home. Jane does not think the girls were random targets, but something more personal, while Lisbon thinks this case is a trap that Red John has set for Jane. Rigsby and Cho track the skywriting transaction to a dummy corporation's P.O. Box and find a letter that leads them to the sender, Rosalind Harker. Rosalind a blind woman, had a relationship with Red John, and can only give a description of Red John based on her other senses. She does help shed some light on Red John's friend Dumar. Checking out a lead on a farm property linked to Red John, Jane is held at gunpoint by Sheriff Hardy, a.k.a. Dumar. Lisbon rescues Jane but Red John escapes still one step ahead of them. In the aftermath, Sheriff Hardy frees himself from handcuffs and tries to shoot Lisbon but is stopped by a shotgun blast at the hands of Jane.",

        "The camp hosts parents' weekend, but Will's parents are no-shows. Alistair puts on a charade of being Becca's boyfriend and invites Becca to dinner with his family. Trent is afraid to tell his parents that he is dating Chloe, and Amber's mother smuggles in cookies, which Amber later hides in the laundry room. Ian is caught off-guard by his parents being nice to each other for once; he is then told that they are getting a divorce. Ian finds the cookies that Amber hid and gives them to Dr. Rand. Still feeling guilty about sleeping with Jonathan, Dr. Rand thinks about eating the cookies herself, but then finally gives them to Wayne.

Salty has to leave to take care of his other daughter, 15-year-old Violet, whom Dr. Rand did not know about. She gets upset, thinking he has abandoned her again. Trent has a hard time with his stepmother's being around, and Chloe is hurt that his parents don't know about her. Will, Ian, and Trent play a song for everyone, and Trent finally kisses Chloe afterwards to show his parents who his girlfriend is. Alistair tells Piznarski that he is not dwelling on the prank.

Ian follows her; they talk, kiss, and show up to the campfire holding hands, which breaks Will's and George's hearts. The episode ends with Will and Dr. Rand having a conversation about Dr. Rand's reward from losing weight: hating herself a little less than before.",

        "Bored with everyday life, the King cousins decide to create their own newspaper. This helps to keep them entertained and goes quite well, until the children's \"made up\" advice column (Madame X) gets mixed up with the Avonlea Chronicles' real news. Olivia, working as a reporter for the Chronicle, and temporarily acting as editor, is hard put to defend herself for the column mix-up. Then the Chronicle office is robbed and it is up to Jasper Dale to catch the thief and exonerate Olivia."

An investigation begins, and when Patrick recognizes a link between a recent murder the team was investigating and Red John, the team hurriedly arrives at the workplace of the victim\u2014and find the third member of Bosco's team dead, murdered by Red John. With Red John revealed as being behind the attack, it is found to have been orchestrated as Bosco had come close to finding the infamous serial killer while investigating the discovery of the missing body of a Red John victim; the body had been removed and hidden due to forensic evidence left by Red John himself. However, the team arrives too late to recover the victim's body, as someone impersonating a CBI agent picked up the body, and later destroyed all of the evidence relating to the case. It is found that the person who recovered the evidence was Bosco's secretary, Rebecca, who was also the assailant who shot Bosco and his team. Lisbon arrives at Bosco's hospital room to apprehend her just before she finishes him off. Before Bosco dies, he declares his love to Lisbon and wishes Patrick luck in finding Red John. Patrick interrogates Rebecca, demanding why she killed Bosco and his team.
