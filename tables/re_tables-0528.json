Later, Reiji confides to Lizzie that the sniping occurred after Randy Weber was killed, which means it wasn't part of Isaac's plan. Reiji plants the money that Cal stole at Wisemel's mansion to implicate him further in his treachery. If Wisemel was the one responsible for Judy's death and the crime spree then the money would belong to him. At the apartment Cal offers to help Reiji in his assassinations but he doesn't want her to get involved any further but Cal still wants to help Reiji, as she feels isolated as Reiji is alone in this assassin lifestyle. Reiji explains to Cal that he hates himself for becoming an assassin and that he can't stop killing no matter what he does in this life since as he exists as a part of phantom Zwei. He angrily tells her off. He explains to her that if he wasn't in the world of the living all the people that Zwei killed and in extension him would still be alive. During the conversation with Cal she asks why he kills, if not for duty or anything else what was the reason. Cal realizes that he wasn't killing because he wants to but because he has too it was his karma, he has a higher purpose setup for him by God but Cal doesn't want to be separated from him and wants to be together with him, crying he explains that he wanted to return. When he says return he means to go back to a world of happiness, joy and love. A world where he can truly be together with Cal and he finally says to God to let him go to Cal's world when he dies and is finally free of Zwei.

When Cal saw the apartment in flames she rushed to it knowing that Reiji has not come home yet and if he sees the apartment in flames he will take Cal for dead and not come back that's why she scream out his name.

One day, Reiji is dragged by one of his classmates, Sanae, to meet her friend Mio Fujieda, who attempts to confess her feelings for him. After a conversation, both of them agree to go on a date. During their date, Reiji and Mio encounter a biker who does a harmless sneak attack. Reiji goes to a church where Eren is praying. Reiji explains the situation to her, that Inferno has found them. They have a discussion where Eren reveals that during her time with Scythe master he investigated the Godo Clan to use them for his own ends, Mio's real surname is actually Godo, which means she belongs to the Yakuza family, the Godo clan and that she was Daisuke's half sister, they were both from different mother's and because the Godo clan is very important to Inferno and to Shiga the new leader and the one who killed Daisuke, Mio will become a vital trump card for the battle against Inferno. Eren's intention is to be Mio's friend so that she can use her as leverage and encourages Reiji to do the same if the Godo clan and Inferno ever catch up to them. Reiji had become saddened that everything has come back to the way it was but Eren comforts him, she also mentions that he still hadn't remembered something that had made him even more depressed, this something was Cal but Eren was happy because he forgot since he is happier that way. The pair begin to make plans for their escape. The next day, Reiji goes home from school and encounters the biker again, who produces a familiar pocket watch and plays its tune. To his shock, Reiji instantly recognizes the tune. The biker then reveals herself to be Cal Devens.",

Lizzie notices Drei has disappeared along with some weapons, although Scythe Master doesn't seem too unhappy with that, she goes to look for her. During her search, Lizzie's memories from Drei's (Cal's) training are shown. Lizzie feels obligated to protect Cal, as she is young and being manipulated by Scythe. While on a date, Reiji tells Mio that he is glad that the girl who punched him (Cal/Drei) is still alive, although he doesn't reveal any of the story to her. As Mio gets back home from the date, she is approached by Drei. Drei goes against Inferno and forces Mio to get on her bike at gunpoint, and is soon stopped by Lizzie. During their conversation, Drei mentions her intent to kill Mio so that the bosses can ignore her safety and allow Drei to kill Zwei. Lizzie points her gun at Drei and says she cannot let civilians die, and that both she and Zwei never wanted Cal to become an assassin. Cal gives Lizzie a chance to shoot her while the music from her watch is playing. Lizzie remembers Claudia and Romero and the young Cal, and refuses to shoot. When the music is over Cal pulls out her gun, shoots her, and leaves her to die. As she lays there dying, she feels that the burden of killing was too heavy to bear. Drei takes Mio to an abandoned house, where she plans to keep her for the next few days.
