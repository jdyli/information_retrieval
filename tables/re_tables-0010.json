He and Barney are able to find the true thieves down on the docks, based upon the strong clue that one of them keeps repeating, \"Yeah, yeah: I'm hip, I'm hip!\".

During a picnic scavenger hunt (which he wasn't invited to) he forges a plan to find the old Night Master's Amnesulet to make Grizzleflayvin forget the old Night Master. The Ultimoose will gain all of the Night Master's powers. Meanwhile, Yang wakes up and has a lousy day. Although Master Yo tells him it's not wise to walk around grumpy, Yang is too angry to listen.

He tries to get her into a \"clam wedding.\" Yin refuses to tell him she's using him and goes anyway. But Yin refuses to marry Clamuel, and he turns into a large clam monster. Yin discovers that the beast is unbeatable, so she accepts the marriage proposal. When Yin kisses him, he becomes a \"hot\" clam-boy. About an hour later, they return to the clam-cave, and Clamuel kicks Yin out. Yang explains how an hour is about 100 clam years. Antagonist: Clamuel's Clam Monster Zarnot's Girlfriend: Zarnot is out to get Yang for the times he has been stuffed into his old toy box. But every time he fires missiles or his laser, he misses Yang and hits Lena or something else that causes a chain reaction. Zarnot doesn't know why Yang isn't fighting back until he finds out that Yang is dating Lena. In order to understand Yang's new way, Zarnot builds a girlfriend for himself. The girlfriend is built with the same emotions and attitude as Lena. When Zarnot spends the day with his new girlfriend, he now knows how to defeat Yang and leaves his girlfriend to fight Yang. When the girlfriend feels hurt from being dumped, she goes after Zarnot to destroy him. Antagonist: Zarnot, Girlbotica",

The main purpose of the software is to provide a parallelization engine common to all algorithms through the 'generalized island model'. Initially developed within the European Space Agency, the code was intended to help the automated design of interplanetary trajectories and spacecraft transfers in general. The user can implement his own problem and algorithm both in C++ and in Python."

The hospital sequence is extremely funny, beginning with the arrival of a bespectacled Viennese specialist, Dr. Schliprock, whom Fred and Barney lead into a broom closet so that Fred can take his place. Fred's \"operation\" on Barney principally takes the form of applying a wrench to his nose and twisting with all his might, after which the patient's body temperature is, incredibly, normal. After finally escaping from the hospital, it's discovered that the ball game was actually scheduled for that evening \u2013 not that afternoon, as the guys had thought \u2013 and that Barney's boss had tickets for Fred and Barney to go. But because Barney was \"sick,\" he gave the tickets away to someone else.",
