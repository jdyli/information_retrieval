J.T., sensing a huge windfall about to come his way, agrees to go along with the new producer's suggestions (including firing his siblings), and begins neglecting his schoolwork and speaking freely to his parents. In the end, J.T.'s dreams of success are ruined when the producers hire actors to play both J.T. and sidekick Cody. A humbled J.T. starts focusing on his school work, and apologizes to his dad.

        "Carol sets up Karen with Freddy, who is a 142 on Karen's grading scale. Karen, however, prefers Jeffrey (a 195). Despite disappointing Carol, Karen accepts a date with Jeffrey and dumps Freddy by lying to him. She sneaks out of the house to go with Jeff and they win Perfect Couple right after Freddy confronts Karen. She refuses the award and finishes the evening with Freddy. Meanwhile, Carol does not like the way Frank organizes his money. She tries to make him use a male purse, but he refuses. He concentrates his efforts on putting an alarm on Lucille because Cody had his stereo stolen out of it. The alarm was so good Frank got stuck in the van demonstrating it. Note: Brandon Call is not in this episode, except for an additional scene.",

        "On Halloween, J.T. and his sisters host a costume party at a decrepit old mansion. During the party, it becomes obvious that J.T. and Sam aren't getting along, and, after a mix-up involving their costumes (they are forced to go tandem as a horse), she decides to dance with someone else. J.T. fumes about his predicament, and he later meets Abby, the ghostly 19-year-old inhabitant of the mansion, who committed suicide after a bad break-up many years back.

Carol and Frank devise a plan to date and then get married, so the kids don't find out about them getting married in Jamaica. They plan a barbecue at the Fosters' home.

The two formerly-separate families try their best to deal with the uncomfortable situation, but can't get along. The next day, Al tells her dad that her stomach hurts, thinking it is a ploy to skip school, Frank tell her she has to go to school, but Carol believes Al, and takes her to the doctor.
