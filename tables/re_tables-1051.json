A simple change in colours can affect the sales of a product immediately, or a certain colour can make us seem more desirable to the opposite sex.

        "Ant and Dec hosted all the latest action from the jungle. Hugo faced the latest trial, Savage Sewer. In this trial, Hugo had to go into a sewer (filled with various animals) to obtain stars. He got nine out of a possible eleven, which he was pleased with. All the celebrities face the eviction challenge - Bed Bugs. This trial (also done last year) involved trying to spend a whole night in a glass coffin. There was time added to each pair for the challenges as well, with 60minutes being added to one pairs time and zero minutes being added to two pairs time. Though with no challenge bonus, Rosemary lasted the longest, lasting nearly three hours, but unlike last year, no-one stayed the whole night in the coffin. It was announced that the top five (immune) celebrities were Limahl, Hugo, Rosemary, Ashley and Linda, which meant Charlie, Colin, David, Eric, Helen and Nadine, were facing the vote-off. There was also a challenge involving bells, in which each celebrity had a bell to ring in a certain order of a song. If they guessed correctly, they would win a meal.

This trial (also done last year) involved trying to spend a whole night in a glass coffin. There was time added to each pair for the challenges as well, with 60minutes being added to one pairs time and zero minutes being added to two pairs time.

The trial consisted of getting stars from various parts of a train, filled with different animals and fish guts. She got eight out of a possible ten stars and was overjoyed. The 'Dingo Dollars Challenge' also returned. Eric and Hugo took part and the challenge was to listen to various vinyl records and hear a number at the end which would open a lock. They won and chose the prize of ice lollies. The celebrities answered the question correctly and won the prize.

The trial was to get into a plane and fly to other planes, collecting stars from the wings and in the air. As everyone expected, David got nine out of nine stars, and was pleased. The 'Dingo Dollars Challenge' this time was faced by Helen and Charlie. They had to pump a balloon in a plastic frogs mouth until it exploded.

The trial (named Drown and Out) involved staying in a glass cabin with rising water, unscrewing pipes unleashing creatures to find stars. Though he found it hard (due to his phobia of spiders) he won all eight stars, and was very happy. Ashley and David were sent to Snake Rock for an announcement, and were set as 'Camp Meddlers' (like Anthony & Dougie being Camp Traitors last year). They were set to do a series of tasks, such as persuade Helen, who never did laundry, to do laundry and hiding the mirror. The final (and hardest) one was Ashley waking up in the middle of the night claiming to see a monster, with David backing her up. Also, she had to swap beds with someone (of which she chose Hugo, who didn't mind). In the end, Colin and Eric were announced as the bottom two, and it was announced they would have to take part in a trial to see who would go home.",

We look at his boldness as a marketer, how and where it first showed itself in his early 20s, his offer to pay for the Super Bowl ad time when the Apple board hated the famous \"1984\" Mac launch TV ad, his vindication when \"1984\" was cited as maybe the best TV ad of all time, his eventual ouster from Apple only one year later, and his return in 1997 - when he commissioned the bold \"Think Different\" ad campaign while, unbeknownst to most, Apple was just weeks away from bankruptcy.

But that bravado pays off as Jobs inspires his company and releases the iMac, the iPod, iTunes, the Apple retail stores all in the same year. Then Jobs hits his stride and releases not only the iTunes store but the iconic iPhone, and with it, some of the most effective advertising the industry has even seen. His marketing instincts and his courage further propels Apple to even greater heights with the iPad.

        "Ant and Dec presented the latest action. The celebrities this time picked David to do the trial, as he and Ashley were the only people that wanted to do it. They thought that she may have a disadvantage as she is scared of the dark, and the trial had parts where the celebrity had to be in the dark. The trial (named Cruelty Towers) has already appeared in the show this series in Episode 4, but the celebrity that took part in it (Helen) gave up on the trial within 10seconds. The trial consisted of going through rooms in hotels (containing creatures) to find stars. David managed to achieve 6 stars out of a possible 7, just failing to find the star in the last room. Helen and Ashley took part in the \"Dingo Dollar Challenge\". Where they had to sit on toad stalls (whilst dressed as gnomes). One of them had to collect 50 inflatable fish with their fishing rod whilst the other had to hold the lobster cage containing the \"Dingo Dollars\". They did collect 50 fish but when the cage opened the \"Dingo Dollars\" fell into the gunge that the fish had been in, so they had to search around for the bag, and eventually they did find them. In this episode we did not see them go to the outback shack but Ant and Dec did tell us that they received salt and pepper. For dinner they received Kangaroo tail much to the dislike of Eric. There was also a dispute between Rosemary and Hugo, after Rosemary felt that Hugo was being disrespectful. In the end, Hugo and Helen were announced as the bottom two and it was then announced that Helen would leave the jungle. In her post-exit interview Helen said that this experience had really changed her life, and that she wanted David to win.",

The team that won were Croc Creek. Then Dec and Ant announced the first Bushtucker Trial - Special Delivery, in which a celebrity from each team had to search for stars in a parcel shaped box by putting their hands into different compartments. David Haye won the trial against Hugo Taylor. The rest of the celebrities, not facing the trial, also had to make their way into camp. Croc Creek had to travel across a bridge with 'bits meeting' over a huge open space, while Snake Rock had to canoe along the river in quick time. All celebrities made it to the camp, although Helen Flanagan (Croc Creek) struggled due to her fear of heights. Hugo also raised some attention, quoting \"I would expect my MP to be doing her job; not coming into the jungle\". This was an issue that had been widely talked about in the press.

It was time for Helen (Croc Creek) and Nadine (Snake Rock) to face the first public voted bushtucker trial - Bug Burial. The trial entailed surviving 10minutes underground with jungle creatures in a locked coffin, before escaping to win food. Helen managed only 10seconds and therefore did not gain food for Croc Creek. While lasting longer, Nadine only managed four minutes and therefore also gained no food for Snake Rock - meaning both camps were going to have to survive on basic rations of rice and beans for the next 24hours. It was then time for a change to the celebrity chest challenge (the same format but now was named 'Dingo Dollar Challenges'. This challenge was between Brian (Croc Creek) and Eric (Snake Rock). Both celebrities had to stand on a lilypad afloat in the middle of a river and try and catch tennis balls which were shot at them with a net. Brian won the challenge and Crock Creek got the question right - and won five hammocks as their treat. As the night drew in, with only basic rations, tensions grew in both camps as the realization of how hard the jungle is was starting to set in. Ant and Dec then went into camp to reveal who the public had voted to face the next Bushtucker trial - Rotten Rhymes. It was announced that Helen was facing the trial for Croc Creek and Nadine for Snake Rock.",

It was time for Helen (Croc Creek) and Nadine (Snake Rock) to face the first public voted bushtucker trial - Bug Burial. The trial entailed surviving 10minutes underground with jungle creatures in a locked coffin, before escaping to win food. Helen managed only 10seconds and therefore did not gain food for Croc Creek. While lasting longer, Nadine only managed four minutes and therefore also gained no food for Snake Rock - meaning both camps were going to have to survive on basic rations of rice and beans for the next 24hours.

        "Ant and Dec hosted the latest action from the jungle. Helen and Nadine go head-to-head in the latest bushtucker trial - Rotten Rhymes. For the first time, the two celebrities that did the first trial were voted to do another. The trial involved eating a selection of 'jungle foods'. Nadine managed to get four star, whereas Helen managed only three. Though she had lost, Helen felt pleased, as this was a vast improvement on the previous trial. Snake Rock were very pleased with Nadine's victory. When they returned, David and Hugo did the Dingo Dollar Challenge. This challenge involved placing blocks in a wall and then climbing up the wall, to win the challenge. David won and asked for crisps (over a toilet seat and air freshener). However, the celebrities incorrectly answered the question, so won nothing. The celebrities then found out that both camps were going to have to merge into Croc Creek. When they merged, there was mixed feelings at first, but then all the celebrities started to get along.

After much encouraging from Ant, Dec and the crew, she decided to try, but immediately stopped and bailed out as soon as the klaxon sounded, therefore winning no meals for camp. There was also a talent show, with Rosemary and Limahl as the judges. The celebrities were paired up and each given a talent and the top four pairs would go to the jungle pub.
