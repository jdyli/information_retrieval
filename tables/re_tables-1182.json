He also informed her that someone knew about the discovery of the Scarab of Sword. The news surprised her because she had not announced the discovery nor conducted an experiment. She eagerly wanted to speak with Methos in jail. Flashback to the ancient Egypt, Methos was shown around Pharaoh Djer's Kingdom and Palace, and the Pharaoh informed him that he would be the heir to the throne. He chose Methos because he had a premonition and a repetitive dream about an Immortal stranger coming from the desert who would be the next heir to the throne. As an Immortal, Pharaoh Djer could not father children, thus he waited for years for the stranger to come. Djer had become bored and was tired of being the ruler of Upper and Lower Egypt. He wanted to retire and even offered his head to Methos when the time came so Methos would rule the kingdom with undeniable power. Methos did not even think about the offer; he could only think about avenging the death of his nomad wife and the people he had commanded. But he did not say anything or take any action; he bided his time. Methos was so blinded with revenge. \"I yearned to pierce his body with a thousand swords and shove his reputation down his blood-choked throat. But of necessity, I held my tongue to bite with better venom.\""

When the Heroine returns to work, she learns that a trip into the forest is scheduled. The date matches the trip when she fell from the cliff, but only Ikki's fan club is going on the trip this time. The Heroine gets a call at home from Ikki, but he is drunk, and he expresses his distaste for his fangirls, except for the Heroine. The Heroine goes on the trip into the forest with the fan club. When they are alone, Ikki tells her that when he was younger, he wished on a falling star that girls would fall in love with him, and it came true: any girl who looks into his eyes falls for him instantly. But over time he has come to despise the superficial levels of affection he receives.

        "The Heroine suddenly appears outside her apartment, and she receives a text message from Kent, who says to meet up with him at the cafe (also realizing that she's back to August 1st). After sitting there for a while, Kent asks her what exactly was wrong with his attitude that she disagreed against. The Heroine has no idea what he's talking about, so she plays around the conversation by apologizing. They take a walk along the train station, for no apparent reason. Kent simply says that he had \"researched\" with a friend and found that this is what couples do during dates. She goes home and looks through her text messages. Kent only messages her saying \"Good Night\" or \"Good Morning.\" Suddenly, the Heroine gets a text from Kent telling her to stop by at his workplace later. After sitting there for a couple of hours, she asks Kent about the reason he called her. He is surprised and says that its because she is always wanting to spend more time with him. Later in the episode, the Heroine is seen standing at the train station in a yukata waiting for Kent. After a while, she texts Kent because he is late and he calls, saying that he had totally forgotten about it because he was \"uninterested\" in the festival and tells her to wait. He arrives, after running from his work place, and it is now raining. They both walk to the festival under Kent's umbrella and she learns that they had a promise when they started dating, which was to simply go to the temple festival together. They continue playing at the festival and Kent later says that \"Today was fun.\" It skips forward and they are seen at Kent's workplace. Kent asks about his coffee, which turns out to be a trick because he had logically figured out that she had lost her memories. Orion suddenly appears and the Heroine gets distracted, which catches Kent's attention. The Heroine describes the circumstances to Kent, meanwhile drawing a poorly drawn picture of Orion. Kent tries conversing with Orion through the Heroine. When he stops to think (with a sad look, according to the Heroine), Orion disappears. Kent is disappointed, but walks the Heroine home. Kent holds on to the Heroine's hand, saying \"I'll see you tomorrow?\" The Heroine says yes, but as they cross the street, a man bumps into her and she lets go of his hand. After a few moments, she is suddenly walking across a street in the broad daylight during a red light and her hand is grabbed by someone. \"What are you spacing out for?\" a voice says. She turns around and sees Toma grabbing her hand.",

He says that he will try to help her make it to August 25th, but can't say why. The Heroine wonders if he can see the future and he whispers softly, \"Because I experienced it.\" At home, the Heroine and Orion ponder over these strange words.

The Heroine goes to work the next day, where Waka-san is complaining about the water flooding the cafe and how he had to clean all of it up.

However, the good Ukyo cuts himself and goes back to normal. He catches the Heroine and they end up panting besides the well. He tells her to stay away from him. However, Ukyo continues sending her messages to help her avoid danger. The Heroine calls him and Ukyo tells her that the 25th of August is when the world will try its very best to kill her. He commands her to not take a single step out of the house. Then, he tells her that once he hangs up, to never trust him again, and tells her that he will always love her. Then, he hangs up. The next day, it's raining outside and the Heroine gets a message that hints that Ukyo is going to die at the University. She runs outside, despite his warning from yesterday's phone call, and goes to the University. She finds Ukyo, and once again, it's the evil personality and he has a knife at hand.

They start walking home, and Orion tells the Heroine to ask Ukyo about what he meant when he said, \"This world is trying to kill you.\" He tells her that there are many dangers in this world and tells her never to go to the well at the old shrine nearby and Ukyo suddenly crouches in fear, hinting that he had almost died once falling in. He says that he will try to help her make it to August 25th, but can't say why. The Heroine wonders if he can see the future and he whispers softly, \"Because I experienced it.\" At home, the Heroine and Orion ponder over these strange words. It turns back to Ukyo and his split personalities waver over whether or not to continue protecting the Heroine. The Heroine goes to work the next day, where Waka-san is complaining about the water flooding the cafe and how he had to clean all of it up. The Heroine leaves and remarks that Waka-san looks very tired. They find Ukyo sleeping, which turns out to be the evil personality, and he grabs her, telling her that she's the one who should be dead, not him. Luckily, good Ukyo wakes up and lets go, reminding her that he is a danger to her and that she should always be on her guard. Orion realizes that Ukyo has a split personality. It goes to Ukyo, who is surrounded by two robbers. That ends the first part. When the second part continues, the men are on the ground groaning and evil Ukyo is back with the words \"I can't die here now.\" Ukyo calls the Heroine to meet him at the shrine and she goes, where suddenly, it's evil Ukyo and he tries dropping her into the well. However, the good Ukyo cuts himself and goes back to normal. He catches the Heroine and they end up panting besides the well. He tells her to stay away from him. However, Ukyo continues sending her messages to help her avoid danger. The Heroine calls him and Ukyo tells her that the 25th of August is when the world will try its very best to kill her. He commands her to not take a single step out of the house. Then, he tells her that once he hangs up, to never trust him again, and tells her that he will always love her. Then, he hangs up. The next day, it's raining outside and the Heroine gets a message that hints that Ukyo is going to die at the University. She runs outside, despite his warning from yesterday's phone call, and goes to the University. She finds Ukyo, and once again, it's the evil personality and he has a knife at hand. She runs and hides in an auditorium, which soon catches fire from a strike of lightning. Ukyo then traps her in the auditorium and tells the Heroine, \"You can't escape now. Your life is almost over.\" Coming closer, while laughing maniacally, he says, \"This time, I'll kill you with my own hands.\""

        "Continuing from the episode from before, Ukyo, in his bad persona, was on the pursuit of killing the Heroine. He finds her hiding near chairs and tries to stab her but he misses while the Heroine runs to the entrance of the building. Finding it locked, Ukyo catches up to her as he shows her that he had the keys. As he tells her that it was her destiny to die in the building, the window above the doors breaks which makes Ukyo flip to his good side. When good Ukyo notices that he was carrying a knife, he asks the Heroine why she was here. The Heroine explains that it was because of Ukyo's text he sent her from the previous episode that hinted his death. Hearing her reply, good Ukyo figures out that it was his bad persona that sent it to her. Then he began to explain what had happen in this world the first time where the Heroine was actually involved with the explosion in the university mentioned from Episode 10. Ukyo continues on saying that for twenty-five days, the Heroine was unconscious and then on August 25, she died. This event where she died in the fire was actually the first piece of memory the Heroine remembered after she got her amnesia. Since he couldn't accept her death, he traveled to other worlds because he was trying to find her in a world where she was alive which was his wish. Ukyo changes back to evil Ukyo when a lightning bolt strikes the door where the Heroine evades just in time as evil Ukyo says, \"But if you die, I get to live.\" Evil Ukyo goes on saying that whenever he had found her alive in another world, he had never existed in that world to begin with. This explained that since the Heroine was a anomaly in the current world she was in since Ukyo was already there, she was being targeted by the world instead of him. The only reason why she was still alive right now was only because of good Ukyo's warnings since he experienced all of those incidents from the previous worlds. Whenever Ukyo found the Heroine alive in a world, he would always die which he came to the conclusion that there wasn't any world where both of them were alive. Which was why bad Ukyo was going to kill her right now to escape the eternal loop of death. The Heroine gets chased again and stops to another door where she finds it also locked as evil Ukyo tries to kill her once more but misses. Though he missed, bad Ukyo caught her and began to strangle her. However, good Ukyo interrupts him while evil Ukyo tries to continue on suffocating her. At that point, it was revealed by bad Ukyo that Ukyo's bad personality was created from all the pain and hellish experience he faced. Good Ukyo tells him to shut up but bad Ukyo also mentions that he had killed her already many times. Then, good Ukyo admits his murders while saying that it was unforgivable. Then, he tells the Heroine to run away after bad Ukyo says that Neil doesn't have anymore power left to send him to another world meaning that this was his last chance to kill her. As the Heroine runs up the stairs to the top of the clock tower, Orion explains that Neil was the creator of all fairies and how he gained power if he granted wishes to humans. Suddenly bad Ukyo comes and attempts to kill her, when good Ukyo kills himself so the Heroine can live. In his final moments, He confesses his love to her and said he was glad he met her. Then the clock strikes 12. Suddenly Ukyo's body begins to glow bright with the Heroine's. The Heroine somehow ends up in unknown place and Neil and Orion explain everything to her and why she kept on traveling to different worlds. When Orion repeats what Neil says (that he will return to her original world and return her memories), he reveals to her once her memories return, he won't be able to be at her side anymore and she won't remember him. As a white door appears, the Heroine and Orion depart and say their final goodbyes. During the credits all the different versions of the Heroine together with guys in the different worlds the Heroine went to. At the end, she is seen with five cards appearing to her, she smiles and finally returns to her original world.",

Later that day, Tomoko tries to initiate a conversation with Megumi, but runs off after a blustery wind ruins the mood, not staying to hear Megumi's words of praise about her. The episode ends with Tomoko reading the Unpopular Girl definition from the first episode and laughing, thinking none of it matters.",
