        "While traveling through a forest, Van rescues Wendy from being harassed by a thug piloting a small armor, and very shortly afterwards collapses with a high fever. Wendy manages to drag the unconscious Van to a cave and where, in the process of nursing him, she discovers a strange symbol on Van's abdomen. As his fever worsens through the night, she determines that she needs to hurry to the nearest town to get help. She is able to get medicine from a disabled doctor and kind nurse at a private clinic called the Denehee Clinic. While she is gone, Van's fever breaks and though still weak, he manages to summon his armor (which lands an unfortunate distance away forcing him to travel to it) which has the ability to heal him, but at the cost of time spent dreaming about the wedding and his bride's death at the hand of The Claw. Meanwhile, Wendy's hurried return back through the forest is interrupted by a boar which prompts her own remembrance of how she received her brother's gun and how she first met Van. She returns to the cave to find Van gone, and while she is despairing his absence, the thug from earlier returns with friends looking for payback. They are more than willing to take it out on her. Van makes a sudden reappearance, in Dann, just in time to save Wendy from the thugs, and then, without Dann, confronts Wendy about her own disappearance. She tells of trying to take care of him, offering the bag of medicine, then collapses against him. She wakes in the cave next to a cozy fire, surprised to be covered with Van's tuxedo jacket as he stares into the bag of medicine. He tells her again she should go home, and then tells her to go back to sleep, ending the conversation by -- deliberately -- calling her by name and wishing her \"pleasant dreams.\" Back at Denehee Clinic, a knock at the door interrupts the doctor's musing over the drawing Wendy made of Van's mark. At the door is a dangerous looking blonde man in a white coat asking about a man with a clawed hand.",

        "Thieves maroon Van and Wendy on a remote island where a mysterious man of great wealth, named Joe Lutz, welcomes them into his palatial estate until another boat passes the island in ten days. Although the two feel that there is something eerie about him, they have no choice but to accept his hospitality. Joe is nothing but friendly and caring as he makes the two feel at home, offering quiet counsel and using his vast resources to aid them in their quest to track the Claw, giving his guests hope that their stay will not put them too far behind. Even the suspicious Van finds himself coming to appreciate Joe's compassion and opens up about his quest for the claw handed man and the reason. With 'been there, did that' reasoning, Joe tries to convince Van that even if he were to succeed, Van would find his victory hollow and he asks Van if this violent quest would be something Van's wife would condone. Separately Joe has also convinces Wendy that it is obvious The Claw never intended to kill Michael and that she would be wiser to return to Evergreen where Michael would know where to look for her once the Claw releases him. The man is smooth and convincing, and it appears his gentle approach is effectively separating the two seekers and derailing their intent to continue, but after some deep soul searching Van figures out exactly what Joe is doing. Discovered, Joe reveals his true colors, summoning his armor - the Golden Cradle. Van summons his armor and the resulting destruction sends the inhabitants of the island fleeing for their lives. The Golden Cradle is powerful, but Joe hasn't Van's skill and cunning, and Joe is defeated. Kneeling at Dann's feet, Joe offers one last sacrifice to the friend he is working for - The Claw -- and sacrificially detonates his armor, but when the smoke clears, Dann is still standing. Resuming their journey, Van realizes it has just gotten harder - the Claw has friends and he knows Van is coming after him, but his resolve remains unshaken, and when he asks, Wendy remains committed as well.",

Haeta declines Van's request because of her father is now crippled and in poor health, but Findley overhears Van's request and accepts. While Wendy and Joshua stay at Carmen 99's house to spruce up, Van goes with Carmen 99 to her old school where she explains that Findley and her father had been business partners, and that Findley had fostered her after the deaths of her parents.

He runs and tells Carmen, but knowing Van's reaction, orders Joshua not to tell him until she has gathered more information. She goes to Uncle Findley. She finds him collapsed in his lab, and he reveals the flowers are a drug that makes people happy, but it has horrible side effects - inhaling its pollen without the proper antibodies causes debilitating physical side affects, the cause of his poor health and crippling. The Claw supplies them with the medicine, but even with it, long term the pollen still causes problems. He begs Carmen to stop his daughter and destroy the flowers before they destroy the town, and Carmen goes to confront Haeta. Their talk is interrupted by smoke coming from Haeta's house.

Mishka then tauntingly wags his finger at Ave, while he screams in agony, until Ave gives in. Later, the dragon Duran recalls Mishka calling him a \"useless reptile.\" Feeling useless to the Dragonoids, Duran jumps ship, and goes through a lot of city troubles, until a girl named Yuri rescues him, and calls him \"Blackie.\" Later, Hak thinks that he doesn't belong with the chasers anymore, and feels useless to them, so Hak leaves the team. He ends up in the street like a stray cat. Later, Yuri finds him and takes him home. Yuri says she has another pet \"friend\" for him, but the friend is Duran. It is later revealed that both Hak and Duran used to be friends, before the current Dragonoid-Tigeroid War began. However, they quickly become friends again. Soon afterwards, both the Dragonoids and the Tigeroids figure out that their friend is missing, and start to look for them. Jahara leaves the Luftdrake to look for Duran. At Yuri's house both pets fight over trying to get Yuri's attention, thinking if Yuri doesn't like them much, then they will end up on the streets again. Jahara finds them and tries to kill Hak. However, Duran stalls her and defends Hak, until the Chasers could rescue him, while telling Jahara about his friendship with Hak. The Tai Chi Chasers team then shows up, and Finn says that there is a Tai Chi card nearby. However, Yuri has the card, and it is the \"like\" card. After Rai obtains the card, Yuri runs away from both pets, feeling afraid. Then, both the Dragonoid and Tigeroid teams fight after Yuri leaves, and the Chasers win, which allows both \"pets\" go to their right home. For failing to kill Hak, General Mischka decides to punish Jahara, since she did not return with the Tai Chi card, but instead returned with the \"pathetic creature\" (Duran). Mishka coldly attacks Jahara with a powerful Tai Chi blast, which knocks her to the floor in pain. However, this angers Duran, since he believes that Jahara saved his life. Later, Jahara talks to Duran alone, telling him that she likes having him around, even though he is annoying.",

Later, the dragon Duran recalls Mishka calling him a \"useless reptile.\" Feeling useless to the Dragonoids, Duran jumps ship, and goes through a lot of city troubles, until a girl named Yuri rescues him, and calls him \"Blackie.\" Later, Hak thinks that he doesn't belong with the chasers anymore, and feels useless to them, so Hak leaves the team. He ends up in the street like a stray cat. Later, Yuri finds him and takes him home. Yuri says she has another pet \"friend\" for him, but the friend is Duran. It is later revealed that both Hak and Duran used to be friends, before the current Dragonoid-Tigeroid War began. However, they quickly become friends again. Soon afterwards, both the Dragonoids and the Tigeroids figure out that their friend is missing, and start to look for them. Jahara leaves the Luftdrake to look for Duran. At Yuri's house both pets fight over trying to get Yuri's attention, thinking if Yuri doesn't like them much, then they will end up on the streets again. Jahara finds them and tries to kill Hak. However, Duran stalls her and defends Hak, until the Chasers could rescue him, while telling Jahara about his friendship with Hak. The Tai Chi Chasers team then shows up, and Finn says that there is a Tai Chi card nearby. However, Yuri has the card, and it is the \"like\" card. After Rai obtains the card, Yuri runs away from both pets, feeling afraid. Then, both the Dragonoid and Tigeroid teams fight after Yuri leaves, and the Chasers win, which allows both \"pets\" go to their right home. For failing to kill Hak, General Mischka decides to punish Jahara, since she did not return with the Tai Chi card, but instead returned with the \"pathetic creature\" (Duran). Mishka coldly attacks Jahara with a powerful Tai Chi blast, which knocks her to the floor in pain. However, this angers Duran, since he believes that Jahara saved his life. Later, Jahara talks to Duran alone, telling him that she likes having him around, even though he is annoying."

However, the Tigeroid Airships won't be able to make it back to the unprotected base, even at maximum speed. However, Tori uses his \"fast\" Tai Chi card on the Chasers' Airship, allowing it to move way ahead of the other Airships. However, it is too late, since the Dragonoids Jakata and Dag have already entered the base, and began attacking, while moving directly towards the base's Character chamber. When the Tai Chi Chasers finally get to the secret Tigeroid base, Tori passes out from using his fast card too many times, and the Tigeroid airship is attacked by Terra and Lita. The Tigeroid Airship crashes from the loss of its main engine, which prevents them from getting to the Tigeroid base. Sena and Donha stay behind to deal with Terra and Lita, while Finn and Rai head to the base. Meanwhile, Komorka manages to stall Jakata and Dag, by trapping them with the Ahm \"darkness\" card. However, when Hannah shows up, Jakata manages to capture them, which forces Komorka to release the Dragonoids from her Darkness card, and bring them to the Character Chamber. When Jakata notices the chamber is empty, he demands to know where Komorka hid them, until he finds the Tai Chi Characters disguised, as Hannah's bow tie, which they manage to steal. At that time, Rai comes into the room and fights Jakata, while Dag escapes with the Tai Chi Characters, without notice. Rai manages to injure Jakata severely, before chasing after Dag. Outside the base, Sena and Donha manage to defeat Terra and Lita, reverting them into dolls. Back inside the base, Finn is fighting the Dragonoid robots when he sees Dag fly by, taking the robots with him. Rai uses the woo/wing card to give chase after Dag, even though Komorka warns him not to. As Rai leaves, Jakata escapes in a bad condition, and vows that the fight isn't over yet. Rai manages to get past the Dragonoid robots, and confronts General Mishka himself. Mishka uses the Yi \"Movement\" card to evade Rai's attacks, and then tells Rai the will fight him another time. Unfortunately, the Dragonoids manage to get away. Later, General Mishka defeats Dag (which reverts him into a doll), when he does not immediately give Mischka the Tigeroids' Tai Chi Characters. Mischka then laughs, saying that he now has both the Dragonoids' and the Tigeroid's Characters, which makes him close to becoming the Tai Chi King. Back at the Tigeroid base, Rai is placed under arrest, due to an accusation of being a Dragonoid spy, as the Tigeroids have observed Rai using the \"Wing\" card, which is a Dragonoid card which only a Dragonoid should be able to use.",

        "General Mischka returns to Suhn, in order to begin his conquest of the Universe. When he arrives, 2 Dragonoid ships begins to chase after him. However, General Mischka uses his newly gained Tai Chi Characters to crash both ships, since he knew that Emperor Diga now knew about his plan to become the Tai Chi King. Lord Gherba (Diga's personal guard) then informs Emperor Diga of Mischka's betrayal. As a result, Diga flies into a rage, and orders Gherba to hunt Mischka down and retrieve the lost Characters, using whatever means necessary. Meanwhile, Rai is accused of being a Dragonoid spy and sentenced to petrification, by the Tigeroid Elder Pyron. The truth about Rai is revealed. Rai is part Dragonoid. However, the other chasers manage to help Rai escape, along with help from the Masked Tigeroid. When Elder Pyron discovers that the Tai Chi Chasers were helping Rai escape, via the security cameras, he orders his Tigeroid soldiers to arrest them all. The other Tigeroids also try to help the chasers escape (secretly), minus those under the command of Elder Pyron. The chasers all head to the Gate Room, because that is the only way they can escape to Suhn, to stop General Mischka. Meanwhile, the Masked Tigeroid sets a fire in the main generator room, which temporarily distracts Pyron. Along the way, Hannah tricks a squad of Pyron's soldiers into running down the wrong hallway, which prevents the chasers from being caught. However, Elder Pyron and his soldiers manage to catch up to the chasers, in the Gate Room. There, Elder Komorka convinces Elder Pyron (the only elder who believes Rai to be guilty) to let Rai and the Tai Chi Chasers go. Rai and the other chasers then escape to the Tigeroid/Dragonoid homeworld of Suhn, through the activated portal. (This episode is the conclusion to the 4-part Season 2 finale on Toonzai.)",
