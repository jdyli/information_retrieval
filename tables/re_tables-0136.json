        "Terri was the major character in the early years and the whole premise of the show was about her adjustment to working in a hospital as a nun. Throughout the years, she shed the chains of sisterhood, after Mitch came onto the show telling her that he liked her better when she had her legs wrapped around him. This led to the revelation that she entered the nunnery after a disastrous relationship with Mitch. When she understood why she became a nun, that it wasn't truly a calling, but really an escape, she left. After she re-entered public life, she warily began dating again but always mourned the loss of her relationship with Mitch, who had by then married Rose and had a baby with her. When Rose (suffering bi-polar disorder) became a menacing threat in her life, she tried hard to be a supportive friend to Mitch. Rose died after a confrontation with Terri, and eventually Mitch and Terri were free to be together. They were very happy together, raising Mitch and Rose's daughter, until Mitch was diagnosed with a brain tumour which caused him to act irrationally, making her fear for her safety prior to understanding what was causing it. Once the brain tumour was diagnosed, Terri arranged a secret wedding for her and Mitch to be together. Soon after they were married, Mitch underwent surgery to treat the brain tumour but it was unsuccessful, and he died. Terri fell apart as a result of this, drinking and passing out in her neighbour's yard on a regular basis. She managed to get herself together to return to work, but Ward 17 was being permanently shut and she and her staff were being reassigned to the Emergency Department, under Frank. One of Frank's first conversations with her was to tell her that he wasn't going to baby her staff like she did, and he swore at her, using the \"F\" word, which was totally unexpected for the show. Terri managed to have a fling with Jack Quade, but was always uncomfortable about the age difference. Her closest confidante was Von, and eventually she left the hospital for good, having undergone much throughout the years. Terri and Mitch were going to baby son who died via miscarriage as Terri fell over at work.",

        "Bart, 'Homer' to Frank, was the intern in the ED since 2006. Bart is a very switched on doctor and, according to Frank, is \"A Born Physician\". Late in 2006, Bart was shot in the ED by an angry family member of a patient and his life became very hard. He was unable to move well and, as Frank felt it was his fault, Bart moved in with him. In 2007, at the end of his internship, Frank realised that he could not keep Bart on as a permanent staff member as the budget wouldn't allow it. Upon telling Bart the unfortunate news, Bart left the ED straight away to start his surgical rotation with Mike. It was then that Mike offered him a permanent position the Surgery Department which Bart accepted, knowing little about how much effort Frank was going to, to find a way that Bart could stay in the ED.

He\u2019ll be the first to offer you a hand should you stumble but also the first to tell you to pull your head in if you get out of control. He has a temper. And it really doesn\u2019t take much to set it off. No one has ever accused Steve of being safe or predictable. Steve is the father of gabrielle's baby which he will help to raise when it is born.",
        "Steve is a country boy, from the same part of the world as Gabrielle. After graduating from University, he spent years working in rural areas across Australia as a locum. He never stayed at any hospital for too long, telling everyone that he was a gypsy by nature, desirous of changing scenery, new faces and new experiences. But maybe it was his love of alcohol that led to his unsettled lifestyle. He is strong and fit\u2014a man who is comfortable in his own skin and can handle himself in any situation. He has a strong work ethic and a natural curiosity. If he can take something apart, he will. And you can bet that he will be able to put it back together again, maybe even better than it was. Passionate, competitive and tactile, he can\u2019t be missed in a room. He doesn\u2019t ask for attention but gets it anyway. Above everything, Steve is a brilliant doctor. Steve isn\u2019t one to run from a challenge\u2026 professionally or personally. He has burnt his romantic bridges with Gabrielle, whom he loved dearly and will always have a soft spot for, but he is now at the point where he has been able to forgive himself for the sins of his past (a past he\u2019s not terribly proud of) and look to a more promising future. In fact, challenge is what he craves most and the new Medical Response Unit feels like the right place to offer him those challenges. Steve is hard to resist\u2026 he\u2019s energetic and fun to be around. His sense of humour can take the tension out of a moment and he has the ability to make you feel like you\u2019re the only person in the world. He\u2019ll be the first to offer you a hand should you stumble but also the first to tell you to pull your head in if you get out of control. He has a temper. And it really doesn\u2019t take much to set it off. No one has ever accused Steve of being safe or predictable. Steve is the father of gabrielle's baby which he will help to raise when it is born."

        "Adam is every patient's dream - a doctor who genuinely cares about them. Nothing is too much trouble, no ailment too insignificant - if it's affecting your quality of life in any way, then it needs Doctor Freeman's healing touch. Maybe that has a lot to do with his upbringing. Adam's earliest memories are of hiding with his brothers from an abusive father who liked to take out his frustrations on his wife and children. By the age of 14, Adam had had enough. After a particularly nasty night of violence in his home, he took to the streets. He did his best to nurse his injuries until he finally collapsed and was rushed to the local hospital. And there he was nursed in the Paediatric ward by Von Ryan, who saw something in the kid that other nurses didn't see. She saw the bright spark that had almost, but not quite, been extinguished. She saw Adam's intelligence and good humour. And she saw the potential in a boy who was going to end up dead if someone didn't intervene. So intervene she did, and to this day, Adam views Von as the one and only person who actually cared about him. Through her faith in him and the work she did to get him into care and back to school, Adam thrived in both body and soul. And on the day he graduated with a medical degree, there was only one person he invited to the ceremony - Von - and she attended with pride. Adam's a man of boundless energy and he'd argue that his inability to stop and take time out for himself is because that energy has to be channelled into something or he'll explode. He's a natural communicator with and protector of women. God help the man who feels he can raise a hand to one. Abuse of any description makes Adam lose all perspective. He can behave quite badly under these circumstances, becoming unpredictable and even dangerous at times. And he quite literally hates himself when he loses it. His temper reminds him a little too much of his father. He knows the statistics of the \"abused becoming the abuser\" and fights against it at every turn. It's why intimacy is difficult for him and long term relationships scare the hell out of him. On top of this, Adam's compassion and eagerness to help often leads him into dangerous territory. Not necessarily for those around him but for his own psychological well-being. Quite simply, his greatest asset is often his downfall - Adam cares too much. He's unable to create and maintain the professional barrier that so many Doctors use to keep their sanity intact. And this often leads to dark, sleepless nights or a need to escape for a while and run off the feelings that threaten to overwhelm him. If he could step back occasionally and realise that \"intention\" and \"result\" don't always match, he'd be a much healthier soul. Adam and Charlotte get married and find out that Charlotte is pregnant with girls whom they name Lucy and Mary.",

        "Claire is a vibrant young woman, whose compassion for patients and competence as a nurse is immediately apparent to those around her. She is able to deal with the most confronting of situations (a patient's fear or their relative's grief) with seeming ease and as a result, people tend to trust in her quickly and look to her for advice. However, it isn't quite as easy for Claire to trust others and once we discover the reasons for her being here instead of in her home State, we'll understand why. Claire is calm, composed and rational in almost all arenas of her life but one thing she cannot cope with is aggression. She's had too much of that in her life. Her younger years were tainted with alcohol-fuelled rages from her father, and Claire made the mistake of falling in love with a man who had very similar tendencies. Any conflict in their relationship was solved with a fist, and Claire found herself making all the same excuses for black eyes and split lips that her mother used to make. After a particularly bad night, when her partner took out his frustrations over losing a job on her, Claire decided she'd had enough. Once he fell into a stupor, Claire packed the bare minimum of belongings and took off. She hasn't looked back, hasn't contacted him, and would be happy if she never laid eyes on him again. So here she is. Determined to make a new start. As a recent arrival in NSW, Claire has not yet found her professional feet in a new Health system and, as a consequence, has been agency nursing for a few months now while she looks for the right permanent position in the right place. All Saints ED could be just that place and it'd be lucky to have her. Maybe, once she's back on her feet, Claire will explore the possibility of romance again. She'd love nothing more than to be in a healthy relationship in which she and a new partner could prosper but right now, it's enough for her to feel safe. And if she makes some new friends, then that will be a bonus she'll be eternally grateful for. Because right now, she's alone, no friends, no family. But that's a small price to pay, as far as she's concerned, for the strength she gathers on a daily basis. She's not a victim, she's a survivor, and nothing that has happened in her life has managed to undermine her innate sense of optimism and desire to connect with people.",

        "The first and second chapter are a single story. At the beginning of it Karatsu attempts to speak to a homeless person with multiple scars and eyes that have been sewn shut identified by Numata as dead. However, the person turns out to be actually alive and walks off from the two who are fighting over the matter. About half a year later the Delivery Service finds a body that died of organ failure from rejected transplants and after turning him in at a hospital meet Sasayama for the first time. \"X+Y=Love\" starts out with a person answering a doorbell just to be struck with a baton and killed. Yata and Numata, on a part time job trying to get newspaper subscriptions, come across the body but the corpse appears to have suffered amnesia from the attack as Karatsu finds out when he attempts to speak to it. In \"Waltz\" Numata finds an ear with his dowsing ability stuck inside a manga anthology. Karatsu finds that the only thing the ear can \"remember\" is song that seems to have more behind it than it appears.",

An explanation of how it works from the New York Regional Reserve Bank of the US Federal Reserve system. Scroll down to the \"Reserve Requirements and Money Creation\" section. Here is what it says: \"Reserve requirements affect the potential of the banking system to create transaction deposits. If the reserve requirement is 10%, for example, a bank that receives a $100 deposit may lend out $90 of that deposit. If the borrower then writes a check to someone who deposits the $90, the bank receiving that deposit can lend out $81. As the process continues, the banking system can expand the initial deposit of $100 into a maximum of $1,000 of money ($100+$90+81+$72.90+...=$1,000). In contrast, with a 20% reserve requirement, the banking system would be able to expand the initial $100 deposit into a maximum of $500 ($100+$80+$64+$51.20+...=$500). Thus, higher reserve requirements should result in reduced money creation and, in turn, in reduced economic activity.\" The link to this page is: http://www.newyorkfed.org/aboutthefed/fedpoint/fed45.html Bank for International Settlements - The Role of Central Bank Money in Payment Systems. See page 9, titled, \"The coexistence of central and commercial bank monies: multiple issuers, one currency\": http://www.bis.org/publ/cpss55.pdf A quick quote in reference to the 2 different types of money is listed on page 3. It is the first sentence of the document: \"Contemporary monetary systems are based on the mutually reinforcing roles of central bank money and commercial bank monies.\"",
