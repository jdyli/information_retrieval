Conan reveals through Serena that Felix, the set designer, killed Jessica and made an attempt on Rachel's life. Knowing Felix has expertise in technical production, Conan deducts he faked the kidnapping, and that Jessica was already dead before it. With the problem of the murderer's weight, Conan reveals that Felix stuffed his shirt with the axe murderer's costume and at one point Jessica's head, making him appear heavier than he actually is. Felix confesses and explains that Jessica's award-winning script, The Blue Kingdom, was stolen from Emily, the sixth member of the club. Being crushed, Emily committed suicide the day after Jessica won her award, causing Felix to become enraged. Rachel had seen a much-thinner Felix momentarily when she accidentally barged into his room, therefore being a target before realizing what she saw. Felix attempts to stab his own throat but is stopped when Conan, through Serena, scolds him for trying to kill Rachel and killing Jessica, stating his actions have dishonored Emily's memory, and he brokenheartedly surrenders to the club.",

The suitors are about to leave when the house butler informs them that all their cars have had a tire slashed. When all the guests have left, the remaining people are Reika, her suitors, Richard and party and the maid, Nonee. Reika suggests a game of cards to pass the time. Quentin Mifune, a suitor, declines and offers to chaffuer Richard home but is stopped by Reika who calls him a coward for not wanting to participate. Reika leaves the group to change clothes. After a few hours, she has not returned, so the group splits up and searches for her. Conan and Richard stumble upon the corpse of suitor Steve Sloan, a victim of drowning. Some believe Reika, having not been found, is to blame. To calm everyone's nerves, Nonee and Rachel volunteer to make tea. After Rachel sips her own, she feels tired and soon falls sleep. Conan remembers the group was talking about an accident and believes it may have something to do with Steve's murder. The accident involved Reika, the suitors and Nonee's granddaughter, Sonja. Steve and Reika went missing during a storm. Sonja went looking for them, but Steve and Reika returned without Sonja, who had been found the next day, drowned.

Richard examines the body and finds that unlike Steve's murder and the attack on Rachel, Reika had been bound with rope and duct tape and her clothes were soaking wet. Richard analyzes the facts and deduces that the murder took place between 5 and 6 A.M. This cleared suitors Donald Hiblar and Michael Stewart along with the maid Nonee. At that time, however, suitors Dirk Copeland and Quentin Mifune were not accounted for. Dirk claimed he saw Quentin heading in the direction of the bathroom but Quentin denies entering. Then, by accident, Conan turns on the water and the shower head comes on. Richard scolds and warns him he will get wet. With that statement, Conan has figured out how Reika was killed. He puts Richard to sleep and proclaims he's solved the case. He asks the suitors to remove their jackets. Conan notices where water stains are located on the men's shirts. Conan deducts that Donald Hiblar is the murderer. First, Donald rejoined Steve in the search for Reika, which gave him the perfect opportunity to murder him. Next, he made it look like the murderer had cut the power and escaped through the window by causing a power surge and breaking the window. Donald's next act was to drug Rachel's tea. While everyone believed Rachel was attacked for a reason, there was none, and Donald had chosen a victim at random because all he wanted was a witness to confirm she was drowned the same way Steve was. While it appeared that all three murders were done the same, each was unique in different ways. Reika was tied up, duct taped and the shower-head was turned on to insure she drowned slowly and quietly, and thus Donald's alibi. The evidence is on his shirt elbows where the water stained when he removed Reika, as he rolled up his sleeves. He confesses and says Sonja was murdered by Steve and Reika and this was revenge.

Richard examines the body and finds that unlike Steve's murder and the attack on Rachel, Reika had been bound with rope and duct tape and her clothes were soaking wet. Richard analyzes the facts and deduces that the murder took place between 5 and 6 A.M. This cleared suitors Donald Hiblar and Michael Stewart along with the maid Nonee. At that time, however, suitors Dirk Copeland and Quentin Mifune were not accounted for. Dirk claimed he saw Quentin heading in the direction of the bathroom but Quentin denies entering. Then, by accident, Conan turns on the water and the shower head comes on. Richard scolds and warns him he will get wet. With that statement, Conan has figured out how Reika was killed. He puts Richard to sleep and proclaims he's solved the case. He asks the suitors to remove their jackets. Conan notices where water stains are located on the men's shirts. Conan deducts that Donald Hiblar is the murderer. First, Donald rejoined Steve in the search for Reika, which gave him the perfect opportunity to murder him. Next, he made it look like the murderer had cut the power and escaped through the window by causing a power surge and breaking the window. Donald's next act was to drug Rachel's tea. While everyone believed Rachel was attacked for a reason, there was none, and Donald had chosen a victim at random because all he wanted was a witness to confirm she was drowned the same way Steve was. While it appeared that all three murders were done the same, each was unique in different ways. Reika was tied up, duct taped and the shower-head was turned on to insure she drowned slowly and quietly, and thus Donald's alibi. The evidence is on his shirt elbows where the water stained when he removed Reika, as he rolled up his sleeves. He confesses and says Sonja was murdered by Steve and Reika and this was revenge.

        "It's the Christmas season and Rachel, Serena and Conan are shopping and talking about, among other things, boyfriends. Serena's new boyfriend/acquaintance is pop-star Justin Moon of the band Lex. The three meet the band at kareoke and quickly discover that Justin is little more than an arrogant, selfish person. Justin's signature song, \"Bloody Venus\" comes on, and he steps up to sing. He rips his jacket in the beginning of the song, something he normally does. When the song ends, the caterer Georgie brings in a spread. Justin grabs a riceball and talks about breaking up the band and wanting to go solo. Before he can finish another sentence, he collapses and dies. Upon initial examination, Conan smells cyanide and realizes this was murder, instigated by one of the band members. Inspector Meguire is called in. Conan meanwhile examines the scene for any hints of motive. Amber, Lex's guitarist, is sighted as a suspect because of her love for Justin. Justin already had a girlfriend who was \"away for a while\" and called it quits. With no solid evidence though, Meguire can't convict Amber. He returns to the station empty-handed. Conan notices a photograph in the room of another band. In the photograph is Justin; Sledge, the drummer of Lex and two unknown women. Sledge says one of the women is Mazy, the manager of Lex even though she looks nothing like the current Mazy. Using past evidence, Conan has solved the case. Meanwhile, the inspector gets a telephone call to meet him back at the karaoke room. He tells Rachel and Serena who are in the car with him on the drive that Jimmy Kudo has solved the case. Back at the karaoke room, the song \"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer\" is playing over the loudspeaker. This song was what drove the murderer over the edge when Justin requested it for her. The murderer is Mazy. The evidence is in Mazy's Lex jacket. It's Justin's lighter. Mazy placed the cyanide on her jacket and switched her band jacket with Justin's. When Justin ripped his jacket of during \"Bloody Venus\", the cyanide was exposed. His death was hurried when he ate a riceball with his contaminated hand. Mazy confesses and says that Justin hated her after she had plastic surgery even though it was done to impress him. On the back of the photograph is a love song written by Justin dedicated to Mazy, making her realize he did still, in fact, love her. Mazy realizes her mistake and bursts into tears.",

However, Jimmy appears and reveals that Harley's deduction of the murder is incorrect, stating that the key's position inside Isao's pocket would be impossible if he was murdered that way due to the tightness. He also reveals the string and needle were found in many rooms and that they were meant to convict Isao's father. As for the real murder method, Jimmy explains the Opera music and book stack were to cover the victims screams and face in case Isao woke up after being pricked by the poison needle. He then reveals the murderer to be Kimi and exclaims the evidence is in her keyholder which should reveal the groove of a needle. Kimi confesses and explains Isao framed her former husband of corruption resulting in his death and tricked her into marrying him. Isao revealed it all in a fit of rage when he discovered his son was dating Yukiko, daughter of Kimi and her former husband and she then formulated a plan to murder him. As Kimi is taken away by the police, Jimmy escapes to the bathroom and becomes Conan again. Rachel finds him in the bathroom and asks him about Jimmy's whereabouts, but collapses soon after. Three days later, Conan plans on drinking Paikaru to become Jimmy again, but Rachel hides it upon discovering him drinking alcohol. As Conan is escorted by his friends to the Library, he opts to play with them one last time before returning to normal.",
