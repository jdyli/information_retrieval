        "In the Philippines, Blade recalls the time that when he as a child, he was caught by a police officer who caught him standing up for a bullied kid and was supported by Tara Brooks' friend Carol, who stated that Eric has done the right thing. Another flashback has Blade remembering the night his mother was attacked by Deacon Frost. When Carol came home, she found Eric awake and tells him that his mother would be with him in spirit. Later, Eric came across a murder scene and started to show signs of his vampire genes kicking in as he ran away. He later found a policeman dead and Carol's apartment in flames. In the present, Makoto and Razor approach Blade, wondering what is eating him. Blade tells Makoto that the neighborhood they are in runs on fear as they are spied upon by two humans working for the Existence. Later that night, Matthes is informed by her human spies that Blade is in the Philippines and tells Noah that they will give Blade a warm welcome. Matthes then states that her orders were to obtain a blood sample of Blade and then kill him. Following a nightmare, Makoto has a brief moment of tears as Blade knocks on her door. Blade states that Makoto is lucky to have known her father before he turned. Makoto asks Blade about what Noah mentioned about darkness in Blade's soul. In a flashback, Eric went into her apartment and found his mother in vampire form biting Carol. When she tried to have Eric come to her, Eric grabbed a fallen knife and tells the vampire Tara that she is not his mother and slew her. Tara snapped out of it and apologized to Blade before she turned to ash. In the present, Blade states that his mother was the first vampire that he killed and that his Daywalker appearance was a gift from his mother. Blade tells Makoto that she has to be willing to fight the darkness within her. Blade says his goodbyes to Captain MacRae as Makoto accompanies Blade's hunt for vampires. Blade stumbles upon a slave ship. Matthes learns that Blade is attacking the slave ship, and Matthes and her followers assume their Mandurugo forms and fly to the harbor. Makoto and Razor infiltrates Matthes' mansion and manage to free Noah. At the harbor, Blade fights the Mandurugos and slays most of them. Matthes then fights Blade, who then uses his Residual Move attack on Matthes. Before she turns to ashes, Matthes states to Blade that he will never defeat Frost. The next morning, Noah thanks Blade for saving him. Noah tells Blade that he heard Matthes stating in a conversation that Frost has an underground hideout on a remote island. Noah tells Makoto to take Razor and help Blade fight Frost. Somewhere near the shore, Frost learns that Matthes has fallen in battle with Blade and states that it is time for him to come out into the open. He then informs his driver to take him to his base on Siquijor Island.",

Blade remembers their time studying under the swordmaster Tanba Yagyu where their fight was in a draw. Tanba tells both of them that they haven't got what it takes to be a swordsmaster yet. Later that day, it was revealed that Eric Brooks has trained by Tanba for two years and is planning to return to Noah van Helsing. Tanba tells Eric that he has learned well and that their training isn't done yet. Tanba then has them learn the most important lesson involving them learning the final sword technique called Chaotic Moon. Upon Eric's departure the next day, Kikyo still wants to duel Blade much to the objections of Tanba. Eric and Kikyo duel where Eric manages to wound Kikyo in the right heel. Eric then leaves saying goodbye to Tanba and Kikyo. Back in the present, Kikyo tells Tanba that it isn't over until the final blow is struck. During their fight, Tanba Yagyu makes a surprise appearance stating that he is paying them a visit to them. Tanba reveals that he has become a vampire. In the past, Tanba tells Kikyo that his training is done and that he must learn the lessons of the real world as Kikyo states that he was taken in by Tanba when he was just a boy with no memory. After Kikyo leaves, Tanba has come down with a case of lung cancer. Tanba received what appeared to be a letter from Noah van Helsing revolving around dealing with a murderous vampire. When it came to his \"last fight,\" Tanba discovered that the vampire in question is no ordinary vampire as the vampire in question is Deacon Frost. Tanba learns that it was a trap as he slays the Vampire Ninjas despite his declining health. Deacon Frost manages to grab him and tells him that there is another choice other than death as he offers him a choice to join him and become a vampire. Deacon Frost ends up biting him anyway. Blade and Kikyo were shocked that Deacon Frost did this to Tanba who then draws his sword. Kikyo then plans to make things right as Tanba deflects Kikyo's wind attacks. Tanba then fights Blade stating that he kept his training up. Tanba then assumes a younger appearance as he fights Blade. Meanwhile, Mokoto and Razor notice a helicopter heading towards Blade and recognizes it as Deacon Frost's helicopter. When Tanba asks Blade to show him what he learns, Blade states that his master is long gone. Tanba then begins to use the Chaotic Moon on Blade where he manages to wound him. Blade manages to knock Tanba off him and pull the sword out of him. Blade then uses his own Chaotic Moon technique to vanquish Tanba. Before he ashes, Tanba thanks Blade for restoring him to humanity, thanks Blade for guiding him back on the right track, and states to Blade and Kikyo that it was an honor to be their teacher. Deacon Frost's helicopter arrives as Deacon Frost states that he was late to Tanba's fight with Blade. Blade then attacks Deacon Frost only to be defeated and taken on board Deacon Frost's helicopter by some Existence members. When Kikyo gets up, Deacon Frost tells Kikyo that their contract was terminated. Mokoto encounters Kikyo who tells her that Deacon Frost has taken him to his main research facility in Cambodia.

Tanba then fights Blade stating that he kept his training up. Tanba then assumes a younger appearance as he fights Blade. Meanwhile, Mokoto and Razor notice a helicopter heading towards Blade and recognizes it as Deacon Frost's helicopter. When Tanba asks Blade to show him what he learns, Blade states that his master is long gone. Tanba then begins to use the Chaotic Moon on Blade where he manages to wound him. Blade manages to knock Tanba off him and pull the sword out of him. Blade then uses his own Chaotic Moon technique to vanquish Tanba. Before he ashes, Tanba thanks Blade for restoring him to humanity, thanks Blade for guiding him back on the right track, and states to Blade and Kikyo that it was an honor to be their teacher. Deacon Frost's helicopter arrives as Deacon Frost states that he was late to Tanba's fight with Blade. Blade then attacks Deacon Frost only to be defeated and taken on board Deacon Frost's helicopter by some Existence members. When Kikyo gets up, Deacon Frost tells Kikyo that their contract was terminated. Mokoto encounters Kikyo who tells her that Deacon Frost has taken him to his main research facility in Cambodia. As Mokoto and Razor run off to Cambodia, Kikyo states to himself that Deacon Frost has earned himself a new enemy.",
        "While Blade and Kikyo Mikage fight, Blade states to Kikyo that he will take him down if he has to. Blade uses his Residual Moon move which Kikyo evades. Blade remembers their time studying under the swordmaster Tanba Yagyu where their fight was in a draw. Tanba tells both of them that they haven't got what it takes to be a swordsmaster yet. Later that day, it was revealed that Eric Brooks has trained by Tanba for two years and is planning to return to Noah van Helsing. Tanba tells Eric that he has learned well and that their training isn't done yet. Tanba then has them learn the most important lesson involving them learning the final sword technique called Chaotic Moon. Upon Eric's departure the next day, Kikyo still wants to duel Blade much to the objections of Tanba. Eric and Kikyo duel where Eric manages to wound Kikyo in the right heel. Eric then leaves saying goodbye to Tanba and Kikyo. Back in the present, Kikyo tells Tanba that it isn't over until the final blow is struck. During their fight, Tanba Yagyu makes a surprise appearance stating that he is paying them a visit to them. Tanba reveals that he has become a vampire. In the past, Tanba tells Kikyo that his training is done and that he must learn the lessons of the real world as Kikyo states that he was taken in by Tanba when he was just a boy with no memory. After Kikyo leaves, Tanba has come down with a case of lung cancer. Tanba received what appeared to be a letter from Noah van Helsing revolving around dealing with a murderous vampire. When it came to his \"last fight,\" Tanba discovered that the vampire in question is no ordinary vampire as the vampire in question is Deacon Frost. Tanba learns that it was a trap as he slays the Vampire Ninjas despite his declining health.

While Blade fights Deacon Frost, Kikyo Mikage deals with a seven-headed vampire monster. Noah van Helsing surveys the battlefield as he detonates the Existence's arsenal. Blade enters Deacon Frost's castle and confronts Deacon Frost. When Blade states that he is sending Deacon Frost to Hell, Deacon Frost activates the ultimate vampire species as he thanks Blade for his \"help\" into giving him the means of destroying the High Council. Deacon Frost leaves as his ultimate vampire creations attack. Meanwhile, Noah van Helsing and Razor fight their way towards the blood source as he is targeted by the Mandurugos and the Manananggals until Razor saves him. Kikyo Mikage manages to behead the seven-headed vampire monster as Noah van Helsing drops the water used by Agus into Armarot's blood supplies. Blade fights by more of the ultimate vampire species as they are shown to not have the same weaknesses as the other vampires. Deacon Frost undergoes a blood infusion. Razor crashes the Mandurugo into the tainted blood supplies as it spills throughout Armarot affecting every vampire that comes in contact with it. The ultimate vampire species assume a second form that enables them flight. While racing the ultimate vampire species up the stairs,, Blade makes it to the top of Deacon Frost's castle and fights by the ultimate vampire species. Kikyo Mikage crashes the multi-headed vampire species into the support beam of Armarot which collapses it's dome to enable more sunlight to kill more vampires. Deacon Frost states to Blade that his ultimate vampire species have the same powers as Blade. When Deacon Frost asks about Mokoto, he figures out that Blade killed her to put her out of her misery and that he is killing the people he loved. Blade charges towards Deacon Frost while fighting the ultimate vampire species where it is discovered that the ultimate vampire species are not immune to silver. Deacon Frost kills one of the ultimate vampire species as he assumes a much more powerful form where Deacon Frost finds himself unharmed by the sun. Deacon Frost states that a new day has come to the vampire world. Blade then proceeds to fight Deacon Frost who proves too powerful for Blade and punches him into a wall. Blade continues his fight with Deacon Frost where his punches blocked one of Blade's attacks. Deacon Frost is stabbed in the hand as Blade punches Deacon Frost out the window. As they are falling, Blade stabs Deacon Frost in the heart with his mother's knife in order to avenge the innocent lives that he took and finally destroys Deacon Frost. Armarot then begins to collapse upon the force of Deacon Frost's destruction. In the ruins of Armarot, Noah van Helsing tells a truck driver that there is no sign of Blade. Razor barks at Blade's arrival as Noah van Helsing tells Blade that he knew Blade would come through. Kikyo Mikage tells Blade that they both won this time and leaves.

The winner will race a super-charged Ariel Atom against a 200 mph sports bike, while the loser will have to take part in a stunt, courtesy of HISTORY channel's newest series, American Daredevils."

Rutledge was annoying and they complained that the host ate their food and Adam's guests thought things got worse when we got out of the car which implies as Adam points out they liked the comfort of the car.

The trio also have a race to the hotel they will stay at Tanner once again takes a short cut ignoring the road closed and the deep snow warning signs and gets stuck whilst Adam and Rutledge stick to the main road and win waiting for Tanner who when he arrives thinks that he has won only to find that he is quite the opposite. Adam And Rutledge finally can gloat about Tanner taking a short cut. Challenge 3 The three prepare to scale Mammoth Mountain and all fit snow tires to their car wheels and they all agree that the one who wins is the overall winner.Tanner blasts into the snow and soon gets stuck Rutledge and Adam manage to pass Tanner Adam manages to quickly get in the lead but soon gets stuck and tactics and slaloms up the Mountain Rutledge gets stuck and goes off to get some coffee and a breakfast. Adam instead of actually using the car to get him to the mountain uses another vehicle to get him to the mountain. Once again Tanner get stuck and in order to win leaves his Range Rover to get to the top of the mountain only to find Adam has made it there before him. However Tanner realises that Adam didn't get his car up the mountain on its own so Tanner declares he is the winner. Rutledge turns up a few minutes later on a snowmobile.they leave the mountain in Adam's Cadillac. Winner Adam and Tanner"

        "Logan introduces Yukio to Cyclops as they make their way to Madripoor. After dropping off the duo on the beach, Cyclops heads home. Yukio and Wolverine are then ambushed by pirates and easily dispatch them. Logan goes on ahead leaving Yukio to handle the pirates alone. At night as Logan reaches another shoreline, vagrants jump him only to be shocked at his power. Two bikers chain Wolverine's leg from a motorcycle and drive him to a post and hang him upside-down. Not showing any concern, Logan cuts himself down and takes the motorbike. As soon as a mob of people come after him, a young girl throws knives at the men, killing them. The girl states that she saved Logan in hopes that he could work with her, but he turns her down. After she says she works with others who try and stop Kurohagi, Logan wants answers. She questions his reasons for wanting to kill Kurohagi, but he will not answer. She tells Logan where to find Kurohagi, in the most brightly lit tower on the island called Dragon Palace. Meanwhile, blindfolded Yashida cuts candles off a table and lines them up along the flat side of his katana, entertaining guests to his daughter's wedding, and throws them on to pillars of a gold statue of Kurohagi's father. As Kurohagi thanks Yashida for the show, a subordinate tells him that Logan is on the island. Despite Min's warnings, Logan still chooses to go. Knowing now Wolverine is on the island, Kurohagi sends the behemoth statue Vadhaka to take him which sends tremors through the island. The creature walks in front of Logan stating it's been decreed he must die.",

        "When Vadhaka attacks Logan and Min, she tells him that the statue belongs to Hideki Kurohagi and is the spirit of Madripoor, but the statue cannot move unless the seal is removed. As they run, a crazed mob attacks and Logan directs them to a dead end alley way. Logan tries to protect Min, only for a rival group to attack the mob that chased the two. As soon as they flee the mobs, the statue intercepts them with Logan using his unbreakable skeleton to shield Min from Vadhaka's fists. Logan brings out his claws on the wall so Min has space to escape as he gets pummeled, but is captured by the locals. Yukio then saves Min with her ring blade, then Wolverine resumes fighting. Vadhaka then kicks Logan into the building behind him and Logan makes his way to fight the former in a more spacious area. Yukio pours quick-drying cement on Vadhaka to give Logan a chance to get out. Thinking that Vadhaka is encased in the cement, Logan and Yukio make their way only for the statue to easily break free and attack. Min arrives and uses a steam pipe that burns her hands to distract Vadhaka long enough for Logan escape far from the battle scene, but with Yukio hidden under debris. In the sewer as Logan tries to leave Min, a group approaches that Min says are her friends. As Logan tries to leave, he catches a knife-tip cane and throws it back. Logan meets Master Koh who offers a trade with Logan. Meanwhile, Kikyo arrives on the island killing four locals who attack him as he searches for Logan. Koh informs Logan that the wedding will be earlier than first thought, and he needs Logan to help win a guerilla war to retake Madripoor. Elsewhere, it turns out that Vadhaka is an A.I.M. robot. Koh tells the story of how Juo Kurohagi gained control of the island and how he is Yukio's grandfather on her father's side. He mentioned how his son Kai fell in love with Shingen's assassin Miyuki until they were attacked by Juo Kurohagi's men and killed in combat by Shingen. Before Juo can do the same to Koh, Kai throws a dagger at Juo's arm at the last minute. Logan does not piece the latter fact together. When the cameras in Koh's base are hijacked, Hideki puts Yukio on screen saying he will kill her if Logan does not surrender. When Koh hears this, he tells Logan that Yukio is his granddaughter.",

He mentioned how his son Kai fell in love with Shingen's assassin Miyuki until they were attacked by Juo Kurohagi's men and killed in combat by Shingen. Before Juo can do the same to Koh, Kai throws a dagger at Juo's arm at the last minute. Logan does not piece the latter fact together. When the cameras in Koh's base are hijacked, Hideki puts Yukio on screen saying he will kill her if Logan does not surrender. When Koh hears this, he tells Logan that Yukio is his granddaughter.",
        "When Vadhaka attacks Logan and Min, she tells him that the statue belongs to Hideki Kurohagi and is the spirit of Madripoor, but the statue cannot move unless the seal is removed. As they run, a crazed mob attacks and Logan directs them to a dead end alley way. Logan tries to protect Min, only for a rival group to attack the mob that chased the two. As soon as they flee the mobs, the statue intercepts them with Logan using his unbreakable skeleton to shield Min from Vadhaka's fists. Logan brings out his claws on the wall so Min has space to escape as he gets pummeled, but is captured by the locals. Yukio then saves Min with her ring blade, then Wolverine resumes fighting. Vadhaka then kicks Logan into the building behind him and Logan makes his way to fight the former in a more spacious area. Yukio pours quick-drying cement on Vadhaka to give Logan a chance to get out. Thinking that Vadhaka is encased in the cement, Logan and Yukio make their way only for the statue to easily break free and attack. Min arrives and uses a steam pipe that burns her hands to distract Vadhaka long enough for Logan escape far from the battle scene, but with Yukio hidden under debris. In the sewer as Logan tries to leave Min, a group approaches that Min says are her friends. As Logan tries to leave, he catches a knife-tip cane and throws it back. Logan meets Master Koh who offers a trade with Logan. Meanwhile, Kikyo arrives on the island killing four locals who attack him as he searches for Logan. Koh informs Logan that the wedding will be earlier than first thought, and he needs Logan to help win a guerilla war to retake Madripoor. Elsewhere, it turns out that Vadhaka is an A.I.M. robot.

Logan holds him long enough for Yukio to kill Shingen to avenge her parents. She collapses from blood loss and confesses to killing Asano. She says she is ashamed for doing so and considers Logan a friend as she dies in his arms. Kikyo takes Logan to the catacombs to find Mariko and Hideki (who is restraining Mariko from deactivating the bombs). While in an elevator, Kikyo and Logan feel the shock of explosives blowing up the palace and pry open the elevator. The two make it to the bunker and lift open the door to the tomb. Kikyo holds the door long enough for Logan to get in. Hideki holds Mariko hostage and shoots Logan as he approaches. The dart pumps a little amount of the poison into Logan, but is enough to seriously harm him even with his healing factor. Hidkei pulls a gun and plans to put a bullet in Logan's head. Mariko defends Logan saying that Hideki will have to kill her if he wants to hurt Logan, to which he slaps her aside. But as he does so, Logan tackles him, injects the dart into Hideki, and kills him. As Logan poisoned Hideki, he shot a round which fatally wounded Mariko who dies in Logan's arms. Hideki ends up falling dead into his father's casket. Logan carries Mariko's body to a cliffside, where he tells her that he's going to continue on without her, because that is what she would've wanted. He then screams into the distance. In the scene after the credits Logan and Kikyo start the battle that they had postponed.",
        "Logan's wounds heal in an instant and he fights Shingen. Shingen smacks Wolverine off a ledge and down through the hollow core of the castle. As Hideki brings a noncompliant Mariko to his office, he pulls out the A.I.M. poison dart gun from a secret safe, in the event Logan shows up for him. Hideki hears a noise in the next room, and hears Logan injured. As he is going to shoot Logan, Shingen returns to stop him and finish his fight with Logan. As Shingen readies to cut off Logan's head, Yukio intervenes, only to be seriously injured with Shingen barely having a scratch. Hideki prepares to shoot Logan, Mariko tries to stop him, but is rendered unconscious. Kikyo intercepts the dart and removes enough of the poison to not kill him. Logan cuts Shingen's sword and tears his kimono, but finds he was wearing an exo-armor, made of Vibranium and Steel, this whole time. The battle goes on to where the two dive out of a window and land in a filled pool. As the battle rages, Hideki takes an unconscious Mariko and Kikyo helps Yukio. Wolverine and Shingen leave the pool with Yukio and Kikyo watching. Meanwhile, Hideki brings Mariko to his father's secret tomb and tells her he was the one who poisoned his father for his criminal empire, because he wanted to show he was a worthy successor even though his father belittled him. Hideki activates a bomb that will destroy the palace in 3 minutes. Logan gains the upper hand and punctures Shingen's throat with his claws.

The X-Men are horrified and Beast surmises that the medicine is weakening and this power source is leaking from the lab, causing the accelerated Damon-Hall Syndrome in mutants living near Tohoku. Entering the center, they discover Mastermind next to a near-comatose young man who Yui reveals to be Takeo (the still-living son of her and Charles). Mastermind reveals that Yui allied with the U-Men to save her son, an Omega-class telepath with the uncontrollable power to warp reality, which Mastermind wishes to use to change reality to one with mutants in power. He also reveals that he initiated the U-Men into the Inner Circle to get closer to Takeo, supporting the U-Men this entire time. In disguise as Jun, he purposefully withheld power suppressants from Takeo for the past three months and gradually destroyed his mind with telepathy, leaving him ripe for use. The Inner Circle's White Bishop Neuron appears and kills Riko and K\u014dichi by overloading their sensory input. He then subdues Logan and Beast while Mastermind causes Takeo to unleash his powers. Meanwhile in the dimensional rift, Charles is able to break free after hearing Jean Grey's voice encouraging him not to give up.",

Meanwhile, Beast and Logan are at Neuron's mercy, while Marsh restrains Emma, Yui, and Hisako. Hisako remembers that Takeo was her childhood friend at the mutant school, but she was accidentally injured when his powers manifested (resulting in the pain in her hand). Takeo's guilt caused him to erase himself from everyone's memories. Yui shut down the school to care for him and seek a means to subdue his powers. Meanwhile, Logan devises a plan to have Beast overload his sensory input until he goes into a berserker rage where he feels no pain, neutralizing Nueron's powers. Wolverine kills Neuron and regains his senses. Hisako and Cyclops are able to defeat Marsh, but Mastermind entraps Cyclops in a nightmarish illusion about his inability to kill Dark Phoenix. However, he manages to break free of the illusion due to the intervention of Jean Grey, who helps him realize that his true regret was his inability to free her of her suffering as Dark Phoenix by killing her when she begged him to. The X-Men face Mastermind, but he is killed by Takeo as his powers run out of control and Takeo transforms into a colossal energy being capable of destroying the world and shattering reality. Professor X arrives from the Blackbird in time to confront his son alongside the X-Men.",

        "While wondering about the mysterious new armor, Tony finishes his shower and spots Chika outside. When going out towards Chika, Tony is hit by a tranquilizer dart as he and Chika are kidnapped. Following an interview, Nanami spots Tony's car and attempts to follow it, but he and Ichiro are stopped by a Zodiac. When they find Tony's car, they find him gone and spots a yacht as Nanami reports suspicious activity. On a boat, a mysterious Zodiac operative works on Tony Stark. Tony and Chika awake to find themselves on a remote island near Japan that has been used for landfill and Tony's arc reactor is missing. While exploring the island, they are approached by Yinsen who reveals himself to be a member of Zodiac and that the Yinsen he knew is dead. When Tony states that Yinsen wouldn't side with Zodiac, Yinsen tells Tony he has 24 hours of pacemaker power to decide whether or not he wants to join Zodiac stating that they need a man with his talent. Yinsen then leaves stating that Tony shouldn't waste his time trying to escape. Tony and Chika attempt to use the various scrap on the island to find a method of escape when Chika's cell phone has no reception. Tony connects Chika's phone to a laptop he found on the island only for them to receive a transmission from Yinsen stating that all wireless signals within the radius of the island are jammed. When asked by Tony what made Yinsen flipped, Yinsen states to Tony that he should make the time he still has to join Zodiac or not. While on his boat, Yinsen thinks to himself stating that he will unlock Tony's real him and determine if Tony hasn't broken his promise to him. Zodiac's leader then contacts Yinsen about Tony as Yinsen is researching Tony's arc reactor. Tony and Chika rig up a boat only for them to attacked by another Scorpio robot and knocked off the water. Upon making it to shore, Tony states that he won't be helpful without his arc reactor. Chika states that despite the situation, Tony manages to find a situation. Tony tells Chika that he saw a yacht that Yinsen might be on before Scorpio attacked. Tony states that he must show Yinsen he change and find a way to fight. Meanwhile, Nanami tells Nagato Sakurai about what happened the night when Tony and Chika were kidnapped. Sakurai asks which way the boat went as Ichiru shows the image that fell on Namai's car. Yinsen has Scorpio give him a visual on Tony. When he finds Tony building something, Yinsen tells Scorpio to fire on Tony Stark. Tony and Chika eventually manage to evade Yinsen and Scorpio robot by using a hologram as Scorpio is ordered to eliminate Tony. After a talk with Chika where she is left someplace safe, Tony forges his own rocket. Scorpio manages to corner Tony who prepares to use a flare. When Yinsen hopes that Tony will use the rocket on Scorpio, Tony shoots the rocket into the air which is enough to alert Ramon Zero. Ramon Zero manages to destroy the Scorpio robot. Impressed by Tony not using weapons upon him and Chika making it towards Yinsen's yacht, Yinsen returns the arc reactor to Tony stating that this was just a test. Before escaping in the Iron Man Dio armor, Yinsen states that next time Tony won't be so lucky. Ramon Zero is revealed to be Sakurai who states that he should thank Nanami for her part in the rescue and leaves. As they wait for rescue, Tony and Chika kiss each other after thanking Chika for her help.",

Kuroda orders Sakurai to kill Tony, but Tony escapes and learns about the power regulation from Chika, who tells him that power is being directed to Tokyo Bay before she is taken hostage. As Iron Man heads towards the location, he is attacked by Sakurai in Ramon Zero, but Tony manages to snap him out of it before they are attacked by another Zodiac mech. While Iron Man fights the Zodiac mech, Sakurai heads to the location and discovers Zodiac's weapons factory also learning their leader is Kuroda, who plans to rebuild Japan as a military nation. Sakurai destroys the factory but is killed by Kuroda using his Rasetsu armor. After Iron Man fends off the Zodiac mech, he receives a final transmission from Sakurai telling him that Kuroda is the leader of Zodiac before he dies at the bottom of the harbor."

Meanwhile, Chika admits to Tony that she's been having blackouts and has been controlled into altering the arc reactor, wanting to commit suicide for causing Tony's suffering. Just then, Kuroda approaches them in his Rasetsu armor and takes control of Chika (who had really been a Zodiac warrior) and transforms her into her Zodiac form (the same one that Tony fought in the last episode) to have her attack Tony. As Tony tries to get Chika to believe in herself, she stabs herself to break free from Kuroda's control. Tony leaves Chika in Nanami's care while he goes to fight Kuroda, who was resentful due to his grandparents being killed in the Nagasaki bombing.
