        "Kim is looking for a new roommate. While searching, she takes a man, Bradley, who doesn\u2019t do much for her instead of a man who would do a lot for her. While waiting for him to ask her out, she has to do a lot of work for him. Later, the professor waits for Veronica to come over. He believes that his plan to make her jealous after they broke up has worked. Unfortunately for him, she believes that he has moved on and she gets engaged to another man in one week. This gets the professor very depressed. In fact, when Nikki comes over to his apartment, he doesn\u2019t even notice. She decides to take advantage of him; she moves in all of her furniture into his house. Kim is still trying to get Bradley to ask her out. When he holds a bachelor party there, he has a stripper over. Kim notices that the stripper actually is a man, meaning that Bradley is gay. Kim decides to kick him out after he doesn\u2019t pay the rent, acts like a slob, and doesn\u2019t ask her out. Nikki and the professor go out on a date where they have dinner and watch a show. The show is about a man and a couple of women who date the man. Nikki interrupts the show several times, but by the end, the professor does. He gives the woman in the act a speech about what Veronica has done to him after she got engaged. He talks to her as if he were talking to Veronica, which makes him feel better. He then realizes he\u2019s on a date with Nikki, so he kicks her out of his apartment and becomes conscious again. Later, Nikki learns that Bradley moved out of Kim\u2019s apartment. Kim says she doesn\u2019t have a roommate anymore, but surprise, surprise!",

Doctore is charged with preparing the two men for the drought-breaking primus, but receives little satisfaction from either man. Spartacus tries to find common ground with his arch-enemy but Crixus remains stalwartly opposed to sharing any of the glory. Meanwhile, after the visit of a fertility priestess, Lucretia is denied a chance to conceive as Crixus, distracted by Naevia, declines her advances. Meanwhile, the wounded Batiatus continues his own investigations into the attempt on his life, and exacts blood vengeance on Ovidius, the cousin of Magistrate Calavius, and his family.

Meanwhile, a festering wound from the fight with Varro weakens Spartacus, and while he recuperates with the help of the medicus and Mira, more visions of the dead haunt his feverish dreams. In the arena, Crixus reclaims some of his lost glory when he is needed in the primus against Pompeius' unbeaten champion, Pericles - a fight he narrowly wins.

Spartacus also plots vengeance, but is warned by Mira that any attack on the master risks the life of all slaves. When finally granted an audience with Batiatus, he stays his hand when he notices Varro's widow, Aurelia, now working as a debt-slave. The ludus later awaits the arrival of Ilithyia and her husband Claudius Glaber, and Batiatus ends up being irked by Glaber's bluntness, but also surprised by his wife's pregnancy. Meanwhile, Spartacus fights against Glaber's soldiers, and Ashur's vengeful scheming finally exposes the relationship between Crixus and Naevia, leading to a scene. When Glaber refuses to sponsor Batiatus, he and Lucretia desperately reveal Ilithyia's hand in Licinia's murder and Glaber is forced to acquiesce. In the end, Crixus is flogged while Naevia is sold - but before leaving, she tells Doctore the truth behind Barca's \"freedom\".",

        "As the gang is walking into the Student Union, they find the place a mess. They find Woody sitting on a chair depressed. He tells them that he asked Mavis, his girlfriend, to marry him, but she turned him down. Stevie thinks that Mavis needs more time, but Woody is growing impatient. He sees the professor walking in. The professor is disgusted by the position of the Student Union. He hears of Woody\u2019s little problem. When Woody asks the professor if he can move in, he immediately refuses. Woody is disappointed, but the professor decides to let him come. Woody then asks the professor to take his suitcase to his apartment. Nikki and Andell are talking. Andell is telling Nikki about a man she goes out with named Lester. Nikki has been hearing about Lester everyday for the last month; she thinks there is something serious between him and Andell. Andell tells him that she plans on making love to him after their date. When Lester comes over to their apartment to pick Andell up, Kim tells Nikki that she has to cancel their plans to go to the mall; she has rehearsal. When Lester hears that Nikki\u2019s plans for the night are gone, he decides to let her come with him and Andell on their date. Andell doesn\u2019t want her to come, but she decides to let her come if she eats fast. After the date is over, Lester walks Nikki and Andell home. When Nikki gets to her apartment, Andell is relieved. Unfortunately for her, Lester feels it is getting late and has to go. Andell is left upset. The professor walks into his apartment to find the lights turned off. He finds Woody in the living room playing the harmonica. The professor is confused by this, but he decides to give Woody some food. Then he sees that his vintage wine has been drunk. He decides to retire to his bedroom while Woody continues to play his harmonica. Andell and Lester are driving to a restaurant. Andell is telling Lester of the things she\u2019s planning to do with him. While she is telling him of all these things, her cell phone rings. Nikki is asking her to pick her up from a place. Andell is upset about this, but she goes to pick her up. Nikki is in the back of Lester\u2019s pickup truck when they pick her up. She is cold; Lester feels that they should let her into the front. When they let her in, Nikki suggests that they let her come with them to a new restaurant. Once again, Nikki ruins one of Andell\u2019s dates. The professor is bussing the tables at the Student Union. Kim, Stevie, and T are wondering why. It turns out that Woody is too depressed to go to work; the professor is filling in for him so he doesn\u2019t get fired. The professor is still very angry about letting Woody stay in his apartment. When Stevie asks the professor whether Woody is suicidal, he\u2019s not; the professor left all the windows open and Woody\u2019s still inside. The gang then suggests a makeover for Woody. This can probably bring Mavis back into Woody\u2019s life and take Woody out of the professor\u2019s apartment. Kim, Stevie, and T are getting ready to give Woody a makeover. When they learn that Nikki is going out with Andell and Lester again, the begin to wonder: does Andell mind having her over? Nikki says yes; they always do things together; that Kim, Stevie, and T know nothing about friendship. Later, Andell comes by Nikki\u2019s apartment. This time, she gives Nikki her earrings that she loves so much. When Andell starts asking Nikki to get ready, Nikki is wondering what she is up to. Andell tells him that \u201ca special someone\u201d is coming by. When Nikki asks if it\u2019s the professor, Andell says yes. Nikki is very excited about this; she can finally have a date with the professor\u2026 When Nikki and Andell get to the restaurant, they see Lester and another man. The man is not the professor. Instead, Lester brings a man named Johnnie. Nikki reminds Andell that she said it was going to be the professor. Andell lied; but if everything works out, this man will be her new lover. Andell and Lester walk away while they leave Nikki and Johnnie alone. Nikki doesn\u2019t want to offend Johnnie, so she talks with him a little. She tells him that she is already engaged; she doesn\u2019t want to do anything that will hurt her relationship. Johnnie feels the same way; he also is engaged. Nikki and Johnnie have found one thing they have in common: they are crazy about love. Then they find something else: they both like grape-flavored Remy Red. Kim, Stevie, and T are having trouble giving Woody the makeover. While Stevie is teaching Woody some sophisticated words, he twists them into Ebonics. When the professor is teaching him how to sniff wine and determine its bouquet, Woody continues to use Ebonics. When T\u2019s turn comes, he must do Woody\u2019s hair. The problem is, Woody doesn\u2019t have any hair. He decides to give his head a shine\u2026 Later, Nikki and Johnnie are still talking while Andell and Lester return. They have been having a good time talking about \u201ceverything under the sun.\u201d Andell feels it\u2019s time to go home, but Nikki and Johnnie don\u2019t feel like going yet. Andell feels that she should take Nikki home since she brought them there, but Johnnie says that she can take Nikki home. Lester then tells Andell that if he takes Nikki home, then she can take him home. Andell doesn\u2019t take a second to think and immediately goes home with Lester. Johnnie and Nikki continue to talk. The time has come for Woody to see Mavis again. He makes an entrance by walking in as a classy man from the professor\u2019s room at his apartment.. He hears the doorbell and answers to Mavis. When Mavis sees him, she is confused; she can\u2019t tell if that is really Woody at first glance. Woody Takes her to her seat at a table in the professor\u2019s living room. He shows them their dinner. When he takes a seat, he pours them two glasses of soda; the wine just isn\u2019t working for Woody. After he and Mavis start eating, Woody gets down on one foot and proposes to Mavis. Mavis immediately accepts after seeing his ring. While she and Woody are sharing a kiss, Woody backs down. He tells her that he can\u2019t put on this act anymore; if she can\u2019t accept him for who he is, then he just can\u2019t marry her. Mavis tells him that he does love him for who he is, she just wants to be treated special too. She\u2019ll marry him if he puts on this act once every month. Woody then tells her once every six months. Mavis\u2019 final offer is once every two months and he has a deal. The professor then yells, \u201cDeal!\u201d from another room while taking out Woody\u2019s suitcase. While he is celebrating with his \u201cvictory dance,\u201d Woody and Mavis share another kiss. Finally, Nikki and Johnnie arrive home from the restaurant. They feel they had a nice time there. Johnnie then tells Nikki that if he didn\u2019t have his fianc\u00e9e, he would definitely be chasing Nikki. Nikki then tells him, if she didn\u2019t have the professor, he wouldn\u2019t have to chase her. While he is about to leave, Johnnie gives Nikki a little peck on the lips, but one second later, it becomes a bigger peck. Johnnie then realizes what he is doing. He apologizes to Nikki. She accepts his apology with a nod. While he is about to open the door, he then goes back and he and Nikki mutually share a very big kiss. To Be Continued\u2026",

When Stevie asks the professor whether Woody is suicidal, he\u2019s not; the professor left all the windows open and Woody\u2019s still inside. The gang then suggests a makeover for Woody. This can probably bring Mavis back into Woody\u2019s life and take Woody out of the professor\u2019s apartment. Kim, Stevie, and T are getting ready to give Woody a makeover. When they learn that Nikki is going out with Andell and Lester again, the begin to wonder: does Andell mind having her over? Nikki says yes; they always do things together; that Kim, Stevie, and T know nothing about friendship. Later, Andell comes by Nikki\u2019s apartment. This time, she gives Nikki her earrings that she loves so much. When Andell starts asking Nikki to get ready, Nikki is wondering what she is up to. Andell tells him that \u201ca special someone\u201d is coming by. When Nikki asks if it\u2019s the professor, Andell says yes. Nikki is very excited about this; she can finally have a date with the professor\u2026 When Nikki and Andell get to the restaurant, they see Lester and another man. The man is not the professor. Instead, Lester brings a man named Johnnie. Nikki reminds Andell that she said it was going to be the professor. Andell lied; but if everything works out, this man will be her new lover. Andell and Lester walk away while they leave Nikki and Johnnie alone. Nikki doesn\u2019t want to offend Johnnie, so she talks with him a little. She tells him that she is already engaged; she doesn\u2019t want to do anything that will hurt her relationship. Johnnie feels the same way; he also is engaged. Nikki and Johnnie have found one thing they have in common: they are crazy about love. Then they find something else: they both like grape-flavored Remy Red. Kim, Stevie, and T are having trouble giving Woody the makeover. While Stevie is teaching Woody some sophisticated words, he twists them into Ebonics. When the professor is teaching him how to sniff wine and determine its bouquet, Woody continues to use Ebonics. When T\u2019s turn comes, he must do Woody\u2019s hair. The problem is, Woody doesn\u2019t have any hair. He decides to give his head a shine\u2026 Later, Nikki and Johnnie are still talking while Andell and Lester return. They have been having a good time talking about \u201ceverything under the sun.\u201d Andell feels it\u2019s time to go home, but Nikki and Johnnie don\u2019t feel like going yet. Andell feels that she should take Nikki home since she brought them there, but Johnnie says that she can take Nikki home. Lester then tells Andell that if he takes Nikki home, then she can take him home. Andell doesn\u2019t take a second to think and immediately goes home with Lester. Johnnie and Nikki continue to talk. The time has come for Woody to see Mavis again. He makes an entrance by walking in as a classy man from the professor\u2019s room at his apartment.. He hears the doorbell and answers to Mavis. When Mavis sees him, she is confused; she can\u2019t tell if that is really Woody at first glance. Woody Takes her to her seat at a table in the professor\u2019s living room. He shows them their dinner. When he takes a seat, he pours them two glasses of soda; the wine just isn\u2019t working for Woody. After he and Mavis start eating, Woody gets down on one foot and proposes to Mavis. Mavis immediately accepts after seeing his ring. While she and Woody are sharing a kiss, Woody backs down. He tells her that he can\u2019t put on this act anymore; if she can\u2019t accept him for who he is, then he just can\u2019t marry her. Mavis tells him that he does love him for who he is, she just wants to be treated special too. She\u2019ll marry him if he puts on this act once every month. Woody then tells her once every six months. Mavis\u2019 final offer is once every two months and he has a deal. The professor then yells, \u201cDeal!\u201d from another room while taking out Woody\u2019s suitcase. While he is celebrating with his \u201cvictory dance,\u201d Woody and Mavis share another kiss. Finally, Nikki and Johnnie arrive home from the restaurant. They feel they had a nice time there. Johnnie then tells Nikki that if he didn\u2019t have his fianc\u00e9e, he would definitely be chasing Nikki. Nikki then tells him, if she didn\u2019t have the professor, he wouldn\u2019t have to chase her. While he is about to leave, Johnnie gives Nikki a little peck on the lips, but one second later, it becomes a bigger peck. Johnnie then realizes what he is doing. He apologizes to Nikki. She accepts his apology with a nod. While he is about to open the door, he then goes back and he and Nikki mutually share a very big kiss. To Be Continued\u2026",
        "As the gang is walking into the Student Union, they find the place a mess. They find Woody sitting on a chair depressed. He tells them that he asked Mavis, his girlfriend, to marry him, but she turned him down. Stevie thinks that Mavis needs more time, but Woody is growing impatient. He sees the professor walking in. The professor is disgusted by the position of the Student Union. He hears of Woody\u2019s little problem. When Woody asks the professor if he can move in, he immediately refuses. Woody is disappointed, but the professor decides to let him come. Woody then asks the professor to take his suitcase to his apartment. Nikki and Andell are talking. Andell is telling Nikki about a man she goes out with named Lester. Nikki has been hearing about Lester everyday for the last month; she thinks there is something serious between him and Andell. Andell tells him that she plans on making love to him after their date. When Lester comes over to their apartment to pick Andell up, Kim tells Nikki that she has to cancel their plans to go to the mall; she has rehearsal. When Lester hears that Nikki\u2019s plans for the night are gone, he decides to let her come with him and Andell on their date. Andell doesn\u2019t want her to come, but she decides to let her come if she eats fast. After the date is over, Lester walks Nikki and Andell home. When Nikki gets to her apartment, Andell is relieved. Unfortunately for her, Lester feels it is getting late and has to go. Andell is left upset. The professor walks into his apartment to find the lights turned off. He finds Woody in the living room playing the harmonica.

He decides to retire to his bedroom while Woody continues to play his harmonica. Andell and Lester are driving to a restaurant. Andell is telling Lester of the things she\u2019s planning to do with him. While she is telling him of all these things, her cell phone rings. Nikki is asking her to pick her up from a place. Andell is upset about this, but she goes to pick her up. Nikki is in the back of Lester\u2019s pickup truck when they pick her up. She is cold; Lester feels that they should let her into the front.

Instead, Lester brings a man named Johnnie. Nikki reminds Andell that she said it was going to be the professor. Andell lied; but if everything works out, this man will be her new lover. Andell and Lester walk away while they leave Nikki and Johnnie alone. Nikki doesn\u2019t want to offend Johnnie, so she talks with him a little. She tells him that she is already engaged; she doesn\u2019t want to do anything that will hurt her relationship. Johnnie feels the same way; he also is engaged. Nikki and Johnnie have found one thing they have in common: they are crazy about love. Then they find something else: they both like grape-flavored Remy Red. Kim, Stevie, and T are having trouble giving Woody the makeover. While Stevie is teaching Woody some sophisticated words, he twists them into Ebonics. When the professor is teaching him how to sniff wine and determine its bouquet, Woody continues to use Ebonics. When T\u2019s turn comes, he must do Woody\u2019s hair. The problem is, Woody doesn\u2019t have any hair. He decides to give his head a shine\u2026 Later, Nikki and Johnnie are still talking while Andell and Lester return. They have been having a good time talking about \u201ceverything under the sun.\u201d Andell feels it\u2019s time to go home, but Nikki and Johnnie don\u2019t feel like going yet. Andell feels that she should take Nikki home since she brought them there, but Johnnie says that she can take Nikki home. Lester then tells Andell that if he takes Nikki home, then she can take him home. Andell doesn\u2019t take a second to think and immediately goes home with Lester. Johnnie and Nikki continue to talk. The time has come for Woody to see Mavis again. He makes an entrance by walking in as a classy man from the professor\u2019s room at his apartment.. He hears the doorbell and answers to Mavis. When Mavis sees him, she is confused; she can\u2019t tell if that is really Woody at first glance. Woody Takes her to her seat at a table in the professor\u2019s living room. He shows them their dinner. When he takes a seat, he pours them two glasses of soda; the wine just isn\u2019t working for Woody. After he and Mavis start eating, Woody gets down on one foot and proposes to Mavis. Mavis immediately accepts after seeing his ring. While she and Woody are sharing a kiss, Woody backs down. He tells her that he can\u2019t put on this act anymore; if she can\u2019t accept him for who he is, then he just can\u2019t marry her. Mavis tells him that he does love him for who he is, she just wants to be treated special too. She\u2019ll marry him if he puts on this act once every month. Woody then tells her once every six months. Mavis\u2019 final offer is once every two months and he has a deal. The professor then yells, \u201cDeal!\u201d from another room while taking out Woody\u2019s suitcase. While he is celebrating with his \u201cvictory dance,\u201d Woody and Mavis share another kiss. Finally, Nikki and Johnnie arrive home from the restaurant. They feel they had a nice time there. Johnnie then tells Nikki that if he didn\u2019t have his fianc\u00e9e, he would definitely be chasing Nikki. Nikki then tells him, if she didn\u2019t have the professor, he wouldn\u2019t have to chase her. While he is about to leave, Johnnie gives Nikki a little peck on the lips, but one second later, it becomes a bigger peck. Johnnie then realizes what he is doing. He apologizes to Nikki. She accepts his apology with a nod. While he is about to open the door, he then goes back and he and Nikki mutually share a very big kiss. To Be Continued\u2026"

When Nikki arrives, Kim tells her. Nikki doesn\u2019t think of it as a big deal. She thinks that school just isn\u2019t for Kim and she should follow her own destiny; she should try and become a fashion designer. First, Kim will need a loan, so she decides to ask her father. Nikki then sees the professor. He tells them of good news: he got a teaching job at Weatherly University. Nikki is happy about this; this is her first choice college. The professor is shocked by this; he feels he will never get rid of Nikki. Nikki and Johnnie are playing a game against Andell and Lester. They have been beating them the whole time. When Andell grows tired of losing, she decides to leave with Lester. Johnnie and Nikki both notice that neither one of them mentioned their lovers. While about to share a kiss, Kim walks in. It turns out that she can\u2019t get a loan from her dad because he is tight on cash. Later, Nikki receives a letter from Weatherly University. She is to nervous to open it, so she has Kim open it. Kim reads that Nikki didn\u2019t get in, but then she reads that this university \u201cwill not be accepting any more new students\u2026 ever.\u201d Stevie takes a look at it. The letter isn\u2019t written on Weatherly stationery. Nikki takes a look at the letter. She takes a sniff and scent that it is the professor; she knows that scent anywhere. Kim then tells her that her loan from the bank was rejected as soon as she said her name. Stevie then decides to help her out with business. Later, T comes over to her with a newspaper article. Johnnie wrote her a little poem. This raises Nikki\u2019s spirits; she realizes that she doesn\u2019t need the professor anymore. Andell and Nikki are talking about Johnnie. They realizes that they haven\u2019t talked about the professor in a long time. Later, Johnnie comes over. He come with good news: he was promoted to head chef. Nikki is so proud of him.

Stevie and T are upset; this is the end of Freestyle Unity. Later, Stevie receives a call from Bill, her mother\u2019s boyfriend. He would love to invest in Kim\u2019s business. She and Kim decide to go into business together. Later, the gang notices the professor. He is trying to get signatures for a petition to keep Nikki out of Weatherly University. The gang tells him that there\u2019s no need for that; Nikki is over with him. The professor think that it is hard to believe. He was wondering why \u201che had a Miss Parker-free date.\u201d He feels that he is too much of an attraction\u2026 Kim is pulling Nikki along with her as they run back to their apartment. She tells her that she has to go to the bathroom, but when they get in, she reveals that Johnnie has turned the living room into a Jamaican paradise. Kim leaves and Nikki spends the time with Johnnie. She feels a little self-conscious about this, and at the same time, disappointed. After having their dinner, Johnnie makes a speech. He tells her that he just can\u2019t live his life without her. She gets down on one foot and proposes to her. Nikki is shocked at this. Before she gives her answer, she goes out on the balcony and prays to God. She needs to know if Johnnie is the right man for her. After receiving many \u201csigns from God\u201d such as thunder and earthquakes, she goes back in. Johnnie is starting to regret proposing -- not for him, but for her.

The letter isn\u2019t written on Weatherly stationery. Nikki takes a look at the letter. She takes a sniff and scent that it is the professor; she knows that scent anywhere. Kim then tells her that her loan from the bank was rejected as soon as she said her name. Stevie then decides to help her out with business. Later, T comes over to her with a newspaper article. Johnnie wrote her a little poem. This raises Nikki\u2019s spirits; she realizes that she doesn\u2019t need the professor anymore. Andell and Nikki are talking about Johnnie. They realizes that they haven\u2019t talked about the professor in a long time. Later, Johnnie comes over. He come with good news: he was promoted to head chef. Nikki is so proud of him. Then he tells her that he\u2019ll have to move to New York; he won\u2019t be coming back. Nikki is very upset about this. Johnnie then tells her that he can still keep in touch with her after he moves out, and they still have two weeks. They decides to celebrate later. As Johnnie walks out the door, Nikki is filled with a lot of depression. T goes over to Kim and T. He tells them that got in to Berklee\u2019s School of Music. Stevie and T are upset; this is the end of Freestyle Unity. Later, Stevie receives a call from Bill, her mother\u2019s boyfriend. He would love to invest in Kim\u2019s business. She and Kim decide to go into business together. Later, the gang notices the professor. He is trying to get signatures for a petition to keep Nikki out of Weatherly University. The gang tells him that there\u2019s no need for that; Nikki is over with him. The professor think that it is hard to believe. He was wondering why \u201che had a Miss Parker-free date.\u201d He feels that he is too much of an attraction\u2026 Kim is pulling Nikki along with her as they run back to their apartment. She tells her that she has to go to the bathroom, but when they get in, she reveals that Johnnie has turned the living room into a Jamaican paradise. Kim leaves and Nikki spends the time with Johnnie. She feels a little self-conscious about this, and at the same time, disappointed. After having their dinner, Johnnie makes a speech. He tells her that he just can\u2019t live his life without her. She gets down on one foot and proposes to her. Nikki is shocked at this. Before she gives her answer, she goes out on the balcony and prays to God. She needs to know if Johnnie is the right man for her. After receiving many \u201csigns from God\u201d such as thunder and earthquakes, she goes back in. Johnnie is starting to regret proposing -- not for him, but for her. He feels that he is rushing things\u2026 Nikki doesn\u2019t care. She says yes. To Be Continued\u2026"

        "Nikki is showing off her engagement ring to the gang down at the Student Union. Everyone is impressed. When the professor sees it, he gets very excited; so excited, he back-flips his way out of the Student Union. Later, Stevie, Kim, and Woody are talking at the Student Union. Woody tells them that he and Mavis opened up their own restaurant. Stevie and Kim are happy for him as they also have their own business. T comes over later. He starts feeling very upset that these are their last moments together. He gives them a hug to show his sympathy. Stevie and Kim do their best to show the same sympathy. Later, Regina comes over to them. Without saying anything, the gang finds out that she is pregnant. She continues to tell it to everybody on campus. Andell comes over to Nikki\u2019s apartment from her trip to Las Vegas. She tells Nikki that she hit the jackpot---she got married. They didn\u2019t have a formal wedding, but Nikki reassures her: the point is, they got married; that she finally found her soul mate---and so did she. She shows off her ring to Andell. Andell is very happy for her. Nikki says that she will be getting married to Johnnie in two different ceremonies. Her parents can\u2019t make it in the first ceremony, so she\u2019s going to have another one. She tells her that she will be getting married in a church---this is when the phone rings. The pastor calls and tells her that they can\u2019t have her wedding at the church on her day; they have a five-day conference. Nikki is upset about this, but at least she has her catering to look forward to---the phone rings again. This time, Ingrid, her caterer, cancels on her to go to a celebrity wedding. Nikki is in distress; she is worried that the next call she receives will be Johnnie. Nikki is wondering if it is right to get married to Johnnie. Andell won\u2019t have any of this; she will not rest until Nikki and Johnnie are married. She says that they can get married at her restaurant, and if the chef\u2019s not in, Andell can cook for them. Nikki, Stevie, and T are graduating from college. They are wondering whether Kim is upset that she did not receive her degree. She tells them not to worry; she still has her business to fall back on. Johnnie is very proud of Nikki---valedictorian, merit scholarship, etc. He leaves and tells her that he will see her at the altar. The professor comes by later; he gives her a gift certificate for tupperware. After congratulating her, he runs away, hoping he will never see her again. Later, the professor is spending his evening alone. While smoking a cigar, he makes a smoke ring which shows his attitude towards Nikki in previous episodes. Then he hears a voice calling him; a voice which sounds exactly like him. He looks in the mirror and he sees the man. It is his inner voice (or inner self). This voice is telling him that he cannot let Nikki get married. If he does, he will be making the biggest mistake of his life. The professor has a little chat with this \u201cvoice.\u201d He realizes what he is doing. While he is running out of his apartment, the \u201cvoice\u201d looks into the camera and says, \u201cWhat a cornball.\u201d The professor runs up to Nikki\u2019s apartment to tell Nikki that he loves her. When he arrives, he only finds Andell. He asks her for Nikki. Andell is not sure why, but then he tells her that he must marry her, not Johnnie. Andell pays no heed to what he has to say. She tells him that Nikki will finally have a new life, a new family; he will only get in the way. The professor is desperate, so Andell decides to \u201chumor\u201d him. She asks him to get Nikki\u2019s coat from the closet. The professor goes into the closet and looks for it. When he asks which coat is Nikki\u2019s, Andell pushes him into the closet and locks the door. Andell goes to the wedding while the professor is trapped inside. Later, at the wedding, the guests begin arriving. Woody and Mavis arrive. Mavis asks him why he never brought her to Andell\u2019s restaurant before. He jokingly tells her if he did, it would be hard to pick up women. Then, Regina comes in. She continues to tell everybody that she is pregnant. Later, Kim, Stevie, and T hear a loud noise coming from outside. Kim tells them that it\u2019s Shaquan. When she arrives, she and Kim embrace while they use Ebonics. Then Shaquan tells Kim that she knows the father of Regina\u2019s baby. She whispers it into her ear as Kim gives a big gape. Nikki is trying out her wedding dress. Andell is with her. Nikki begins to have thoughts about the professor. Andell tells her to get rid of them; she is getting married to Johnnie; the professor is history. Nikki then agrees and moves on to the wedding. Andell meets Johnnie\u2019s family: his mother, his sister, and his brother. They compliment her while she\u2019s around, but scoff at her and Nikki behind their backs. Kim, Stevie, and T confront Regina. They know the father of her baby. They reveal that it is Freddy Fabulous. It turns out that Shaquan and Freddy go to the same beauty parlor. Regina is very embarrassed about this; she begs them not to tell anyone. They give her their promise, but just seconds later, Kim walks up to Woody to tell him something\u2026 The wedding commences. Nikki is walking down the aisle with Professor Imes. He tells her that he is happy to fill in for her dads, but he is not sure whether people will believe that he is her father. Nikki tells him that everyone may think that he is her brother. They continue walking down the aisle. Professor Imes gives Nikki away to the minister. The minister begins the ceremony. He asks the people if there is any reason why Nikki and Johnnie should not be wed, \u201cspeak now or forever hold your peace.\u201d When no one objects, the minister is about to ask them whether they should get married; this is where Andell interrupts him. She tells them that they cannot be wed because Nikki is in love with the professor, and she is sorry to say that he loves her too. When Johnnie asks why the professor isn\u2019t here to tell Nikki that, Andell gets a little nervous. Then, everyone hears the professor from outside. He is yelling at them to wait. He runs in to the restaurant where Andell greets him. He professor tells her that he now has a dislocated shoulder from banging it against the closet door. Andell decides not to worry about that and just tells him it\u2019s nice to see him there. The professor goes up to the altar. He tells her that he doesn\u2019t blame her for telling him to get lost, but from this day on, no matter what Nikki says, he will always love her. Nikki starts tearing up at this; she tells him that she loves him too. She then turns to Johnnie and apologizes; she loves him, but she has been chasing the professor for years. Johnnie then understands and leaves the altar with a crushed heart. The professor gets down on one knee and \u201cborrows\u201d Johnnie\u2019s ring; with his approval. He asks Nikki to marry him, to which she says yes. The wedding of Nikki and the professor comes to an end when the minister pronounces them husband and wife. After sharing a kiss, they walk down the aisle. Kim begins to sing \u201cAt Last\u201d while T plays the keyboard. Stevie watches them walk together. Nikki and the professor are now married; the way it always should have been; they will now begin their new life together as Mr. and Mrs. Stanley DeVante Oglevee.",

He asks the people if there is any reason why Nikki and Johnnie should not be wed, \u201cspeak now or forever hold your peace.\u201d When no one objects, the minister is about to ask them whether they should get married; this is where Andell interrupts him. She tells them that they cannot be wed because Nikki is in love with the professor, and she is sorry to say that he loves her too. When Johnnie asks why the professor isn\u2019t here to tell Nikki that, Andell gets a little nervous. Then, everyone hears the professor from outside. He is yelling at them to wait. He runs in to the restaurant where Andell greets him. He professor tells her that he now has a dislocated shoulder from banging it against the closet door. Andell decides not to worry about that and just tells him it\u2019s nice to see him there. The professor goes up to the altar. He tells her that he doesn\u2019t blame her for telling him to get lost, but from this day on, no matter what Nikki says, he will always love her. Nikki starts tearing up at this; she tells him that she loves him too. She then turns to Johnnie and apologizes; she loves him, but she has been chasing the professor for years. Johnnie then understands and leaves the altar with a crushed heart. The professor gets down on one knee and \u201cborrows\u201d Johnnie\u2019s ring; with his approval. He asks Nikki to marry him, to which she says yes. The wedding of Nikki and the professor comes to an end when the minister pronounces them husband and wife. After sharing a kiss, they walk down the aisle. Kim begins to sing \u201cAt Last\u201d while T plays the keyboard. Stevie watches them walk together. Nikki and the professor are now married; the way it always should have been; they will now begin their new life together as Mr. and Mrs. Stanley DeVante Oglevee.",
        "Nikki is showing off her engagement ring to the gang down at the Student Union. Everyone is impressed. When the professor sees it, he gets very excited; so excited, he back-flips his way out of the Student Union. Later, Stevie, Kim, and Woody are talking at the Student Union. Woody tells them that he and Mavis opened up their own restaurant. Stevie and Kim are happy for him as they also have their own business. T comes over later. He starts feeling very upset that these are their last moments together. He gives them a hug to show his sympathy. Stevie and Kim do their best to show the same sympathy. Later, Regina comes over to them. Without saying anything, the gang finds out that she is pregnant. She continues to tell it to everybody on campus. Andell comes over to Nikki\u2019s apartment from her trip to Las Vegas. She tells Nikki that she hit the jackpot---she got married. They didn\u2019t have a formal wedding, but Nikki reassures her: the point is, they got married; that she finally found her soul mate---and so did she. She shows off her ring to Andell. Andell is very happy for her. Nikki says that she will be getting married to Johnnie in two different ceremonies. Her parents can\u2019t make it in the first ceremony, so she\u2019s going to have another one. She tells her that she will be getting married in a church---this is when the phone rings. The pastor calls and tells her that they can\u2019t have her wedding at the church on her day; they have a five-day conference. Nikki is upset about this, but at least she has her catering to look forward to---the phone rings again. This time, Ingrid, her caterer, cancels on her to go to a celebrity wedding. Nikki is in distress; she is worried that the next call she receives will be Johnnie. Nikki is wondering if it is right to get married to Johnnie. Andell won\u2019t have any of this; she will not rest until Nikki and Johnnie are married. She says that they can get married at her restaurant, and if the chef\u2019s not in, Andell can cook for them. Nikki, Stevie, and T are graduating from college. They are wondering whether Kim is upset that she did not receive her degree. She tells them not to worry; she still has her business to fall back on. Johnnie is very proud of Nikki---valedictorian, merit scholarship, etc. He leaves and tells her that he will see her at the altar. The professor comes by later; he gives her a gift certificate for tupperware. After congratulating her, he runs away, hoping he will never see her again. Later, the professor is spending his evening alone. While smoking a cigar, he makes a smoke ring which shows his attitude towards Nikki in previous episodes. Then he hears a voice calling him; a voice which sounds exactly like him. He looks in the mirror and he sees the man. It is his inner voice (or inner self). This voice is telling him that he cannot let Nikki get married. If he does, he will be making the biggest mistake of his life. The professor has a little chat with this \u201cvoice.\u201d He realizes what he is doing. While he is running out of his apartment, the \u201cvoice\u201d looks into the camera and says, \u201cWhat a cornball.\u201d The professor runs up to Nikki\u2019s apartment to tell Nikki that he loves her. When he arrives, he only finds Andell. He asks her for Nikki. Andell is not sure why, but then he tells her that he must marry her, not Johnnie. Andell pays no heed to what he has to say. She tells him that Nikki will finally have a new life, a new family; he will only get in the way. The professor is desperate, so Andell decides to \u201chumor\u201d him. She asks him to get Nikki\u2019s coat from the closet. The professor goes into the closet and looks for it. When he asks which coat is Nikki\u2019s, Andell pushes him into the closet and locks the door. Andell goes to the wedding while the professor is trapped inside. Later, at the wedding, the guests begin arriving. Woody and Mavis arrive. Mavis asks him why he never brought her to Andell\u2019s restaurant before. He jokingly tells her if he did, it would be hard to pick up women. Then, Regina comes in. She continues to tell everybody that she is pregnant. Later, Kim, Stevie, and T hear a loud noise coming from outside. Kim tells them that it\u2019s Shaquan. When she arrives, she and Kim embrace while they use Ebonics. Then Shaquan tells Kim that she knows the father of Regina\u2019s baby. She whispers it into her ear as Kim gives a big gape. Nikki is trying out her wedding dress. Andell is with her. Nikki begins to have thoughts about the professor. Andell tells her to get rid of them; she is getting married to Johnnie; the professor is history. Nikki then agrees and moves on to the wedding. Andell meets Johnnie\u2019s family: his mother, his sister, and his brother. They compliment her while she\u2019s around, but scoff at her and Nikki behind their backs. Kim, Stevie, and T confront Regina. They know the father of her baby. They reveal that it is Freddy Fabulous. It turns out that Shaquan and Freddy go to the same beauty parlor. Regina is very embarrassed about this; she begs them not to tell anyone. They give her their promise, but just seconds later, Kim walks up to Woody to tell him something\u2026 The wedding commences. Nikki is walking down the aisle with Professor Imes. He tells her that he is happy to fill in for her dads, but he is not sure whether people will believe that he is her father.
