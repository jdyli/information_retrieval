When Sono almost dies trying to go outside to see wildflowers in their natural beauty, Black Jack tells her father she is being pushed too hard. Sono tells Black Jack she will die anyway so why give her the surgery. Hearing this BJ tells Sono that flowers and human are both beautiful because they live. He states he has seen patients far worse than her including Pinoko who struggled so much to live. Black Jack states if she is not interested in living the operation is off. Later Sono states she wants to live and Black Jack goes ahead with the operation lengthening her life."

Igitur, alma parens Nati tui et filia Virgo decus virginum, Tuus te Florentiae Devotus orat populus, Ut qui mente et corpore Mundo quicquam exorarit Oratione tua Cruciatus et meritis Tui secundum carnem Nati Domini sui Grata beneficia Veniamque reatum Accipere mereatur. Amen. || Recently garlands of roses given by the Pope -despite a terrible winter\u2014 adorned this temple of magnificent structure forever dedicated in a pious an holy fashion to you, heavenly Virgin. Today the vicar of Jesus Christ and successor of Peter, Eugenius, has deigned to consecrate this same vast temple with his sacred hands and holy liquors. Therefore, sweet parent and daughter of your Son, virgin, flower of virgins, your devoted people of Florence prays that anyone in agony who will have prayed for anything with a clean mind and body will deserve to receive by your prayer and the merits of your Son in the flesh the sweet gifts of his Lord and forgiveness of sins.

While at a hospital run by Kreutuzer, Black Jack runs into a little girl named Suzie who mistakes Black Jack for the devil because of his black clothing. Black Jack befriends the girl later and enters the hospital, where he finds out that Kreutzer was in a persistent vegetative state after a car accident.

Black Jack also encounters a woman whom he was familiar with. He discovers that Stein was about to perform an operation that would attach an experimental robotic arm to an aspiring pianist. Black Jack fails to get any answers from Dr. Stein, but does talk to the boy who was about to receive the robotic arm. Black Jack talks to the boy that was about to receive the new arm. The boy admits that he didn't want the robotic arm which would enable him to play the piano with simple thought but would rather keep his human arm and learn to play the hard way.
