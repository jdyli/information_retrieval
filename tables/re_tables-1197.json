Karen's first challenge at the school arrives in the form of the Kirbys \u2013 sixth-former Jonah and 13-year-old genius Ruth \u2013 who have both been home-schooled by their father, Marcus. Marcus's ex-wife, Hannah, wants her children to experience mainstream schooling, but he has little faith in the state education system.

        "The arrival of dynamic new head teacher Karen Fisher heralds a fresh start for the school. Opinionated and ambitious, Karen is determined to bring change, making Waterloo Road a safe and vibrant place to learn. However, Karen's steely exterior masks a deeper fragility as she and her family wrestle with a recent tragedy. Karen's first challenge at the school arrives in the form of the Kirbys \u2013 sixth-former Jonah and 13-year-old genius Ruth \u2013 who have both been home-schooled by their father, Marcus. Marcus's ex-wife, Hannah, wants her children to experience mainstream schooling, but he has little faith in the state education system. While Jonah relishes the opportunity to make new friends and have new experiences, high-achiever Ruth feels she's got little to learn and soon takes matters into her own hands by running away.",

However, when 15-year-old Harry finds a suspicious message on Charlie's mobile about a lunchtime assignation, he begins to suspect his dad is having an affair. Harry dials the number on the text and is shocked to hear new Spanish teacher Cesca answer. He desperately enlists Sambuca's help and they follow Charlie on his lunchtime rendezvous. Together they spy on Charlie with Cesca, taking a photo as evidence. When Harry later tells Karen she refuses to believe him and assures him that it must be innocent.",

        "Waterloo Road is running a new sexual health initiative which includes a confidential emergency contraception service. This causes consternation among parents and staff alike. Ronan and his girlfriend, Sarah, are concerned; their condom broke during sex, but while Ronan wants Sarah to take the morning-after pill, she's too mortified to go to the nurse. Jess also has cause for concern: her promiscuous behaviour has resulted in her needing the morning-after pill \u2013 again. Unable to go to the nurse herself, Jess persuades Vicki to get the pill for her. Vicki reluctantly agrees, but fails when the nurse realises she's not there for herself. The two girls get into a huge fight which results in Vicki revealing Jess's promiscuity in front of Chris. Chris is concerned for Jess's welfare but she misinterprets this as a sign that he still cares for her.",

A seemingly upstanding businessman, Ronan's father is upset that his son is selling his possessions, and both he and Marcus assume Ronan must be in some sort of trouble.

        "When Chris launches a trial scheme to equip the classrooms with CCTV there is uproar among both staff and pupils. Jonah is outraged when he learns that the staff room doesn't have a camera and, along with Ronan, hatches a plan to expose the hypocrisy of the scheme, unwittingly stumbling upon Jess's and Chris's secret in the process. Stunned at his discovery, he promply hurts a bewildered Jess before launching himself at Chris in the middle of the corridor. As the pair desperately try and cover up the truth from Karen, Chris realises he must stop running from the truth. As Karen is faced with a massive decision, Marcus Kirby delivers a shcoking further ultimatum to her. What will Karen do? Elsewhere, through the aid of Jonah and Ronan's planted CCTV camera in the staff room, Grantly's shocking home life is exposed to the year 11's, who taunt him about it in class, and push him to his wits end. Desperate for help, he seeks the aid of a former colleague, and must decide where Fleur's future lies.",

        "The truth surrounding Bex's disappearance is finally revealed when a fellow pupil discovers a shocking secret. It sends shockwaves throughout Waterloo Road and tests Tom's recovery when he's forced to deal with the aftermath. Elsewhere, Sambuca and Finn's mutual antagonism develops in an unexpected way, and Jonah gives Cesca a dramatic ultimatum. Bex finally confronts Karen with the truth surrounding her disappearance when Wayne Bodley, a Year 11 pupil, stumbles across a compromising video of her and spreads the footage around the school. It couldn't be a worse time for Bex, as she prepares her speech on the day of the head pupil elections, and it's left to a still-fragile Tom to get to the bottom of Wayne's behaviour.",

It is set to take place in an abandoned mill and word quickly spreads among the pupils, leaving the teachers in the dark. The party gets off to a good start but events escalate out of control, and it is up to Tom to save the day.

Rachel thinks the worst, and Tom is reluctant as he's only just got his family back, but he joins Eddie, Davina and Grantly. When Grantly insults Bolton's mum, the trip provides Bolton with an opportunity to wreak revenge, but he accidentally puts his own life in grave danger.

The fisherman claim she held a square box \"that no one was allowed to touch\" and she spoke to them in a language they never heard before.

        "When Madi is mugged on the way into school, an enraged Jez responds by starting boxing classes, but these prove short-lived after Zack floors Harley and Michael intervenes. Tariq, meanwhile, has been tasked with recruiting prefects, but Michael changes tack after seeing Tariq's ju-jitsu moves on Jez, instructing him to lead self-defence classes instead. In a rare moment of mutual understanding Tariq confesses to Finn that he was bullied while he was in the young offenders unit, but the pair's new friendship doesn't last long when Tariq discovers the truth about Finn and Trudi's relationship. Meanwhile, Michael is under pressure after concealing the CCTV footage of his altercation with Wayne, and Linda's wayward pet rabbit, Roger, causes mayhem when it is set loose in the school.",

        "The final day dawns on Waterloo Road in Rochdale as Michael arrives to break the news of the schools imminent closure. Pondering the future of the pupils, he discovers that not all of them have received a place at alternative local schools. Reeling from the realisation, Michael tackles the possibility of taking a handful of students with them and asks Lorraine to consider setting up a boarding house at the new school. Elsewhere, Josh returns to school and quickly learns of Finn\u2019s recent involvement in the gang trouble. His worries soon escalate when Eugene and the MSB invade the school to teach Finn a lesson, while Tariq receives a crossbow in the post to which he discovers Kyle has ordered as part of his own revenge against plot. As the school prom gets underway, it\u2019s a race against time to stop Kyle. As Tariq realises the error of his ways, he warns the prom goers of the crossbow just as Kyle takes aim \u2013 and Josh arrives to save Finn. Meanwhile Finn and Trudi get back together and Janeece receives a surprising offer. Later, as the schools conversion into new, luxury apartments gets underway, both staff and students considering the move take a trip to Scotland to visit the new school. During a stop-off at the border, the group revel as Grantly proposes to Maggie - just as an out-of-control lorry hurtles towards them.",
