        "In 1986, at a funeral, a recently deceased man wakes up from his coffin and transforms into a monster known as Fangire. After he attacks a young woman, draining her of her Life Energy and turning her into a material similar to glass, the Spider Fangire is confronted by a woman named Yuri Aso, who attempts to destroy him before he escapes. Later, at the Caf\u00e9 mald'amour, Yuri's employer Mamoru Shima tells her to target a young businessman named Kaoru Tsugami, who actually is the Horse Fangire. She finds Tsugami as he is about to eat his sixth secretary, but he calls his bodyguards to hold her off. Though she manages to give them the slip, she is too late to save the woman as she fights the Horse Fangire. However, before the fight could go any further, she is stopped by the man she met while escaping Tsugami's bodyguards: Otoya Kurenai. This little distraction allowed Tsugami to escape. Twenty-two years later in 2008, a young man named Wataru Kurenai is gathering fish bones for a project of his to create the ultimate violin varnish, attracting the attention of Yuri's daughter, Megumi Aso, who makes him realize he is not allergic to the world. Megumi soon attracts Tsugami's attention, inviting her to model for his studio as an excuse to feed on her. However, Megumi uses Tsugami's scheme to get to him to finish what her mother started. Angry for being tricked, Tsugami assumes his true form and attempts to kill Megumi until Wataru arrives, with Kivat-bat the 3rd allowing him to transform into Kamen Rider Kiva and battle the Horse Fangire. After Kiva shatters the Fangire with his Darkness Moon Break, Castle Doran emerges to devour the Horse Fangire's soul before it can escape. Once the fight ends, however, Megumi attempts to take down Kiva.",

        "In 1986, Yuri is ordered by Shima to protect a beautiful violinist named Hitomi Miyazawa that may be targeted by a mysterious Fangire that is attacking female violinists. Hitomi happens to be a student under Otoya Kurenai, learning that he is a master violinist who quit his profession for reasons unknown. After her concert performance, Hitomi disappears and Yuri attempts to find her, but when she does, Hitomi is revealed to be the Fangire responsible for killing her 'competition' as Otoya arrives. When Yuri damages her violin, Hitomi reveals her true form as the Octopus Fangire and attacks Yuri before escaping with her broken violin. Otoya, after taking Yuri's weapon in a fake-wooing, confronts his ex-student soon after for her disrespect of the musical arts before she escapes him as well. In 2008, after countering Megumi's attempt on his life and walking away from her, Wataru returns home and fails to create the ultimate violin varnish, again, until Shizuka Nomura presents him with a violin that needs to be repaired. After reporting to Shima of Kiva's appearance and given orders not to tell \"him\" of the encounter, Megumi encounters Wataru again as he and Shizuka are looking for suitable wood to repair the violin. After getting Kido's permission, Wataru uses a table in the caf\u00e9 to use as wood to finish the repairs and gives the violin back to its owner: Hitomi, who resumes her feeding starting with Megumi for her mother's acts against her in the past. After being alerted by his father's violin, the Bloody Rose, Kiva arrives and fights the Octopus Fangire. In the ensuing battle, the Fangire's violin is completely destroyed. The Octopus Fangire attempts to outrun Kiva, only to be dragged around by him on the Machine Kivaa. After shattering her, Castle Doran arrives to ingest the Octopus Fangire's soul as three figures are in one of its chambers, two playing a game of chess.",

However, Otoya's blundering interference allows Jiro to run off and feed on another victim. Seeing a link between the attacks, Otoya drinks as much coffee as humanly possible to test his theory and to also impress Yuri. While on her way home that night, Yuri confronts Basshaa of the Merman Race, believing him to be responsible for the attacks. When Basshaa was able to beat her, Jiro arrives and tells Basshaa not to harm the girl as the Merman questions Jiro's reasons while assuming his human form: Ramon. Soon after, Jiro encounters Yuri as she thanks him for saving her life with feelings of love. In 2008, Megumi is a bit upset of Wataru trusting Nago, revealing that he drove his father to suicide. When he asks of this truth, Nago reveals what really happened between him and his father.

Yuri pleads to use it so she can finally avenge her mother, who was murdered by a Fangire with a rook tattoo on his hand two years prior. Yuri's intent is intensified while she saves a young woman from the Earwig Fangire, only to be manhandled by him. Later, Yuri is accompanied by Otoya as they are ambushed by the Earwig Fangire in a garage, with Otoya knocked unconscious. But at the last second, Ixa arrives and destroys the Earwig Fangire as Yuri is confused to see Ixa to be Jiro. In 2008, Megumi visits Yuri's grave as Shima comforts her before she walks off. Meanwhile, pondering on what kind of violin he can make, Wataru meets a young guitarist named Kengo Eritate, whose music catches Wataru's attention. Kengo allows Wataru to borrow his bass guitar to learn how to play, as Kengo intends to draft Wataru into his new band \"Ikemens\" with Shizuka joining as the drummer.

But Shima, though he sympathizes, explains that Ixa is for all humanity and not a tool for one person's revenge. After Jiro states that he will keep the Ixa System, a maddened Yuri runs off in a huff with thoughts of quitting the Organization. Later, she finds Otoya and goes on a date with him, running him ragged before he leaves out of not liking Yuri's new attitude. Intent to get the Yuri he loves back, Otoya begs the Ixa from Jiro before Yuri arrives to beg for the Ixa System herself. After hearing Yuri's reasons, Jiro refuses to give Ixa to her as he collapses to Yuri and Otoya's shock. Once at the hospital, Shima reveals that Jiro's condition is the result of the Ixa prototype's flaws. Though still weak from the strain, Jiro pleads Yuri to aid him, intent on destroying the Fangire Race until the Ixa suit is perfected enough for Yuri herself to use. In 2008, after being injured in his fight against Ixa, Wataru washes up on shore where Ryo, the Spider Fangire, happens to be at. Ryo tries to kill Kiva while he was unconscious, but runs off in fright when Kiva starts to move before he loses consciousness. During this time, Nago reports his success at defeating Kiva to Shima, as well as suggest to recruit more Fangire Hunters to aid them.

Once Kiva arrives to fight the Spider Fangire, Nago becomes Ixa and joins the fray with the Spider Fangire running away. Though still injured, Kiva uses the Buroon Fuestle to summon Buroon, who combines with the Machine Kivaa to create Buroon Booster and battles Ixa along the highway. After being defeated by Kiva, Nago become mentally unstable. Later, with Megumi taking his place as the bass player, Wataru is made the lead singer of IKEMENS as he sings \"Destiny's Play.\"",

        "In 1986, after visiting Ramon and Riki to discuss their current issues as the last members of their respective kinds, Jiro tells them not to compare himself to them as he vows to restore the Wolfen Race to its former glory and rule the world. The next day, he is about to attack a young lady for nourishment when Otoya interferes, provoking Jiro to beat him to a bloody pulp before he witnesses Garulu devour the woman. Jiro laughs Otoya's insults off and reveals himself as the last of the Wolfen and his plans to make Yuri his mate to repopulate the world with his kind, infuriating Otoya. Otoya is nearly strangled by Jiro but reveals he had secretly lifted the Ixa Knuckle that Jiro dropped in the earlier beating. Transforming into Ixa in front of the shocked and angry Wolfen, Otoya vows that he will never let Jiro near Yuri again as he calmly beats a fighting-mad Garulu into submission; launching the Ixa Knuckle's Broken Fang attack at him. In 2008, after his defeat by Kiva, Nago becomes mentally disturbed to the point of brutally taking out his rage on a criminal named Yayoi Matsuda, and ends up being arrested himself. Meanwhile, after the IKEMENS band practice, Wataru visits Kengo's home to understand his dream to be a rock star. No sooner does Wataru leave, he encounters Tohru Miyake, a talent agent who witnessed the practice and offers Wataru a professional debut, only to be turned down and suggests Kengo to Miyake's annoyance. The next day, Kengo visits Wataru's place, though unimpressed with Wataru's dream until he is moved by him playing the Bloody Rose. Later, as he ponders his future, Kengo encounters Miyake who offers Kengo the big break he has been looking for, providing Kengo with some needed funding.

Later, when Otoya runs off into the woods so Yuri cannot see him in pain, Jiro arrives to take it back and offers a painless death. But Otoya refuses with intent to kill him instead as he and Jiro resume their fight to the death. But before Otoya can land the deathblow, Basshaa arrives to aid Garulu before Otoya finally collapses from the Ixa System's strain, with Garulu intent on taking advantage of Otoya's predicament. In 2008, Wataru aids Kengo in his part time job as a construction worker to provide the funding needed to launch Kengo's rock career. However, Megumi tells Wataru to quit this back-breaking job after learning that the people Miyake had been scouting have mysteriously disappeared, suggesting that he may be a Fangire. Though he pleads Kengo leave Miyake, Wataru only makes Kengo think he is jealous of his upcoming success and tells Wataru to leave. Deciding to take matters in his own hands, Wataru follows Miyake to his lair, finding the Dream Graveyard that is composed of pictures and items of his past victims, with Kengo to be Miyake's latest victim. Assuming his true form, Miyake beats Wataru to a bloody pulp until Kivat arrives. Vowing to make Miyake pay for his methods, Wataru becomes Kiva and fights the Rhinoceros Fangire, protecting Kengo from him. But when he is unable to handle the Fangire's brute strength, Kiva enlists the aid of his final Arms Monster, Dogga. Once he assumes Dogga Form, Kiva manages to overpower the Rhinoceros Fangire before destroying him so Castle Doran can feed on the Fangire's soul. While this all occurs, after bailing Nago from jail, Shima takes him to the site of Ixa's latest weapon: the Powered Ixer--a dinosaur-styled hovercraft vehicle."

        "In 1986, Jiro is forced to retreat after being unable to fight the Lion Fangire as both Garulu and as Ixa. In the aftermath, Yuri finds the Ixa Knuckle that Jiro had dropped to get her revenge as the Rook resumes his Time Play with a group of skateboarders. Waiting for Otoya to leave the hospital, Jiro reluctantly asks Otoya for them to work together to keep Yuri from the Lion Fangire, with Otoya agreeing to the one-time truce. After finding Yuri, who refuses their help, Otoya knocks her unconscious to ensure she does not get involved before Jiro takes the Ixa Knuckle. The two manage to find the Rook while he is in the middle of his Time Play for people with balloons, with Jiro going at the Rook as Ixa and losing as Otoya takes the Ixa Knuckle. But Yuri arrives during the fight as she gets her vengeance, enraging Otoya as he becomes Ixa so he and Garulu can double-team the Lion Fangire. However, the Fangire proves too strong for the two and is about to kill them when his watch goes off, forcing him to leave for his penalty. In 2008, though having the upper hand against Kiva in Garulu Form, the Lion Fangire is suddenly in pain and forced to retreat. Later, Wataru and Shizuka play with Dai chan before Eriko Hoteiya, the girl whose bike Dai-chan fixed, treats them to her family's restaurant where Dai-chan receives a job to help regain his memories. Though worried at first, Wataru sees that Dai-chan seems to be doing well, in both his job and his relation to Eriko. However, upon seeing a fountain, Dai-chan starts to regain a bit of his memory of a red tiled fountain, which Wataru found from Megumi's profiling unsolved cases from 1986. Once he is taken to the site where Jiro and Otoya fought the Lion Fangire, Dai-chan collapses from the pain as Eriko takes him away. However, Dai-chan fully awakens as the Rook and devours Eriko and everyone in her restaurant home as Wataru runs in. Though horrified, Wataru becomes Kiva and fights the Rook until the Lion Fangire summons a golden Sabbat to finish Kiva off for him. Though Kivat summons Castle Doran, it is tossed aside by the Powerd Ixer in its inaugural battle, destroying the Sabbat as Castle Doran devours Kiva and flies off.",

Though he refused at first, he accepts under the condition that Yuri goes on with him on a date. After reasoning with the spoiled girl over the fact they both have a lot to gain, Otoya treats her to the Caf\u00e9 mald'amour, having the girl scrub toilets to pay for both their meal and his overdue tabs.

Hearing the voices of the Arms Monsters as Jiro tells Ramon and Riki to let him live to honor their vow to Otoya, Wataru wakes up to find himself at his house but curious about his father's mentioning in his dream.

But Jiro refuses to accept the win and calls it a pocket match as Yuri arrives to scold Otoya for lying to Mami at the cafe, with the girl running off. After tailing Mami that she is in a slump because she does not perform from the heart, Otoya manages to convince her to go to the audition and play from the heart. With Yuri and Otoya watching her performance at her first audition, Mami wins the praise of her audience. Later, after learning that his outing with Mami and Yuri is the date with Yuri, Otoya's violin playing touches Mami as she admits she never wanted to play the violin. Otoya offers her his final teaching to do things one really wants to do: Listen to the voice in your heart. In 2008, just Ixa is about to kill him with the Garulu Saber, the Seastar Fangire's interference allows Kiva to escape with Nago losing it. The event also scarred Wataru as he no longer wants to fight the Fangires, almost smashing the Bloody Rose and forcing Kivat to attempt to head to the site himself were it not for his cold. But unknown to Wataru, Mami is being attacked by the Seastar Fangire with Megumi attempting to protect her until a maddened Nago arrives to get revenge on the Seastar Fangire. However, after the Fangire is forced into human form, Nago ends up being arrested by the police again with Sakaguchi's smirk the final straw, as Nago goes insane to the point of attacking the police to bust Sakaguchi out just to finally get a button from him. When Wataru goes to Mami after learning of the attack, he finds her practicing archery in spite of her injury. After giving him the very same advice Otoya gave her long ago, to listen to the voice in his heart, Wataru decides to follow his heart as the Bloody Rose reacts. The Seastar Fangire once again attacks Mami, with Kiva arriving to her aid. But with Kivat's cold, Kiva has a disadvantage against the Seastar Fangire, forcing him to summon all three of the Arms Monsters and trust his feelings to assume a new form: DoGaBaKi Form. After the Seastar Fangire's soul is devoured by Castle Doran, Mami resumes her archery with Wataru and Megumi watching as Wataru is unaware of Mami's relation to his father.",

With Yuri and Otoya watching her performance at her first audition, Mami wins the praise of her audience. Later, after learning that his outing with Mami and Yuri is the date with Yuri, Otoya's violin playing touches Mami as she admits she never wanted to play the violin. Otoya offers her his final teaching to do things one really wants to do: Listen to the voice in your heart. In 2008, just Ixa is about to kill him with the Garulu Saber, the Seastar Fangire's interference allows Kiva to escape with Nago losing it. The event also scarred Wataru as he no longer wants to fight the Fangires, almost smashing the Bloody Rose and forcing Kivat to attempt to head to the site himself were it not for his cold. But unknown to Wataru, Mami is being attacked by the Seastar Fangire with Megumi attempting to protect her until a maddened Nago arrives to get revenge on the Seastar Fangire. However, after the Fangire is forced into human form, Nago ends up being arrested by the police again with Sakaguchi's smirk the final straw, as Nago goes insane to the point of attacking the police to bust Sakaguchi out just to finally get a button from him. When Wataru goes to Mami after learning of the attack, he finds her practicing archery in spite of her injury. After giving him the very same advice Otoya gave her long ago, to listen to the voice in his heart, Wataru decides to follow his heart as the Bloody Rose reacts. The Seastar Fangire once again attacks Mami, with Kiva arriving to her aid. But with Kivat's cold, Kiva has a disadvantage against the Seastar Fangire, forcing him to summon all three of the Arms Monsters and trust his feelings to assume a new form: DoGaBaKi Form. After the Seastar Fangire's soul is devoured by Castle Doran, Mami resumes her archery with Wataru and Megumi watching as Wataru is unaware of Mami's relation to his father.",

        "In 1986, after attacking a woman for being rude to him, the Rook decides to target brides in their wedding dresses as part of his Time Play. However, Yuri was attending a wedding at time as the Rook crashes it, attempting to take her revenge as the Fangire spares her and simply walks off to Yuri's dismay. Later at the cafe, Yuri begs Jiro to give her the Ixa Knuckle to get her revenge, with Jiro refusing to her request as he wishes to kill the Rook himself. However, Otoya manages to dupe Jiro out of the Ixa Knuckle with a fake Susan Kumiko autograph. After giving the item to Yuri out of sympathy, she slugged him to keep him from interfering. Though she finds Rook, Yuri could not bring herself to use the Ixa System as the Rook simply walks past her again without a second glance. In 2008, while gathering snails with Shizuka for his latest varnish experiment, Wataru gets harassed by some bullies until Kengo arrives to the boy's aid. Later at the cafe, Kengo reveals that since his encounter with the Rhinoceros Fangire, he has became a fan of Kiva much to Nago's annoyance. When Megumi arrives, she and Kengo suggest that they find out who Kiva is much to Wataru's dismay and Nago's approval. To that end, the four go to a fortune teller who conducts a seance to track down Kiva. Before it can even start and reveal Kiva's secret, the fortune teller loses consciousness along with Wataru, who, upon waking up, starts acting more confident and eccentric to everyone's shock before returning to normal.

Kiva arrives and drives the Fangire away in Basshaa Form, but under the influence of another as the battle ended. The escaping Ladybug Fangire encounters Nago and Kengo, knocking the Ixa Knuckle out of Nago's hands as Megumi arrives to get it. However, Megumi was unable to bring herself to use the Ixa System as the Ladybug Fangire takes Nago and Kengo away as hostages, only to encounter Wataru who reveals that he is spiritually possessed from beyond the grave by his father, Otoya.",

        "In 1986, Otoya catches up to Yuri as she lies about bringing herself to use the Ixa System when she encountered the Rook earlier. However, when Otoya tries to find her at another wedding to assist her, he encounters a beautiful woman in black, Maya, before the Rook arrives to devour the bride, knocking Otoya out. Before the Rook could kill the bride, he is stopped by Maya, whom he knew as the Queen of the Checkmate Four. After telling the Rook to leave, Maya kills the bride herself after revealing her to be a Fangire who betrayed their kind by falling in love with a human. While this all had happened, Yuri only watched before running off in fear. Otoya found her and gave her a shoulder to cry on, much to Jiro's dismay. Meanwhile, Maya can be seen walking under a red moon, with a Kivat flying around her. In 2008, the Ladybug Fangire manages to escape the Otoya-possessed Wataru, taking both Nago and Kengo with him as his hostages to force Megumi to fight him as her leg was injured from the fight. \"Otoya\" arrives to teach Megumi how to overcome her anxiety, with Megumi refusing to listen to him. She was also confused of his knowledge of her mother's name and annoyed with Wataru's constant harassment. When he threatens to toss the Ixa Knuckle into a fire, and ultimately the Ixa system with it, Megumi manages to overcome her injuries before the device is incinerated. \"Otoya\" follows Megumi to where Nago and Kengo are being held, with Megumi holding her own against the Ladybug Fangire before releasing the hostages. Nago becomes Ixa as he and Megumi double-team the Ladybug Fangire. Wataru walks off and returns to normal. Once Ixa kills the Ladybug Fangire, his soul expands and transforms itself into a Sabbat. Upon witnessing the Sabbat, Wataru transforms into Kiva to summon Castle Doran as Ixa calls the Powerd Ixer, who promptly arrives. After a short wait, the dragon eventually emerges from beneath the ground and picks up Powerd Ixer to Ixa's shock as the Riders combine their attacks to shatter the Sabbat. Afterwards, as Wataru recuperates at home with no memory of his possession, he wonders who was making a violin in his workshop, amazed at the framework he did under Otoya's influence.",

After Taiga finishes a meeting with a young man named Numakawa, he sees Wataru and invite him out to dinner in order for him to meet his fiance. When Wataru finds out the fiance is Mio, Wataru is shocked as he gets down in the dumps that his girlfriend is seeing his best friend. Later after a talk with Nago, who wishes to know more about Maya, Mio arrives to explain that the engagement was arranged and she has no choice in the matter. But her words fall on deaf ears as Shizuka escorts Mio out, with the heart-broken girl running into Kurosawa who attempts to kill Mio when Taiga interferes, disowning the Fangire's aid for his attempt. The next day, clueless of the feelings of Wataru and Mio, Taiga helps Mio with a second chance to execute Numakuwa, who is a Fangire she let go in a previous confrontation. But Mio could not do it as the Tortoise Fangire runs into Kurosawa who attempts to clean up her mess just as Wataru arrives and fights the Moose Fangire. But as Kiva assumes Emperor Form and uses the Dogga Hammer to destroy the Moose Fangire, a weakened Numakuwa runs into Taiga who reveals himself as the new King of the Checkmate Four, Kamen Rider Saga, who slays the Tortoise Fangire with Kiva's insignia in the sky."

The two women resume their search for Otoya, whose Life Energy is being sucked out of him with Kivat-bat the 2nd keeping an eye on him. Otoya pleads with Kivat-bat the 2nd, making his final request to play his violin one last time. Using the violin music as a beacon, Maya and Yuri manage to make it in time as Maya and the King fight each other. While the escaping Otoya and Yuri are encountered by the Silkworm Fangire which Otoya destroys with the Ixa system, Dark Kiva defeats the Pearlshell Fangire as she finally admits that she does love Otoya, forcing the King to strip Maya of her Fangire title and powers as punishment for her betrayal. In 2008, Saga nearly kills Kiva but stops their fight due his younger brother being unable to fight back seriously. Shima, keeping what happened to him a secret, assigns Wataru to be his bodyguard against the Sungazer Fangire the Fangire Hunters presumed are hunting down. However, while on a jog, Shima suddenly runs off and becomes the Sungazer Fangire with Nago fighting him as Rising Ixa, exposing him as Shima, leaving everyone confused as he runs off. Confronting Taiga as Shima arrives, Wataru learns that Taiga saved his life by transplanting into the man's body a bit of Fangire power. Making a visit to the cafe, Shima is found by Nago who attempts to kill him on command, but couldn't do it. The next day, Shima apologizes to Wataru for his mistrust before running off as the Fangire power that's to manifest.

Finding Mio near death, Wataru receives the ring he gave her and places it on her finger before she crystallizes and shatters in his arms.",

However, Wataru decides to use this to alter the past by keeping Otoya and Maya apart, negating his own existence and thus saving Mio's life. Meanwhile, as a heartbroken Taiga vows that he will kill Wataru for taking Mio from him, Nago takes over the Blue Sky Organization for Shima's sake. Nago later runs into Bishop who sees him as the only remaining threat to the Fangire, defeating the Swallowtail Fangire as Rising Ixa before he escapes. In 1986, after being saved from the King by Yuri and Maya, Otoya leaves his hospital to save the Arms Monsters. However, Wataru in the guise of a doctor, advises him to stay in bed for a year. When that fails, Wataru assumes the guise of an old fortune teller, and warns Otoya that his life is in danger if he meets Maya, but he still does not believe it and recognizes him before Wataru is forced to run for it. When Yuri starts moving out of Otoya's house, she encounters Wataru as he tells her to express her feelings for Otoya, but she uses the date Wataru setup for her to end it properly between them. Later, the powerless Maya is targeted by the Polar Bear Fangire until Yuri saves her as Otoya arrives and she sets them up to Wataru's dismay, forced to reveal that he is Maya's and Otoya's child. Otoya still does not believe it and sees it as a Fangire plot, even after Wataru reveals the button he got from his mother. Once in his father's house, Wataru manages to convince Otoya that he is his son but not to help him. Wataru later is visited by Maya as the Polar Bear Fangire returns, when Kivat and Tatsulot arrive.

When Yuri starts moving out of Otoya's house, she encounters Wataru as he tells her to express her feelings for Otoya, but she uses the date Wataru setup for her to end it properly between them. Later, the powerless Maya is targeted by the Polar Bear Fangire until Yuri saves her as Otoya arrives and she sets them up to Wataru's dismay, forced to reveal that he is Maya's and Otoya's child. Otoya still does not believe it and sees it as a Fangire plot, even after Wataru reveals the button he got from his mother. Once in his father's house, Wataru manages to convince Otoya that he is his son but not to help him. Wataru later is visited by Maya as the Polar Bear Fangire returns, when Kivat and Tatsulot arrive. They hold off the monster's attack, giving Maya the chance to escape. However, as Wataru attempts to steal the Bloody Rose from Otoya to keep him from his date with Maya, the Polar Bear Fangire arrives to kill him for meddling as Wataru becomes Kiva Emperor Form with Kivat-bat the 2nd watching the change with Otoya joining in the fight as Ixa. After the father/son team shatters the Polar Bear Fangire, the two start to fight each other until the King arrives with an interest in the future Kiva, offering to help him by killing Otoya as Dark Kiva.",

However, Wataru decides to use this to alter the past by keeping Otoya and Maya apart, negating his own existence and thus saving Mio's life. Meanwhile, as a heartbroken Taiga vows that he will kill Wataru for taking Mio from him, Nago takes over the Blue Sky Organization for Shima's sake.

        "In 1986, during their brief encounter with Dark Kiva, Otoya is rescued by Wataru from the grips of King, only to invoke his wrath and reveal his true form as the Bat Fangire. Escaping the monster and later Wataru, Otoya encounters Kivat-bat the 2nd who delivers a message from Maya telling them they cannot meet again. She reveals that the King is using their son Taiga as leverage against her, vowing to kill the baby if she ever comes in contact with Otoya again. In light of his nemesis' cruel methods, Otoya offers to rescue Taiga; an equally disgusted Kivat-bat the 2nd proposes to enter a pact with him that would allow Otoya to use the power of Kiva, even though it would endanger the man's life. Wataru, who overhears the discussion, is requested by Maya to save Taiga; however, Otoya refuses to let Wataru something he wants to do. Overwhelmed by the situation, Wataru excuses himself only to encounter King, escalating into full-blown combat between the two Kivas, until Otoya arrives. The situation soon turns dire as Wataru is injured intercepting an attack meant for his father. Facing imminent danger, Otoya enters the pact with Kivat-bat the 2nd and becomes Dark Kiva and forces the King to retreat. With the Bat Fangire gone, Otoya is left to brave the pains of his pact, knocking Wataru unconscious. Found by Yuri, she offers advice to Wataru not to continue his plan as it would mean Mio would never know him. Finding Maya, Wataru learns that Otoya is making a rescue attempt to Castle Doran to save the Arms Monsters and Taiga. Once inside Castle Doran, Otoya manages to free the Arms Monsters, but he is discovered by King. Narrowly escaping, Wataru meets with Otoya in the manor's halls and is told the only way to honor Mio is to live a strong life for her. When the King finds them, Otoya covers for Wataru to find Taiga as he transforms into Dark Kiva to fight the Bat Fangire, freeing the Arms Monsters in the process. The Bat Fangire summons a red Sabbat to control Castle Doran, but Wataru assumes Emperor Form to free the dragon from the creature. Meanwhile, the battle between Otoya and the Bat Fangire reaches its climax as Otoya collapses from the strain of Kiva's power. In 2008, Taiga agonizes over his loss of Mio, with the Bishop only offering harsh words about his King's treasonous fianc\u00e9e\u2019s actions against their race, before revealing himself as Mio's true executioner and had allowed Wataru to take the blame so he would be too distraught to interfere in their affairs again. However, in spite of the Bishop's confidence that their kind would be unchallenged, Taiga turns his wrath towards him in a violent rage from which the Bishop barely escapes with his life. This act angers the Bishop as he starts attacking human to gather the necessary life energy to exact his revenge against Taiga for his unkingly behavior, only to be interrupted by Nago as he assumes Rising Ixa to stop the Swallowtail Fangire.",

After his father loses as Ixa and the Ixa Knuckle ends up in the river, Wataru continues the fight until Otoya becomes Dark Kiva despite Wataru and Maya's pleas. The two Kivas battle the Bat Fangire together with a terrified Maya watching. At first the King has the upper hand of the Kivas. But after realizing his father's passion and embracing his father's ideology, Wataru and his father defeat the King with a double Rider Kick. The wounded King attempts to kill Maya and Taiga before he dies, only for his attack to be reflected back at him by the infant. The King realizes that the title has changed hands, and vows that Taiga would avenge him before shattering to pieces. After the battle was over, Wataru begins to fade back into 2009, but not before a dying Otoya gives him final advice to make his own choices for a better tomorrow. Later, Otoya visits Yuri while she is looking for Buruman, asking her to teach him how to make an omrice and expressing his gratitude in having met her. He then finds the Arms Monsters with the masterless Castle Doran as they decide to enter the beast to keep it from causing trouble, asking the trio to do him a favor for everything he did for them by having them promise to protect his future son, Wataru.

        "In the present day (2009), Taiga and Wataru resume their battle to the death upon dispensing of the Fangires that the Bishop had revived. The two battle each other in both Rider and human forms; Wataru overpowers Taiga before walking off, tired of fighting him and telling him he will embrace his Fangire nature but not to help his older brother. As the Bishop has his Fangire army gather more Life Energy by the masses, Wataru helps Nago in supporting Megumi from a Fangire attack until they get unexpected support from Shima. After Shima reveals Nago's condition, Nago accepts the notion of resigning from the Wonderful Blue Sky Organization to Megumi's dismay as she offers to help him. Meanwhile, after losing his position as D&P's president due to his defeat by Kiva, a ruined Taiga later encounters the Bishop, who attempts to kill him with the aid of his minions. Nago and Megumi arrive to aid him with Megumi giving directions to Nago as to where to attack, but all three are defeated as Wataru arrives. He slays all the Fangires as Kiva, declaring himself as the Fangire King to everyone's shock. The Bishop is most offended by this and attempts an attack on Kiva, but is easily driven off as Taiga's mind snaps. Wataru later meets Shima who reveals that Taiga pretended to kill him and took him away to purge the Fangire energy from his body while being healed implying that Taiga had a degree of kindness within him. Elsewhere, a distraught Taiga demands the power of Dark Kiva from Maya; she refuses and Taiga seeming kills her out of rage to obtain the power of Dark Kiva to regain his title and birthright. As Wataru takes the throne of King to the Arms Monsters' dismay, Bishop is close to resurrecting the previous King, the Bat Fangire.",

        "After Wataru has proclaimed himself the new King of the Fangires, Taiga confronts him and claims to have killed their mother to acquire the powers of Dark Kiva. This drives Wataru to attack his half-brother, only to be interrupted by the Bishop and his new army of revived Fangires. With the Arms Monsters' aid, the Kivas dispatch of the Fangires before resuming their fight as the Bishop is stopped from meddling by Nago, who trained with Megumi to perfect their teamwork. As Rising Ixa, Nago initially is disadvantaged against the Swallowtail Fangire until his drive to succeed allows him to mortally wound the Fangire while regaining his vision. Though dying, the Bishop uses his own soul to complete the Bat Fangire's rebirth. While this occurred, Shima arrives and reveals to Taiga that Wataru took the title of King in order to save him from being a target. But the Bat Fangire uses this moment to attack, easily beating the two Kivas single-handily before throwing Wataru off a cliff. However, Wataru is saved by Otoya's spirit, telling his son that he lives on within him and not to give up. This encourages Wataru to muster the strength as he and Taiga combine their signature attacks to destroy the former King once and for all. Though the battle ended, Wataru and Taiga get a surprise visit by Maya, who revealed she was only knocked unconscious by Taiga. The reunion ends with the two brothers resuming their fight to determine who will be the new King. A few days later, as Taiga returns to D&P to begin a new venture to find an alternate means for the Fangire race to survive, Wataru attends Megumi's wedding to Nago. Just as Wataru prepares to play his violin for the newly weds, a young man resembling Otoya bursts into the reception. Calling himself Masao, he claims to be Wataru's son from 22 years in the future. He has come to get Wataru to help him fight the Neo-Fangire menace who have started to appear in 2009, showing up as a vortex in the sky above the church as Taiga arrives to the wedding late. Wataru, Nago, Taiga, Masao, Jiro, Ramon, and Riki transform into Emperor Form, Rising Ixa, Dark Kiva, New Kiva, Garulu, Basshaa, and Dogga to face this new threat.",

Besides this, it also provides an option to experimentally validate the predicted targets, on the spot, using expression data, which has been integrated in its back-end, to draw confidence on prediction along with SVR score.p-TAREF performance benchmarking has been done extensively through different tests and compared with other plant miRNA target identification tools. p-TAREF was found better performing.",
