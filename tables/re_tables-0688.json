        "Six months after the battle between the Dark Signers and the Signers, a large stone tablet falls (which is Machine Emperor Wisel Infinity's tablet) from space and lands on Earth, just outside of New Domino City. Whilst investigating it, Lazar encounters three people from Yliaster, who are Jakob (the leader), Lester (self-appointed sub-leader), and Primo (the lowest-ranking member). Lazar questions them about their intentions, but after being reminded by Primo that they were his leaders, and a brief outburst in which Primo points the tip of his sword at Lazar's neck, he quickly submits to the trio, and turns over the leadership of New Domino City to them. Then, Primo tells the other members of the trio that he was going to take his Machine Emperor out for a \"test drive.\" A day later, Sector Security investigates a turbo duelist named Ghost, who is attacking Turbo Duelists, and \"stealing\" their Synchro Monsters, at night. Jack, Yusei and Crow, meanwhile, are preparing for an upcoming tournament, the World Racing Grand Prix (WRGP), but when Trudge suggests Jack, Crow, and Yusei to help him take down the Ghost, Crow rejects Trudge's plea for assistance, in favor of working on their new engine, as he states that they have the Grand Prix to prepare for, and that they don't have any time to spare. Instead, Crow insists that Trudge and the rest of Sector Security, being the cops, go chase after the Ghost themselves. Trudge encounters Ghost later that night, but is defeated and severely injured. He warns Yusei not to use Synchro Monsters against Ghost, as \"Synchros are useless.\" After the incident, Crow feels guilty about what he told Trudge. After Yusei tells him that blaming himself was not going to work, Crow asks Yusei what he should do, to which Yusei replies that they go find and beat the Ghost. Yusei, Jack and Crow then go and search for Ghost, who Yusei soon encounters after several hours of riding.

        "Yusei's landlord, Zora, is depressed because the city wants to replace the broken cuckoo clock on her clock repair shop. Later, the gang are visited by Zora's son, Lynden, who has returned after three years of training to fix the clock. When he goes to see Zora again, she is not happy to see him, since he was the one who broke the clock in the first place. Before he can run off, Crow challenges him to a duel, forcing him to apologize if he won. Crow runs into a bit of trouble with Lynden absorbing one of his monsters and summoning out his Clock Knight monsters that rely on coin tosses, but soon comes back with his Blackwing Armor Master. Lynden tries to back off from the duel, but Crow tells him he needs to stop running away from his problems. Lynden summons a Time Wizard he got from his late father to destroy Crow's monster. Crow decides to take the damage instead of activating his Mirror Force, since Lynden had realized he can't keep running away regardless of his victory.

The Alchemist Warriors, using Shosei's buso renkin, fly into space in order to retrieve Kazuki. Victor decides to send Kazuki back to Earth with the use of his buso renkin. Kazuki, seeing the good in Victor, drags him back to Earth. Papillon, using his white kakugane, restores Kazuki's humanity and the two begin their long awaited duel. The Alchemist Warriors are able to create another white kakugane and restore Victor back into a human. Victor asks them to turn him into a Homunculus and that he will lead all the Homunculi to the moon until they find a way to revert Homunculi back into humans.

Leo temporarily gains the upper hand by summoning Power Tool Dragon, but is then defeated by Sayer's Synchro Monster and is knocked unconscious by his psychic abilities."

Yusei's life points get reduced to 1 too, before he summons his Stardust Dragon and takes advantage of the traps Crow and Jack placed beforehand. As Yusei tries to reach Goodwin, which he successfully does, he regains the Signers' marks from him. Furthermore, Yusei gains Roman's mark of the Dragon Head, and the mark of the Tail that Yusei used to have transfers over to Crow. Yusei then takes the marks of the other 4 Signers, and gains the Seal of the Crimson Dragon. Then, he summons the Majestic Star Dragon and destroys Earthbound Immortal Wiraqocha Rasca, which defeats Goodwin. Then, the Crimson Dragon envelops the Majestic Star Dragon, infusing it with the power of the Crimson Dragon, and dives into the King of the Netherworld. Yusei then sees a vision where he and the Goodwin brothers are inside the King of the Netherworld, and he sees all of the Dark Signers lying unconscious, floating in mid-air. The moment before the King of the Netherworld is destroyed, Rex Goodwin tells Yusei that he was successful in reaching him, and tells him to take care of the other Dark Signers, as they will be sent back to Earth. The Goodwin brothers decide to sacrifice themselves, so that the other Dark Signers can be revived. The King of the Netherworld explodes, the Altar of the Dragon Star (Rex Goodwin's dueling platform) is dissolved, and the Geoglyph duel tracks disappear, which causes Jack and Crow to fall.

        "Goodwin reduces Jack's life points to 1, and gets the King of the Netherworld to attack him, causing him to crash. Yusei's life points get reduced to 1 too, before he summons his Stardust Dragon and takes advantage of the traps Crow and Jack placed beforehand. As Yusei tries to reach Goodwin, which he successfully does, he regains the Signers' marks from him. Furthermore, Yusei gains Roman's mark of the Dragon Head, and the mark of the Tail that Yusei used to have transfers over to Crow. Yusei then takes the marks of the other 4 Signers, and gains the Seal of the Crimson Dragon. Then, he summons the Majestic Star Dragon and destroys Earthbound Immortal Wiraqocha Rasca, which defeats Goodwin. Then, the Crimson Dragon envelops the Majestic Star Dragon, infusing it with the power of the Crimson Dragon, and dives into the King of the Netherworld. Yusei then sees a vision where he and the Goodwin brothers are inside the King of the Netherworld, and he sees all of the Dark Signers lying unconscious, floating in mid-air. The moment before the King of the Netherworld is destroyed, Rex Goodwin tells Yusei that he was successful in reaching him, and tells him to take care of the other Dark Signers, as they will be sent back to Earth.

They didn't want to do another typical barn conversion, so they decided to build their \"house\" inside instead. A helical stairway leads to a suspended curved walkway, with master bedroom on one side and the children bedrooms on the other. The kitchen is in an adjacent stable block, which was integrated into the main building. The house is also packed with computer wiring a central stereo system and ambient lighting system consisting of 188 lights. Everywhere you look curves interplay with straight lines. The result is a beautiful mixture of new and old, exquisitely finished in detail.",

They used to live in an apartment on the second floor of a former Victorian hotel. But three years ago, James bought the top floor flat. It was originally built as a solarium for the hotel in the 1920s where holiday-makers could soak up the sun. Now James and Katrin plan to convert it into a modern, luxury penthouse. The first project was to build a large rooftop extension which became the main living area of the new penthouse.
