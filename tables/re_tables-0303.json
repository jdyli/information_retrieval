Minutes later the man whose pocket was picked, Henri Bazaine, is found dead. Later, just before Patric meets up with Sara he notices a man who he suspects is a detective and so he slips away unnoticed. The man follows Sara and it turns out he is an assassin who killed Bazaine and knows that Sara saw him sitting next to Bazaine. Suddenly Golgo shows up and saves Sara and beats up the assassin. Patric is found by the assassin and is beaten into revealing Sara's location as the wallet contained a memo. Having located Sara, he chases after her but once again she is saved by Golgo. The assassin contacts his client, Carnac, but Golgo kills the assassin having let Carnac know where Sara will be. Golgo takes Sara to a hotel and Carnac appears, and Golgo kills him.

Bazaine was to deliver the memo containing the key to the project that could turn it into a contagion but as he was unable to he was killed.

Much to their chagrin, they bump into Kazuki and Juubei. Kazuki brought Juubei to the healing springs bath in order to heal his eyes, due to being blinded in their fight in the Limitless Fortress. Juubei asks Ginji to train with him in the mountains, to test his powers, later revealed to be his poor comedic skills. Kazuki explains Emishi teased for being unfunny and that would not help Makubex. Juubei decides to leave to \"train\" some more. At the ladies' hot springs bath, Natsumi and Hevn cry out, as they had a wristwatch stolen from them. Ban and Ginji pursue the thief, only to find out that the jewelry has been taken by a pack of monkeys. Ban and Ginji engage in combat against the monkeys, and it seems as though Ban and Ginji struggle to defeat them."

Riko then tells them that it was empty from the start, as it was one of Riko's friends that threw the briefcase in the garbage. Although, in the briefcase, a disk is contained. Sasakida returns with a group of men in black, who demand to return the disk to them. Riko is taken hostage by the men in black, who then are summarily defeated by The GetBackers.

The GetBackers forgive his acts of crime and return the disk to Mr. Sasakida. Akabane and Riko befriend each other, as they exchange email addresses. Kazuki, Shido, and Himiko chase Ban and Ginji down for involving them with Riko.",

Meanwhile, Ryuu eagerly anticipates the art auction as he expects to earn a lot of money from it, and plans to use the Aphrodite to someday rule the world. Hera looks back to when Ginji said that anything lost can always be recovered, even her happiness. Ban faces off with Akabane, both using their full power. Shido fights Shakuryuu, who wields thick fists of flames. Emishi gets into it Hyouku, who wields a thin sword of ice. Shakuryuu and Hyouku increase their strength and speed, however, Shido and Emishi manage to defeat them. Ginji runs into Yukihiko and Natsuhiko, who later turn out to be one and the same person with dissociative identity disorder, displaying a split personality. Yukihiko, in excellence of speed, is Miroku's friendly, reasonable side, while Natsuhiko, in excellence of strength is Miroku's evil, and bloodthirsty personality. Natsuhiko uses his sword to battle Ginji head-on, but Ginji seemingly defeats him. However, Yukihiko emerges again, using his ring blade to create a massive implosion of the structure around them."

It turns out that the implosion Miroku created using his ring blade was actually an explosion Ginji created amplifying the electricity using nearby electrical wires. The disturbance causes a minor power outage at the art auction. Hera reminisces about when Kait expresses his love for the beauty of the Venus de Milo, and then she makes her way to the art auction. It is revealed that Ban sneaks in the art auction as a television reporter. He uses Jagan on the male bidders, by means of a television screen, causing them all to see multiple sculptures, all with different hand gestures, diverted from all the female bidders.

Soon they realize that they must dump any unnecessary weight, and Ginji accidentally tosses the real arms of the sculpture as well as the replica sculpture overboard. Although the team acquired five hundred thousand yen, Clayman charges them three hundred thousand yen for the special balloons she made for Ban, and they already used two hundred thousand yen for preparations, so once again the team turn up penniless.

Heartbroken and touched, Hera reunites with Kait and puts aside her anger. Finally, Ban runs into Ryuu again, who is carrying a briefcase full of Aphrodite in order to make a comeback.

After that doesn't work out, Natsumi and Emishi decide to camp out in front of the house, waiting for the right time to sneak in.

Emishi runs off to a convenience store to buy food for the two of them, while Natsumi sees that the jewel thieves leave the house. Later in the evening, after being impatient for Emishi, she runs into the house, but is caught by the trap of the jewel thieves.

        "Ban and Ginji go to the beach, supposedly on a business trip, though it seems to be a vacation trip. Meanwhile in the Honky Tonk cafe, an old woman shows up, asking to retrieve a memento of her deceased husband. She explains to Natsumi that she hid her memento in her house from her son, as it was embarrassing to display it. She lost it, and had moved in with her son in his house. She had sold her house to a group of jewel thieves, later recognized, who disregard her presence from time to time, as they ignore her story about the memento. Natsumi decides to accept the case, and Paul is in shock. Natsumi makes her way to Madoka's house, but is disappointed that Shido wasn't there with her.

Ban and Ginji chase the monkey into a nearby forest, but they eventually lose sight of it. Ginji finds the food, only to find out it was a trap. They soon find themselves surrounded by monkeys. They figure out the monkey were the same ones who had stolen all the jewelry in the hot springs bath from before. As they return to see Natsumi, unable to retrieve the food, the same monkey, who just so happens to be the boss monkey, deliberately starts eating the food right in front of them. Natsumi explains that she prepared their favorite meals for them, as the boss monkey continues to eat. Ban and Ginji break into tears, chasing the boss monkey, but to no avail. When they arrive at the summer house, they explained the story to Shido, who was indifferent on the matter. They later explained the story to Madoka, as she asks Shido to help them with this situation. Shido witnesses that the monkeys are eating food from the customers of a nearby food stand. The monkeys run away, and Shido chases them to the nearby forest where all of them are. Shido then meets the boss monkey. He orders all of the monkeys to sleep, however the boss monkey stays awake. Shido and the boss monkey face off in a head-on collision, with the boss monkey being defeated. The rest of the monkeys surround Shido, as they bow down to him. Meanwhile, Ban and Ginji drive back, as they encounter the boss monkey again, taking their food again. They chase the monkey to the nearby forest again, setting off the same trap. They see that Shido is the leader of the pack of monkeys, and that he has the food. As he tastes the first bite, he perceived the food as poisonous.

Azuma, later recognized, enters the Honky Tonk cafe, as he was an old acquaintance of Paul. Azuma asks Paul if he is able to obtain an item from Sakai, also later recognized. However, Azuma said he will return later on. Ban and Ginji were discussing about a band of thieves for hire who lived near a harbor, and they disbanded after a failed mission. It is later revealed that the band of thieves were Paul, Azuma, and Sakai. In a flashback, it is seen that Paul, Azuma, and Sakai are hired to steal a antique vase. However, Sakai betrayed Paul and Azuma by joining the mafia. They run for their lives, but Azuma is shot and falls into the ocean, supposedly being dead. In the present, Paul and Azuma need Ban and Ginji's help to reclaim the stolen antique vase from Sakai. Nevertheless, Ban rejects the case, and Ginji tries to talk him out of his decision. After Paul admits his mistake of being part of a band of thieves, Ban accepts the case, under the condition of relieving the tab. The four of them infiltrate the mafia mansion, getting past the mafia guards outside. Azuma disarms the security system of the mansion, which made Ginji impressed. They eventually find the antique vase. Paul carefully plans out the robbery of the antique vase, but Azuma sets off the security alarm, demanding to see Sakai. The four of them are in the custody of the mafia guards, and Sakai makes his way in to see them.
