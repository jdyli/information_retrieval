Piper feels that being witches is stopping her sisters from having the life they want, and advises them to move out and follow their hearts. Bianca is revealed to actually be Chris' fianc\u00e9e who only came back as \"he\" would have sent someone else if she hadn't come and she wants to bring him back alive. Bianca is revealed to have helped Chris come back in time in the first place and apparently met him after the unnamed evil that rules their future sent her to kill him. Chris also reveals some of the truth about himself after Piper tries to freeze him and Bianca and fails: he's not a true Whitelighter, he's half-Whitelighter, half-witch like Paige and Wyatt. Bianca strips his powers and brings him back to his terrible future where the evil who rules it confronts Chris and Bianca alone: an evil Future Wyatt. Future Wyatt tries to convince Chris to join him, offering to spare his life if he does, saying that if Chris were anyone else, he wouldn't offer him that. Chris refuses and Wyatt tries to kill him, but he's saved by Bianca who switches back to his side to protect him. Using a spell the sisters left in the attic in the present, Chris reclaims his powers and defeats Wyatt temporarily, but Bianca is mortally wounded and dies, but not before telling him to finish what they started and change the future. Chris manages to open a time portal and escapes as Wyatt recovers, taking the spell with him so that Wyatt can't send another assassin back in time. In the present, the sisters forgive him and he remains their Whitelighter, but he swears that if he can't prevent Baby Wyatt from becoming evil, then he will stop him permanently.",

Bianca strips his powers and brings him back to his terrible future where the evil who rules it confronts Chris and Bianca alone: an evil Future Wyatt. Future Wyatt tries to convince Chris to join him, offering to spare his life if he does, saying that if Chris were anyone else, he wouldn't offer him that.

Chris manages to open a time portal and escapes as Wyatt recovers, taking the spell with him so that Wyatt can't send another assassin back in time. In the present, the sisters forgive him and he remains their Whitelighter, but he swears that if he can't prevent Baby Wyatt from becoming evil, then he will stop him permanently.",

A huge disaster ensues as Leo tells Piper just as she is adding touchy ingredients to a potion cauldron, which then blows up. Successive events rapidly spool out of control as if Leo's nightmare include both other sisters and Agent Kyle, and suddenly Leo inadvertently rewinds time the few moments that have elapsed, a foreshadowing of what is about to be the main episode. Alpha and Beta appear at that moment and freeze subjective time. In a frozen interval he is taken to task by Alpha and Beta and once again they attempt to dissuade him from revealing he's become an avatar to Piper. He stubbornly maintains Piper will be able to handle it, as she's been pestering him to stop hiding something so that he is adamant to reveal the truth to benefit their mending marital relationship. All three sisters have some trouble with the news leading to Phoebe and Paige calling on Kyle for help, but his reaction to the news causes disastrous results. Most of the episode is then erased as the Avatars take Leo to task but allow time to be rewound to before Leo tells Piper.

As a result of his death, the Avatars include the Charmed Ones in the sleep spell so they can't interfere.",
        "While the Avatars prepare to transform the world into a Utopia, the Charmed Ones work overtime eliminating demons as part of the alliance. Kyle remains skeptical and quarrels with Paige stimulating questions in which they inform the Charmed Ones that the human world must be put to sleep so that they can kill any remaining demons. Although Kyle now knows the Avatars didn't murder his parents, he still doubts their good intentions. He calls the Elders for help but is instead kidnapped by Zankou. In order to convince Kyle to help him stop the Avatars, Zankou summons and vanquishes the demons who murdered Kyle's parents. In return, Kyle reluctantly agrees to help Zankou stop the change by placing a paranoia spell on Piper, Phoebe and Paige. During the Utopian transformation, Kyle uses Paige's paranoia to lure and kill an Avatar. However, he pays a high price for his actions as he's killed by Beta as he kills her. As a result of his death, the Avatars include the Charmed Ones in the sleep spell so they can't interfere."

        "The Charmed Ones are in a race against time when the mythological Pandora's Box falls into the hands of Katya, a shape shifting demon who intends to open the box and fill the world with all of the evils, illnesses, diseases, sorrows and toils contained within. Phoebe and Piper try to find Hope, the Guardian who can return any released evils to the box. Meanwhile, Paige's Whitelighter side starts to grow stronger and she is able to hear the Elder's call. At Leo and an Elder named Sandra's suggestion, Paige is sent to save a future Whitelighter and gets trapped in an elevator with people she has to save. She does so and returns home in time to help out. Using her new Whitelighter powers, Paige disguises herself as Hope and tricks Kataya. Paige vanquishes her, saves Hope's friend Darcy and sends her home with Pandora's Box where Hope is able to return all of the sorrows to where they belong. Paige meets with Sandra who reveals that Paige herself was the future Whitelighter she was meant to save and says that Paige has proved she can handle Whitelighter duties as well as Charmed ones. Sandra tells her that being a Whitelighter can be very fulfilling for her and suggests to Paige that perhaps being a Whitelighter is the life separate from magic she was looking for.",

Max then brings the people he believes that are not his parents to the Lightman Group to be monitored to see if they were telling the truth. The parents are outraged at the boy's allegations and leave. Lightman and Foster then go to the parents of the missing child, but the mom seems to be lying and the mom admits to accidentally killing the baby James.
