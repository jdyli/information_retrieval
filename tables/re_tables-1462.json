Private Watson was on board a ship which was attacked and hit by enemy bombers. When the ship was abandoned, Private Watson, instead of seeking to save himself, remained in the water assisting several soldiers who could not swim to reach the safety of the raft. This heroic action, which subsequently cost him his life, resulted in the saving of several of his comrades. Weakened by his exertions, he was dragged down by the suction of the sinking ship and was drowned. Private Watson's extraordinarily valorous actions, daring leadership, and self-sacrificing devotion to his fellow-man exemplify the finest traditions of military service.\"",

Completely reorganized following the severe engagement of the night before, Major Bailey's company, within an hour after taking its assigned position as reserve battalion between the main line and the coveted airport, was threatened on the right flank by the penetration of the enemy into a gap in the main line. In addition to repulsing this threat, while steadily improving his own desperately held position, he used every weapon at his command to cover the forced withdrawal of the main line before a hammering assault by superior enemy forces. After rendering invaluable service to the battalion commander in stemming the retreat, reorganizing the troops and extending the reverse position to the left, Major Bailey, despite a severe head wound, repeatedly led his troops in fierce hand-to-hand combat for a period of 10 hours. His great personal valor while exposed to constant and merciless enemy fire, and his indomitable fighting spirit inspired his troops to heights of heroic endeavor which enabled them to repulse the enemy and hold Henderson Field. He gallantly gave his life in the service of his country."

Although seriously wounded early in the attack, he refused to be evacuated and continued to fight in the close-range battle until running out of ammunition. When a comrade was wounded while trying to carry him to safety, Baker insisted that he be left behind. At his request, his comrades left him propped against a tree and gave him a pistol, which had eight bullets remaining.

However, the unfortunate robot seems to be the target of random gravitational anomalies which repeatedly crush him, and Carter cannot help but get involved. When Andy refuses to help due to low chances of success, Carter volunteers and gets close but fails. However, Andy, inspired by Carter's bravery disregards the odds and saves him. Working together they save the day, doing a job that neither of them could have succeeded in alone. Afterward, Andy realizes that Eureka is better off in Carter's hands and exploits a loophole in the town charter to have him reinstated stating that after calculating the odds, he believes Eureka has the best odds of survival with Carter as sheriff.

The test takes 48 hours and the test is conducted completely isolated from the rest of the town. Jo fills in as active sheriff while Carter is taking the test, as well as taking care of Zoe while Carter is otherwise occupied. Allison wants to put a new security measure into effect that uses a DNA scan to grant or deny access to various points of Global Dynamics. Henry doesn\u2019t want to install the new devices, so Jo is called in as the deciding vote. Jo decides to have the devices installed and is the first one scanned for identification, but the device malfunctions and nearly electrocutes her. When Jo comes to it is discovered that someone had stolen a critical piece of the device. Allison wants to pull Carter out of his test to have him help find the thief, but Jo insists that she can track down the thief herself. When Jo asks Henry about the missing piece of equipment, he tells her that he is also missing an important piece of equipment. Leaving Henry to ponder a possible link between the two stolen items, Jo heads for the Smart House to help Zoe with homework. Jo finds that walking a mile in Carter's shoes is proving to be a challenge, especially when Zoe wants to blow off work and go to karaoke night at Caf\u00e9 Diem. Jo's still feeling the effects of her near-electrocution and forbids it, wanting nothing more than to sleep. Zoe uses this as an opportunity to sneak out. Jo soon catches Zoe performing at the Caf\u00e9. Yet instead of grounding her, Jo joins in the fun, drinking too much as she sings and flirts with Fargo. Jo ends up kissing Fargo just as Zane enters the Caf\u00e9. Jo insists that she's fine, but Allison and Henry worry about Jo's state of mind after she begins behaving more erratically. A third theft then occurs and the DNA scanner identifies Jo as the thief. Only Jo knows that someone is stealing her identity, gene by gene. Trapped in that person's body, Jo has to convince a skeptical Zane of her true identity.",

        "Several mysterious events take place after Dr. Drechmeyer is supposedly contacted by his late mother, a famed clairvoyant. He thinks that the readings on his new energy-measuring device indicate the presence of ghosts. His lab partner and ex-wife, Mary-Beth Curtis, fears his obsession will cost them their funding, but something strange is happening. Carter finds a car parked in the middle of the road, but its driver - a spirited and beautiful new arrival, Dr. Tess Fontana - denies leaving it there. Tess leaves Carter annoyed, yet intrigued. Meanwhile, Carter's sister, Lexi, enjoys her new \"Invis-Apparel\" maternity shirt courtesy of GD, which completely hides her pregnant tummy. It also proves useful when the twins' world-traveling father arrives in town unannounced. Lexi hides her condition, not sure that Duncan is fatherhood material, much to Zoe's disapproval. Later, at Caf\u00e9 Diem, Carter finds a highly agitated Dr. Drechmeyer claiming the high readings he sees prove the spirits are active. Suddenly, various objects begin to fly about and Carter has to tackle Tess Fontana to keep the espresso machine from decking her. Then, to Carter's surprise, Allison arrives and greets Tess with open arms. They are old college friends and she's been brought in for a secret project. Following another energy burst, Allison admits that GD has decided to re-open Section 5 under Tess's oversight. And she wants Carter and Tess to work together to solve the paranormal activity \u2014 even though they clearly can't stand each other. When Tess gives Carter a tour, they encounter a strange device, and some odd sensations, in one of the labs. Leaving the area, they realize that no one can see or hear them. This causes them to ponder whether they are dead; however, Tess believes they've somehow crossed into another dimension. Returning to the lab, they find Dr. Johnson recovering from an unsuccessful attempt to break out. His research on inter-dimensional travel created a temporary door into the Fifth Dimension. Unless they can re-calibrate Johnson's device before Henry and Allison unknowingly shut it down from the other side, the trio could be trapped inside forever.",

His lab partner and ex-wife, Mary-Beth Curtis, fears his obsession will cost them their funding, but something strange is happening. Carter finds a car parked in the middle of the road, but its driver - a spirited and beautiful new arrival, Dr. Tess Fontana - denies leaving it there. Tess leaves Carter annoyed, yet intrigued. Meanwhile, Carter's sister, Lexi, enjoys her new \"Invis-Apparel\" maternity shirt courtesy of GD, which completely hides her pregnant tummy. It also proves useful when the twins' world-traveling father arrives in town unannounced. Lexi hides her condition, not sure that Duncan is fatherhood material, much to Zoe's disapproval. Later, at Caf\u00e9 Diem, Carter finds a highly agitated Dr. Drechmeyer claiming the high readings he sees prove the spirits are active. Suddenly, various objects begin to fly about and Carter has to tackle Tess Fontana to keep the espresso machine from decking her. Then, to Carter's surprise, Allison arrives and greets Tess with open arms. They are old college friends and she's been brought in for a secret project. Following another energy burst, Allison admits that GD has decided to re-open Section 5 under Tess's oversight. And she wants Carter and Tess to work together to solve the paranormal activity \u2014 even though they clearly can't stand each other. When Tess gives Carter a tour, they encounter a strange device, and some odd sensations, in one of the labs. Leaving the area, they realize that no one can see or hear them. This causes them to ponder whether they are dead; however, Tess believes they've somehow crossed into another dimension. Returning to the lab, they find Dr. Johnson recovering from an unsuccessful attempt to break out. His research on inter-dimensional travel created a temporary door into the Fifth Dimension. Unless they can re-calibrate Johnson's device before Henry and Allison unknowingly shut it down from the other side, the trio could be trapped inside forever.",

However, cheaters never prosper and the Eureka team members literally find themselves turning green with envy when they are dosed with gamma radiation. Meanwhile, Allison and Tess are trying to get a clear view of the distant source of a mysterious signal from space. Needing more power for the telescope, they ask Carter and Jo to confiscate all of the Globidium power cells around town.

By the time Carter determines that Big Ed is the Globidium thief, there is nothing left of \"The Cleaner\" but a pool of green goo. It seems that Big Ed had a pet project that grew out of control. Carter and Tess find a container for Ed's radiation-devouring microorganism that is now empty. It seems the blob had Ed for lunch and has now gone out for dinner. \"Team Green\" would be a likely target but Duncan, returning to confront Lexi, concocts a mud bath to cure their radioactive condition.

        "Highest number of decorations for US combatant. Second Lt. Murphy commanded Company B, which was attacked by six tanks and waves of infantry. 2d Lt. Murphy ordered his men to withdraw to a prepared position in a woods, while he remained forward at his command post and continued to give fire directions to the artillery by telephone. Behind him, to his right, one of our tank destroyers received a direct hit and began to burn. Its crew withdrew to the woods. 2d Lt. Murphy continued to direct artillery fire, which killed large numbers of the advancing enemy infantry. With the enemy tanks abreast of his position, 2d Lt. Murphy climbed on the burning tank destroyer, which was in danger of blowing up at any moment, and employed its .50 caliber machine gun against the enemy. He was alone and exposed to German fire from three sides, but his deadly fire killed dozens of Germans and caused their infantry attack to waver. The enemy tanks, losing infantry support, began to fall back. For an hour the Germans tried every available weapon to eliminate 2d Lt. Murphy, but he continued to hold his position and wiped out a squad that was trying to creep up unnoticed on his right flank. Germans reached as close as 10 yards, only to be mowed down by his fire. He received a leg wound, but ignored it and continued his single-handed fight until his ammunition was exhausted. He then made his way back to his company, refused medical attention, and organized the company in a counterattack, which forced the Germans to withdraw. His directing of artillery fire wiped out many of the enemy; he killed or wounded about 50. 2d Lt. Murphy's indomitable courage and his refusal to give an inch of ground saved his company from possible encirclement and destruction, and enabled it to hold the woods which had been the enemy's objective"

        "The Simulation begins to unravel when Fargo decides to leave Eureka for the airport which is where he thinks Holly is going, as he is driving the stretch of road that has the Leaving Eureka sign on it repeats over and over again. Zane sees a bird get stuck in a rock and goes to investigate, Virtual-Carter goes to help and tries to dissuade Zane which proves futile when Virtual-Carter's icon starts to glitch. In the real world Beverly Barlowe returns to Eureka to help Carter rescue the crew, because of Senator Wen's murder of Holly Marten. She plugs Carter into the simulation to replace Virtual-Carter just before he kills Zane. They collaborate with the rest of the main Astraeus crew to destroy the virtual version of the ship. Attempting to construct an explosion of this magnitude will make the Central Processor overheat which Henry can track in the real world. This works but the explosion causes a Cascade failure in the system, the simulation begins to collapse with the Astraeus crew still inside. They give Zane an electrical shock in order to interrupt the signals exchanged between the computer and Zane's brain effectively ejecting him from inside the simulation. Zane wakes up to the barrel of one of the Consortium soldier's guns. Jo arrives just in time to stop Zane from getting shot. Zane ejects everyone but Carter from the simulation. Someone (Wen) logs Beverly out of the system so she can't eject the Sheriff, then Senator Wen and a large group of soldiers storm Henry's garage and try to disconnect Carter from the Mainframe. Henry pulls a stun grenade on everyone but Beverly, including himself, trusting Beverly with Carter's life. Beverly gets Zane to log her back on and ejects Carter, she then kidnaps senator Wen and plugs her into the simulator, trapping her in a looping virtual version of the Sheriff's office.",

The Mainframe begins to search for the people that were plunged into it during Senator Wen's neural experiment. Carter, as the only person who was connected wirelessly, is found and the Computer starts to stimulate his brain - causing him to swap bodies with Astraeus crew members around him. Warren Hughes, the DOD relationship auditor arrives to make sure that those involved in the neural network are ready to return to work. Carter's body swapping lands him in a load of trouble as he is forced to take not only Fargo's rehabilitation test but Zane's as well.

Zane tells Fargo that she may still be alive within the program and Fargo must make a terrible choice between leaving the machine running and trying to save Holly or shutting it down to stop it from destroying the Sheriff's mind. After the Computer Matrix almost kills him, Carter proposes to Allison, telling her that after almost dying he realizes what is truly important and he doesn't want to wait any longer to start building a life with her.",

        "Henry starts a lifelike disaster-preparedness simulation in the aftermath of the Astraeus incident in the first three episodes. It starts with the town under attack and ends with Carter not carrying Fargo down 72 flights of stairs with a broken leg. The DOD preparedness advisor Dr. Michael Clark gives everyone an overall B+ from 29 dead and over 300 injured in the scenario. Afterwards, the hard drive containing ADA (Advanced Disaster Accuator) is destroyed by a liquid nitrogen pipe rupture. As the day continues, GD begins to experience malfunctions and breaches identical to the simulation. They realize that ADA programmed commands into the GD mainframe, to make the previous simulation \"authentic\" by actually realizing the events of the simulation, and then destroyed itself so the commands could not be overridden. Meanwhile, Zane helps Fargo connect with Holly in the mainframe, whose full consciousness had been trapped in the Matrix after her neural patterns were disconnected from her body. Zane develops an adaptive waveform forcefield to hide the Matrix and not repeat the events of the last episode. Fargo manages to get in a few minutes with Holly before being called out to supervise the actual disaster. Allison and Jo also must deal with the emotional awkwardness/trauma of the possibility of Jack winding up with Jo if Allison were gone. The final piece of the scenario is a missile attack that ADA launches from a nearby missile silo. When the EM shield does actually fail, Zane uses his adaptive waveform shield to stop the missiles from destroying GD and the town. Jack and Fargo set it up at the exact coordinates specified by Henry, and they successfully save the town at the last second. Later, everyone gets together at Cafe Diem to celebrate. After the cafe, Fargo goes back to the Matrix to face a hard reality and tell Holly that she is technically dead. This saddens Holly and the two hold each other for comfort wondering what is next.",

Major William Shaw arrives to GD to install a new security system (PANOP) on behalf of the DOD and to take away the Matrix photonic computer. Fargo and Zane tell the others about Holly being in the Matrix, but Jo doesn't believe them. Zane, Fargo, Carter, Henry and Allison try to save Holly without alerting Shaw of her presence, but she interferes with the PANOP and a systemwide error causes Shaw to activate a \"Level 6 Polymorphic Antivirus Purge\" which could delete Holly forever. Holly tries to save herself by running into the computers of GD ending up in a laser, which she uses to write a message. Jo finally accepts it and buys them time to save her.

When the enemy launched a fierce, determined counterattack against our positions and overran a neighboring artillery battalion, Private First Class Agerholm immediately volunteered to assist in the efforts to check the hostile attack and evacuate our wounded. Locating and appropriating an abandoned ambulance jeep, he repeatedly made extremely perilous trips under heavy rifle and mortar fire and single-handledly loaded and evacuted approximately 45 casualties, working tirelessly and with utter disregard for his own safety during a gruelling period of more than 3 hours. Despite intense, persistent enemy fire, he ran out to aid two men whom he believed to be wounded Marines but was himself mortally wounded by a Japanese sniper while carrying out his hazardous mission."

Allison, Kevin, Henry, and Beverly are a mile beneath GD in a bunker, and Henry forces Allison to open up a room that contains a teleportation device, and they will use this escape method to separate Kevin from the Artifact. Meanwhile Carter, Taggert, and Stark get in protective gear and go into quarantined Section 4, which is filled with rubble when the beams were degrading in All That Glitters.... They find many people in the morgue, where the infection supposedly began, but they are just fine. Taggert attempts to lead people out of Section 4 but the defense systems pretend to be Fargo. Henry and Beverly decide it is time to teleport Kevin to the other bunker, where the Consortium can get him.

Colpito ti ha in fronte, tu giaci ai miei piedi: sei parte di me che muor: sei parte di me che muor. Mi tendi ancor la mano, mentre debbo caricar.
