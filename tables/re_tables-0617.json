He suddenly sees Gohan floating down a river, but he can't reach him in time before he goes over a waterfall. Goku looks up and sees Gohan clinging to a branch, having somehow jumped out of the river. With Gohan safe, they head to Master Roshi's house.

        "Piccolo leaves Gohan alone in the wilderness for six months so he can learn to take care of himself, just like his father did as a child. Even though there are dangerous animals in the wild, Gohan's hidden powers help him escape, but also get him stuck on a really tall boulder, from which he can't get down. High above, Kami tells Mr. Popo that in a years time, both he and Piccolo will die from unknown causes and that if Piccolo knew this it might have been what caused his slow change of heart towards Gohan. Meanwhile, Krillin tries to break the news about Goku and Gohan to Chi Chi, but is too scared."

Knowing he needs a massive power increase, Buu causes the part of his head that was cut off earlier to suddenly engulf Gohan, just like Piccolo and Gotenks.

It turns out that Vegito is somehow still in full control of his new, candy body, and that he is just as powerful as he was before, and can even still talk! (Albeit in a higher pitch). The candy Vegito is just as fast as Super Vegito, and due to its tiny size, is impossible for Buu to hit. Infuriated at being toyed with by a piece of candy, Buu changes it back into Vegito, who then continues to beat him up. Vegito literally starts tearing Buu apart. He gives Buu until the count of ten until he destroys him, and during this countdown, Buu notices a part of himself that Vegito tore off down on the ground. This part rises up behind Vegito, and before Vegito reaches ten, he is engulfed by the pink blob. Buu calls the blob back to him and absorbs it.",

In the first match, Pan faces Wild Tiger, and the four-year-old easily dispatches him. Next up is Goku against a ten-year-old boy named Uub. Uub is the reincarnation of the evil Kid Majin Buu. King Yemma apparently heard Goku's wish right before the evil Buu was destroyed, and he reincarnated him as a good person named Uub. Uub is apprehensive, so to bait him into fighting, Goku eventually resorts to taunting the young boy. After a particularly nasty insult and a kick to the face, Uub has snapped, and is now ready to fight.",

When Goku does power up slightly (in his normal state) Uub nearly falls out of the ring, but Goku saves him from hitting the ground. He realizes that Uub doesn't even know how to fly, so Goku decides to train him. Despite his friends and family pleading with Goku to stay, he flies away with Uub on his back. Goku decides to train Uub to defend the Earth when he's gone. He hopes one day, when Uub's training is complete, to have a real all-out match with him to test their power.
