Inspector Falcon-Price arrives on the scene as well as Sergeant Nick Schultz who returns to Mount Thomas as part of the Homicide Squad to investigate the bombing. The team goes into overdrive trying to find Grace and the station bomber while Tom, seriously injured and fed up with the lack of effort his team is putting into finding Grace, discharges himself from the hospital and helps in the search; he finds Grace's body lying in a creek on the Holstein property, the Holsteins being relatives of suspect, Cal Milic. But, Grace's body was found only 1km from the Baxter house and Tom is determined to get the Baxters for what they'd done, although there is no evidence that points to Barry Baxter or any of his sons. Mount Thomas also gets two new members: Sergeant Mark Jacobs, whom the Inspector promises Tom's job to, and new edition to the C.I. team, Det. Snr. Const.

Tom, against all advice, also attends and provokes Barry telling him the fact that Troy was not his son. When the DNA tests arrive at the station, they reveal that it truly was Troy Baxter that raped Grace Curtis. Kelly and Joss are in hot water when their attempt to apprehend a criminal demanding ciggarettes turns out wrong and the shop attendant is on the receiving end of Kelly's pepper spray. Another victim of bad speed is found in Mount Thomas and the team suspects that the Baxters are behind it. A 15 year old girl is found by Evan and Susie in the women's toilets giving birth to a baby. Susan is nearly killed when a 4WD ploughs through her bedroom wall. Tom decides it isn't safe for her in Mount Thomas and forces her to move out of the area. Tom becomes more bitter and aggressive towards everyone and denies help from anyone. Susie and Ben's relationship may be going places and Jonsey is having trouble dealing with it.",

Upon reaching his home, they discover a video of his capture by the DNAliens. They track him down to the abandoned military base Los Soledad, where Paradox built his time machine. They discover that the Highbreed have erected a cloaking field, built by Cooper over the area, concealing a huge, mysterious arch-like device. They find Cooper helping to assemble pieces for the DNAliens out of a metal call barsidium. They free Cooper, but are soon captured by the Highbreed in charge of the base. Locking the team up in a storage room, they use Kevin\u2019s powers to absorb some of the barsidium, and use him as a tuning fork to amplify Echo Echo\u2019s powers, having discovered that the DNAliens are weakened by the strong reverb given off by the barsidium. They free Cooper and have him destroy the cloaking generator, during which he has visions of the arch acting as a gateway for a fleet of ships and the Earth being destroyed. The team is successful, and escapes. However, despite destroying the generator, the Highbreed manage to repair it and continue their operations unhindered, using ID masks to fool the local police by pretending to be construction workers, saying that soon, Los Soledad will be where all the action is happening.",

(After the events at the Pier, ship had been staying with Julie.)

Assuming that the Knights have something to do with a medieval-themed track of houses, the team, joined by Julie, attempt to sneak into the main house to recuse Ship. However, by this time, Chadwick had affixed a mind control on Ship, making his biometric markings go from green to red, and leaving him totally under Chadwick\u2019s control. Having absorbed the alien spacecraft that Chadwick made, the Knights now have the ultimate weapon. The team soon gets caught, and are to be executed by Ship.

        "While fighting one of the Highbreed, Ben's parents catch him transforming into Swampfire. Seeing as he comes home with a black eye, they forbid him from using the Omnitrix ever again for fear of him getting hurt. With Gwen and Kevin on the trail of a Highbreed plot, Ben tries to sneak out of the house as Echo Echo. Once Ben's parents see that he disobeyed their orders, they do what they think is best for their son's protection and safety and ground him. His various attempts to aid his allies by phone and by computer only results in Ben being forced to tell his parents about Gwen helping him, resulting in her suffering the same fate as her cousin, and leaving Kevin alone to find out what the Highbreed are up to. Kevin manages to find out that the Highbreed are planning to use radioactive bat guano as a power source for a \u201csurprise\u201d (the hyperspace jumpgate in Los Soledad). Having been captured, Kevin's trouble with the DNAliens results in Ben making a final attempt to persuade his parents to his cause, saying that if he does not help Kevin, it would be against everything they ever taught him, and so escapes as Humongousaur nonetheless. After a short battle aboard a small freighter carrying a rare isotope which the DNAliens plan on using, Ben's parents come to the rescue, with one of Grandpa Max's old Plumber guns, admitting that they are proud of Ben. They win the fight, and destroy the ship. They cancelled the punishment, apologized for the mistake, and say they understand what he needs to do.",

Gwen and Kevin gather all the allies they've met (Alan, Cooper, Julie and Ship, as well as their enemy Darkstar) to counter the threat. Meanwhile, Azmuth reveals to Ben that the Omnitrix contains the DNA of every sentient species in the galaxy, over one million in total, and unlocks the Master Control so Ben can effectively combat the Highbreed. This includes all of his old aliens. With Ben as Cannonbolt, the team converge on the Highbreed hyperspace jump gate in Los Soledad in an effort to prevent its activation, but the attack only provokes the Highbreed in charge to summon the fleet ahead of schedule. To try and stop the fleet coming through, the team with Ben as Upchuck attempts to destroy the hyperspace jump gate but it does not work. Ben then turns into Way Big, and tries to rip down the gateway, it starts to work but as the Highbreed in charge now preemptively activates the gate, it initiates and knocks Ben unconscious. The team has to get to the captain of the fleet, on the Highbreed head ship to stop the invasion. Ben, Gwen and Kevin quickly head to the captain of the fleet. The Highbreed commander and the team fight, and Gwen releases her dormant Anodite form for the first time, but returns to her normal form. The trio is then surrounded by a group of DNAliens, but are saved by Grandpa Max, Pierce, Helen and Manny plus one Null Guardian, who have regained control over the Null Void. Ben, Gwen, Kevin, Azmuth and Ship as a spaceship head to the Highbreed's homeworld to confront the Highbreed Supreme with Ben as Brainstorm being the pilot. The Highbreed Supreme refuses to recall the fleet, and Azmuth reveals that the Highbreed's obsession with genetic purity has resulted in sterility in their species: they intend to cleanse the galaxy of all life in retaliation. Using the Omnitrix, Ben sends out an energy wave that reprograms the DNA of every Highbreed in the galaxy, fusing their DNA with random species from the Omnitrix to repair their genetic damage. Stunned and horrified at the loss of the genetic unity, the Highbreed Supreme immediately consider racial suicide as their only honorable option, but Reinrassic III, who has returned, convinces his race that their new impurity is desirable, and the fleet is recalled. Max decides to take in Ben's recruits (all except Darkstar, who ran off) and train them. As a side effect of reprogramming the Highbreed genetic damage, Ben finds the Master Control has been reset, leaving him with brand new aliens as well as his old ones.",

Using the Omnitrix, Ben sends out an energy wave that reprograms the DNA of every Highbreed in the galaxy, fusing their DNA with random species from the Omnitrix to repair their genetic damage. Stunned and horrified at the loss of the genetic unity, the Highbreed Supreme immediately consider racial suicide as their only honorable option, but Reinrassic III, who has returned, convinces his race that their new impurity is desirable, and the fleet is recalled.

As a side effect of reprogramming the Highbreed genetic damage, Ben finds the Master Control has been reset, leaving him with brand new aliens as well as his old ones.",
        "Paradox and Azmuth arrive on Earth to warn Ben of the approaching Highbreed fleet. Gwen and Kevin gather all the allies they've met (Alan, Cooper, Julie and Ship, as well as their enemy Darkstar) to counter the threat. Meanwhile, Azmuth reveals to Ben that the Omnitrix contains the DNA of every sentient species in the galaxy, over one million in total, and unlocks the Master Control so Ben can effectively combat the Highbreed. This includes all of his old aliens. With Ben as Cannonbolt, the team converge on the Highbreed hyperspace jump gate in Los Soledad in an effort to prevent its activation, but the attack only provokes the Highbreed in charge to summon the fleet ahead of schedule. To try and stop the fleet coming through, the team with Ben as Upchuck attempts to destroy the hyperspace jump gate but it does not work. Ben then turns into Way Big, and tries to rip down the gateway, it starts to work but as the Highbreed in charge now preemptively activates the gate, it initiates and knocks Ben unconscious. The team has to get to the captain of the fleet, on the Highbreed head ship to stop the invasion. Ben, Gwen and Kevin quickly head to the captain of the fleet. The Highbreed commander and the team fight, and Gwen releases her dormant Anodite form for the first time, but returns to her normal form. The trio is then surrounded by a group of DNAliens, but are saved by Grandpa Max, Pierce, Helen and Manny plus one Null Guardian, who have regained control over the Null Void.

After winning a soccer game and meeting a girl named Julie, he visits Grandpa Max only to discover that he\u2019s disappeared. Inisde Max\u2019s RV, the Rustbucket, Ben finds a Holo-viewer with a recording from Max telling Ben that he has the Omnitrix and he\u2019s safe. However, Ben has had the Omnitrix ever since he took it off years ago. He asks Gwen for advice, wondering if Grandpa wants him to wear the Omnitrix again. Soon, they meet Magister Labrid, an agent of the Plumbers. Stating that he\u2019s Max\u2019s partner in a case he was working on, Ben and Gwen decide to team up with him. Ben decides to put the Omnitrix back on. The first place they go is to a train station where an arms trade between the Forever Knights and the DNAliens, brokered by Kevin Levin. They attempt to arrest the Knights and the aliens, and a battle follows. When Ben tries to dial in his alien on his Omnitrix, the device reboots and recalibrates into a thin watch with a color scheme of green and black, making it more stylish and giving him access to 10 new aliens which are more powerful than his aliens he had before. The DNAliens get away, the Forever Knights escape with one of the weapons crates, and Kevin is captured. The Plumber asks Kevin for help in finding the Knights\u2019 hideout. Kevin, having not been paid, leads the group to a large castle. Inside, they find all sorts of medieval artifacts, as well as a robotic dragon. Fleeing from the dragon, the group runs into an army of Forever Knights. In the ensuing confrontation, Magister Labrid is killed when he saves Kevin's life, and Kevin joins Ben and Gwen on their search for Max to repay that debt. Using a leftover Laser Lance, Gwen is able to trace it back to its original owners. The soon find a secret underground base, they discover an army of DNAliens.

Annoyed at being discovered, the Highbreed commander defeats the team, and orders the termination of all life within a five-mile radius to eliminate any witnesses. Using Humongousaur, Ben is successful in his efforts to stop the commander, he learns that any damage he receives while transformed is inflicted upon his human form as well. Deciding to finish Max\u2019s last mission, Ben, Gwen, and Kevin become a team. But, according to another Highbreed deep inside another base, they have no idea what they\u2019re up against.",

        "While Gwen, Ben, and Kevin are taking a break at Grandpa Max\u2019s favorite fishing spot, they see a mysterious cloaked woman leave a flower made of pure mana energy at the base of Max\u2019s favorite tree. When the team tries to meet her, she disappears. They decide to stake out the area for a while until the woman shows up again. The wait for 3 nights, and their patience is rewarded. The woman shows up, and is able to beat both Ben and Kevin in battle. However, when she sees Gwen use her powers, she\u2019s amazed. As it turns out, Gwen\u2019s \u201cmagic\u201d powers are in fact inherited from the strange woman, who turns out to be Ben and Gwen\u2019s grandmother, Verdona, who is an energy being known as an Anodite. After getting the full story from Gwen\u2019s parents, Verdona offers to take Gwen back to her home planet, Anodyne, where she can learn how to reach the full and maximum potential of her powers (which would require seventy-five years). Gwen tells Verdona that she cannot leave her friends, not while the Earth is in such danger. Verdona then transforms into her true Anodite form, and decides to destroy Gwen's human body, thus releasing the Anodite inside. After a short battle, Gwen firmly tells Verdona that she wants to stay on Earth and stay the way she is, saying that it\u2019s what Max would have wanted.

        "While Gwen, Ben, and Kevin are taking a break at Grandpa Max\u2019s favorite fishing spot, they see a mysterious cloaked woman leave a flower made of pure mana energy at the base of Max\u2019s favorite tree. When the team tries to meet her, she disappears. They decide to stake out the area for a while until the woman shows up again. The wait for 3 nights, and their patience is rewarded. The woman shows up, and is able to beat both Ben and Kevin in battle. However, when she sees Gwen use her powers, she\u2019s amazed. As it turns out, Gwen\u2019s \u201cmagic\u201d powers are in fact inherited from the strange woman, who turns out to be Ben and Gwen\u2019s grandmother, Verdona, who is an energy being known as an Anodite. After getting the full story from Gwen\u2019s parents, Verdona offers to take Gwen back to her home planet, Anodyne, where she can learn how to reach the full and maximum potential of her powers (which would require seventy-five years).

Kevin grabs the severed hand of the robot (possibly planning to put its defense mechanisms in his car). Later, the team goes to Mr. Smoothie\u2019s for a break. Two bullies named Cash and JT, who used to pick on Ben when he was 10, decide to embarrass Ben by spilling smoothie on him. Ben, however, stands up to them, and makes a point to the other people at the smoothy shop pointing out how pathetic JT and Cash really are. Later that night, they see Kevin\u2019s car outside a restaurant, and decide to wreck it for retribution. They push it down a hill, smashing the trunk open. The grab the Techadon gauntlet before the car\u2019s alarm attracts Kevin. Back at their hang out, and abandoned mannequin factory, Cash puts the gauntlet on, planning on using its built-in laser blaster to destroy Ben once and for all and repair their reputation. Over time, the full robot armor begins to reform around Cash\u2019s bod. Worried about his friend, JT goes to Ben\u2019s team for help. Kevin wants to go it alone as revenge for his car, but is soon defeated by the now immensely powered Cash. Seeking Ben out, a battle at Mr. Smoothie\u2019s rages between Ben as Chromastone and the almost fully restored Techadon. In the end, Cash is able to force the robot back into the gauntlet and restore control over his own body. Ben is able to overpower Cash as Chromastone, and JT manages to convince Cash to fight the Techadon's influence, reverting it back into the gauntlet. JT thanks Ben, and takes Cash back home, with Gwen and Ben forgetting about a beat up Kevin still being in the mannequin factory.",

The creature seems to be aging everything it touches at an accelerated rate. While Ben, Gwen, and Kevin investigate, see a strange man who seems to be able to disappear at will. After trying to fight him, the team soon formally meet the man known as Paradox, a scientist from the 1950s who was sucked into the event horizon of his time-travel experiment. Displaced from time and space, Paradox has existed for 100,000 years and is able to move through time at will. However, the same mistake that rendered him ageless created the creature they seek. The team is chased by the creature. It ages Kevin\u2019s car to dust, and even turns Kevin himself into an elderly man. After Paradox reverses Kevin\u2019s age, Ben realizes that the creature is not acting like a monster, but a confused person, going to phone booths and libraries, as though it was looking for information. Ben has Paradox take them back to the day of the time travel accident. The creature turns out to be Paradox\u2019s assistant, Hugo, who was also sucked into the event horizon. But instead of going through the same thing as Paradox, Hugo was turned into the aging creature and sent to the modern time. There, as Humungousaur, Ben rescues Hugo, nullifying the creature's existence. In the present, the now old Hugo joins Paradox in exploring time and space.",

Slaying the dragon is the very reason their organization exists. After teaming up with the Knight\u2019s mightiest warrior, Sir Connor, in a failed attempt to destroy the dragon, Ben notices that the dragon appears to be trying to communicate. Using Humungousaur to scare information out of one of the Knights, the team leaves the Knights behind and tracks the dragon to a warehouse where its spaceship is being held.

        "In the middle of a fight with another Techadon Robot, Ben, Gwen, and Kevin are unexpectedly transported by the Omnitrix to an alien planet called Primus. They soon discover that the planet is actually created by Azmuth, for it contains all the DNA samples from every life form in the galaxy. They soon learn that Vilgax is there to stop the Omnitrix at its source and that the Omnitrix's fail-safe program brought them there to defend the planet. Azmuth attempts to stop Vilgax, but loses and Ben is captured along with Kevin and Gwen. Ben offers to teach Vilgax about the Omnitrix if he lets Gwen and Kevin go. He turns Vilgax into Goop, shuts off Goop's artificial gravity projector and removes the Omnitrix from his immobile body. Ben then uses Way Big to throw a giant Vilgax (caused by immersion in the Codon stream) off the planet and, though it doesn't make up for damaging the Omnitrix, Azmuth thanking Ben by letting him keep it.",

        "A deadly criminal known as \"Ragnarok\" breaks out of the Null Void, and begins a search for a mysterious key. Meanwhile, Kevin returns home to find his house ransacked with his mom, who confesses the truth about Ragnarok. Kevin then asks Ben and Gwen if they know anything about Ragnarok, and when they tell him they don't. He tells them to stay out of the situation. The two, now concerned, ask Grandpa Max if he knows anything about the escape. He confesses to having a partner named Devin, who risked his life to stop Ragnarok several years ago. His partner's full name was none other than Devin Levin, Kevin's father. Ben and Gwen track Kevin with his Plumber's badge and together, they force Ragnarok to flee. Gwen then helps Kevin find the \"key\" which is revealed to be disguised as a picture frame of a younger Kevin and his father, but Ragnarok steals it, then teleports to his ship called \"the Harvester\".. Ben, Gwen, and Kevin manage to transport themselves via the same signal, but before they find Ragnarok, Kevin tricks the other two to get into an escape pod. With Ben and Gwen descending down to Earth, Kevin can now exact his vengeance without interference. He and Ragnarok battle, while Kevin causes the entire ship to destabilize into a vortex. Ragnarok begs Kevin to save him, stating that his father would too. Despite his desperation, Kevin merely takes his key and deliberately allows him to get sucked into the vortex. Ragnarok's ship explodes. Ben and Gwen see the explosion from the ground and think Kevin is dead but Ben turns around when he hears Kevin and they notice that he survived the explosion. Kevin then walks home after mentioning that Ragnarok is dead, but he will be returned.",

He tries revert to his old form but he is not able to, for he needs the Omnitrix. Soon Vilgax proposes that the two of them should take revenge on Ben. Myaxx warns Azmuth of the Ultrimatrix's disappearance. Meanwhile, Ben is captured by an old enemy, Kraab. Gwen and Kevin, along with Ship, take flight to rescue Ben, while in the process destroys Kraab's ship, and rescuing Kraab as well. Later, Albedo defeats and captures Kevin (as Diamondhead) and Gwen (as Swampfire) and fails to defeat Max as Spidermonkey so runs away as Rath. Max goes to Ben's house and Albedo appears on his TV, blackmailing Ben to come to his friends' rescue. Albedo, as Humugousaur, turns into Ultimate Humungousaur, with the power of the Ultimatrix, and fights Ben as Humungosaur. Ben discovers that Albedo has been working in conjunction with Vilgax. In order to save his friends, Ben gives up the Omnitrix to Vilgax. Max arrives and frees Ben and the gang and gives Gwen her old spell book which she uses to cast a teleportation spell that allows the gang to escape. Vilgax betrays Albedo, keeping the Omnitrix (against their deal) and uses it to turn his army of bioids into Humongousaurs. Albedo fights and defeats most of them as Ultimate Humongousaur but they eventually defeat him. Ashamed from what he recently did, Ben runs away into the forest where Gwen comes to help him but she is unable to as Ben is too depressed. Ben cries out Azmuth's name for help. Behind him, Azmuth reveals to Ben the secrets to the Ultimatrix and how to defeat Vilgax and Albedo. Powerless, Ben along with Gwen, Kevin, and Max, go aboard Vilgax's ship and faces off with Vilgax to stop his invasion of Earth. Ben sets the Omnitrix on self-destruct when Vilgax refuses to surrender it and eventually the Omnitrix self-destructs, which causes Kevin to return to his normal self. Ben then sets Albedo's Ultramatrix to self-destruct as well, but Albedo gives the Ultimatrix to Ben and shuts off the self-destruct. With the Omnitrix destroyed, Ben goes off and fights Vilgax with Swampfire from the Ultimatrix, but since Swampfire is too weak, he soon becomes Ultimate Swampfire and fights Vilgax while Gwen and Max take control of Vilgax's ship which is about to crash onto Earth. As the ship sinks underwater, Ben escapes Vilgax's true alien form, a giant octopus-like creature, and comes to surface as Jetray where Gwen, Kevin and Max are floating after the ship's fusion drive explodes, apparently with Ben still inside it. Ben appears shortly afterwards and the whole gang hugs. Kevin wondered if Vilgax is alive and if he will return, but Ben says, \"If he ever does, it's hero time!\"",

With the Omnitrix destroyed, Ben goes off and fights Vilgax with Swampfire from the Ultimatrix, but since Swampfire is too weak, he soon becomes Ultimate Swampfire and fights Vilgax while Gwen and Max take control of Vilgax's ship which is about to crash onto Earth. As the ship sinks underwater, Ben escapes Vilgax's true alien form, a giant octopus-like creature, and comes to surface as Jetray where Gwen, Kevin and Max are floating after the ship's fusion drive explodes, apparently with Ben still inside it. Ben appears shortly afterwards and the whole gang hugs. Kevin wondered if Vilgax is alive and if he will return, but Ben says, \"If he ever does, it's hero time!\"",
        "Albedo steals the incomplete Ultimatrix (a new device which Azmuth is working on) from Azmuth's lab and completes it. He tries revert to his old form but he is not able to, for he needs the Omnitrix. Soon Vilgax proposes that the two of them should take revenge on Ben. Myaxx warns Azmuth of the Ultrimatrix's disappearance. Meanwhile, Ben is captured by an old enemy, Kraab. Gwen and Kevin, along with Ship, take flight to rescue Ben, while in the process destroys Kraab's ship, and rescuing Kraab as well. Later, Albedo defeats and captures Kevin (as Diamondhead) and Gwen (as Swampfire) and fails to defeat Max as Spidermonkey so runs away as Rath. Max goes to Ben's house and Albedo appears on his TV, blackmailing Ben to come to his friends' rescue. Albedo, as Humugousaur, turns into Ultimate Humungousaur, with the power of the Ultimatrix, and fights Ben as Humungosaur. Ben discovers that Albedo has been working in conjunction with Vilgax. In order to save his friends, Ben gives up the Omnitrix to Vilgax. Max arrives and frees Ben and the gang and gives Gwen her old spell book which she uses to cast a teleportation spell that allows the gang to escape. Vilgax betrays Albedo, keeping the Omnitrix (against their deal) and uses it to turn his army of bioids into Humongousaurs. Albedo fights and defeats most of them as Ultimate Humongousaur but they eventually defeat him. Ashamed from what he recently did, Ben runs away into the forest where Gwen comes to help him but she is unable to as Ben is too depressed. Ben cries out Azmuth's name for help. Behind him, Azmuth reveals to Ben the secrets to the Ultimatrix and how to defeat Vilgax and Albedo. Powerless, Ben along with Gwen, Kevin, and Max, go aboard Vilgax's ship and faces off with Vilgax to stop his invasion of Earth. Ben sets the Omnitrix on self-destruct when Vilgax refuses to surrender it and eventually the Omnitrix self-destructs, which causes Kevin to return to his normal self. Ben then sets Albedo's Ultramatrix to self-destruct as well, but Albedo gives the Ultimatrix to Ben and shuts off the self-destruct. With the Omnitrix destroyed, Ben goes off and fights Vilgax with Swampfire from the Ultimatrix, but since Swampfire is too weak, he soon becomes Ultimate Swampfire and fights Vilgax while Gwen and Max take control of Vilgax's ship which is about to crash onto Earth.
