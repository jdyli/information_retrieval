Joe first appears in The Best Night Ever, as the owner of a donut shop in Canterlot. Twilight Sparkle and Spike state that they were frequent customers of Joe while they resided in Canterlot. He next appears aboard a train to Canterlot in MMMystery on the Friendship Express, gloating about how his Donutopia will win first place at the National Dessert Competition instead of the Cakes' Marzipan Mascarpone Meringue Madness. Joe is later under suspicion when Pinkie Pie theorizes that he is the culprit behind the damaging of the Cakes' cake, until Twilight proves that Joe did not do it after the other bakers' entries are eaten. When accused by Pinkie Pie, Joe is shown as a spy agent reminiscent of the James Bond series. Joe later admits to eating Gustave's \u00e9clairs, and Mulia admits to eating his Donutopia. At Pinkie's suggestion, the remainder of Joe's Donutopia was combined with the leftover treats to form a new cake for the competition. Joe appears to be a friendly and prideful baker, believing without a doubt his Donutopia will win first prize. When he is accused of eating Gustave's \u00e9clairs, he admits it was not out of spite, but rather because of how Pinkie Pie described it, and sincerely compliments Gustave.",

She also can feel sad and lonely after she misses her hometown and wanting to come back As one of the Rainbow Princesses alongside Brights Brightly, Cheerilee and Whistle Wishes, she was in charge on bringing in the first rainbow of the season and also using the Magic Wand. The Magic Wand allows her to control the colors to bring in the first rainbow of the season and lets her summon the Crystal Carriage. When it's not in use, she stores it inside her mane. In Friendship is Magic, Rarity became an older unicorn in the series. She is very stylish and beautiful, takes great interest in fashion and clothing design. She loves praise and acclaim and often tries to make herself the center of attention. However, she is glad to drop everything and make new outfits for her friends, even when they prove very hard to please. She is both a business owner and fashion designer, running the Carousel Boutique in Ponyville. She considers herself a lady and often acts sophisticated. She can also be very dramatic, often when a disaster occurs to her. She is Sweetie Belle's older sister and dreams of becoming a designer for Princess Celestia. She fantasized about marrying Celestia's nephew Prince Blueblood, until he she actually met him, where he turned out to be snobbish, rude, and self-centred.

He is the older brother of Twilight Sparkle and the husband of Princess Cadance, which shocks his little sister upon hearing the news. Although very close to his sister, he has evidently lost touch with her as a result of her relocation to Ponyville. Initially, he is happy to see Twilight again upon her return to Canterlot, asking her to be his Best Mare at the wedding. However, due to a spell put on him this excitement quickly turns to frustration and anger as she - unbeknownst to the rest of the cast, correctly - decries the Changeling Queen Chrysalis, in the form of Cadance, as evil and unworthy of her brother.

She also can demonstrate magic, however, this was only shown in \"Once Upon a My Little Pony Time\", where she used it to fix Rainbow Dash's scarf. In Friendship is Magic, she is a young unicorn pony and also Rarity's younger sister. She is also one of Apple Bloom's friends, and a member of the \"Cutie Mark Crusaders\". Sweetie Belle tends to be a slower thinker than Apple Bloom and Scootaloo, but is as excitable as they are and will readily follow their lead. Though she wants to be a designer like Rarity, her inexperience and clumsiness prove to be a hindrance when she tries to assist in the shop. She has a talent for singing and songwriting, turning one of Fluttershy's lullabies into a rousing gospel number, but prefers not to sing in public.",

        "Twinkleshine is fairly commonly featured in the series as a background pony, appearing in over half the episodes in season 1. Her first and most prominent appearance is in Friendship is Magic, part 1, where she, Lemon Hearts and Minuette meet Twilight Sparkle in Canterlot while carrying presents on their backs. She informs Twilight about Moondancer's get-together and asks her to come along. When Twilight declines on the grounds that she has \"a lot of studying to catch up on\", Twinkleshine expresses her exasperation behind Twilight's back and chides her for showing more interest in books than friends. She next appears in the surprise party that Pinkie Pie throws for Twilight later in the episode, and has since then remained a regular sight in Ponyville. In The Ticket Master, she is one of the ponies crowding around Twilight in front of the library, and again in the alley that Twilight eventually teleports away from. A handful of frames show her starting to run after Twilight, but she is not part of the throng of background ponies in the chase scene that follows. During her two-second participation in the race, her mane style changes to one resembling that of Cherry Berry and Berry Punch. In The Cutie Mark Chronicles, she appears in Fluttershy and Rainbow Dash's flashbacks of flight camp, standing on a cloud in the sidelines before the race starts, even though she is not a pegasus. However, as proved in Sonic Rainboom, there is a spell that enables non-pegasus ponies to walk on clouds, making the circumstances around Twinkleshine's station in Cutie Mark Chronicles much more plausible. In A Canterlot Wedding Part 1 and Part 2, she is one of Queen Chrysalis's first bridesmaids, along with Minuette and Lyra Heartstrings. Her design in the animation resembles the G1 pony Moondancer. However her playful pony release gave her a different look, making her resemble the G2 pony Princess Twinkle Star. Twinkleshine's description in the toys says she wants to be a Movie Star.",

        "Fluttershy is a shy Pegasus Pony with a high-pitched, squeaky voice who was originally an Earth Pony. She was first released in 2003 as part of the Rainbow Celebration Ponies. In the G3 series, she loves to take pictures of her friends and have fun and is fond of window shopping at all the sweet boutiques in Ponyville. In Friendship is Magic, she receives a design change, making her into a Pegasus Pony. She is sweet and good-natured, but is timid and shy around others, though she is big-hearted enough to stand up for other ponies when they are in trouble. Fluttershy has a great love and care for animals and is willing to help them at any cost. Although she is a pegasus, she prefers the ground to the sky. She fell from the sky when Rainbow Dash challenged her bullies to a race, and she came to know of the animals living on the ground, thus marking her beginning as the animal caretaker. She lives in a cottage near the Everfree forest instead of in the clouds with the other pegasi, due to her fear of heights. She has an ability known as \"The Stare,\" which assists her in disciplining misbehaving animals. In 'Suited for Success', Fluttershy was shown to be knowledgeable on certain stitching techniques when Rarity makes her gala dress. According to the Cutie Mark Chronicles, she was saved by a group of butterflies after falling from Cloudsdale. Rainbow Dash's Sonic Rainboom scared the animals Fluttershy befriended and after consoling them, she earned her cutie mark. Fluttershy's spirit is Kindness.",

Celestia's Pegasus guards first appeared in the first episode, as a pair of the more commonly seen white-coat Pegasus guards chauffeur Twilight Sparkle and Spike from Canterlot to Ponyville in a flying chariot. Their following appearance is in the second episode, when the Mayor commands them to stop Night Mare Moon, she strikes them with lightning bolts to swat them away. The guards later draw the royal chariot into town at the end of the episode. They briefly appear in Swarm of the Century, driving Celestia's flying chariot, and in Sonic Rainboom, accompanying Celestia in her spectator box at Cloudsdale's stadium. They make their only speaking appearance in A Bird in the Hoof, where they guard the Princess and search for her pet bird, Philomeena. Two guards stand on duty at the entrance to Sugarcube Corner where Celestia is staying. They are pestered by Rainbow Dash who tries to elicit a response from them, but they remain stoic and silent. Soon afterwards, they hinder Fluttershy's entrance until Twilight confirms she's allowed inside. Later, a guard notifies Celestia that the mayor seeks an audience with her. Even later, two guards are sent to inform Twilight that the Princess's bird is missing, and they continue looking for the bird throughout the episode. The episode ends with the bird tickling the guards and making them laugh at Rainbow Dash's request. Luna's Pegasus guards first appeared in the season 2 episode \"Luna Eclipsed\", chauffeuring her flying carriage to Ponyville. They have a dark gray coat, black tails, tufts of hair on the tips of their ears, bat-like wings, and cat-like slit pupils. Their armor is purple, and it has a webbed crest over the helm. They resemble Celestia's guards, except have a much darker look about them.",

        "The Royal Pegasus Guards are a group of loyal Pegasus Ponies that serve both Princess Celestia and Princess Luna. Celestia's Pegasus guards first appeared in the first episode, as a pair of the more commonly seen white-coat Pegasus guards chauffeur Twilight Sparkle and Spike from Canterlot to Ponyville in a flying chariot. Their following appearance is in the second episode, when the Mayor commands them to stop Night Mare Moon, she strikes them with lightning bolts to swat them away. The guards later draw the royal chariot into town at the end of the episode. They briefly appear in Swarm of the Century, driving Celestia's flying chariot, and in Sonic Rainboom, accompanying Celestia in her spectator box at Cloudsdale's stadium. They make their only speaking appearance in A Bird in the Hoof, where they guard the Princess and search for her pet bird, Philomeena. Two guards stand on duty at the entrance to Sugarcube Corner where Celestia is staying. They are pestered by Rainbow Dash who tries to elicit a response from them, but they remain stoic and silent. Soon afterwards, they hinder Fluttershy's entrance until Twilight confirms she's allowed inside. Later, a guard notifies Celestia that the mayor seeks an audience with her. Even later, two guards are sent to inform Twilight that the Princess's bird is missing, and they continue looking for the bird throughout the episode. The episode ends with the bird tickling the guards and making them laugh at Rainbow Dash's request.

        "The group retires for the evening from the previous dinner. In the early morning, Adrianna is frightened by something in the breakfast nook, races out of the manor into a waiting golf cart, and attempts to leave the manor. As she tries to drive off, the golf cart explodes, sending Adrianna flying into a nearby tree to her death; the commotion wakes the other guests. Investigation: The investigation covers three areas, with the following clues identified by various guests: The crime scene (near the gates): Among the wreckage, the investigators find that the golf cart seat had been sliced open underneath, as if to plant something inside. A large tree branch had purposely been placed on the paved path, which apparently forced the cart onto the nearby grass. The investigators also discover a nearby post with a broken video camera mounted on it. The last known whereabouts (the breakfast nook): The TV in the breakfast nook is still on. As the guests investigate, they see the television signal interrupted with surveillance footage of Adrianna; this is followed by the message, \"Drive off the property if you want to live.\" Several doors are marked with footprints, and almost every set of doors have been locked from the opposite side with cable ties securing them in place. Only one door leading outside is otherwise open. The morgue (at the body's location, up in a tree): Adrianna's hand is holding onto a remote control, and while most of her body is burned, the most burn marks appear to be by her feet and legs. Riddle challenge: The guests are given a golf ball with the words \"13 steps\" printed on it. This points to a golf cart parked outside down a stairway with 13 steps; the cart holds various remote gate openers with a clue leading to video tapes stored in an outside trash bin. Though the tapes have no useful video, the inside cover of each tape has a final clue that directs the guests to the attic. Ronnie alone is first to the attic, where he finds another monitor and a television remote with a \"bomb\" button on it. When he follows instructions on the monitor to press this button, the monitor shows Ronnie the footage of the golf cart exploding. Solution: The killer had planted a bomb in the golf cart and set the branch in the path. The killer then planted a DVD in the television in the breakfast nook. As Adrianna watched television, the killer remotely started the DVD, instructing her to drive off the premises in order to stay alive. Adrianna tries to leave the room, but the killer had used cable ties to secure all the doors except the one leading outside. She reached the golf cart and sped off, and as she approached the gates, she was forced to drive off the path to avoid the tree branch. Adrianna tried to use the remote control to open the gates, but instead this activated the camera near the scene. The killer, already holed up in the attic with video surveillance equipment, used this as a signal to remotely trigger the bomb on the cart, killing Adrianna and sending her body flying into a tree.

        "Princess Celestia, the elder sister of Princess Luna, is one of the two rulers of Equestria and has the magical ability to control the sun. One thousand years before the start of the series, she used the Elements of Harmony to seal her sister, who had transformed herself into Nightmare Moon, into the moon. She is Twilight Sparkle's teacher and gave her the task to \"make friends\" in Ponyville upon learning of Nightmare Moon's return. However, after her sister is restored to her true form, she forgives her and allows Twilight Sparkle to remain in Ponyville with a new task of \"studying the magic of friendship\". She almost always refers to Twilight Sparkle as \"her Faithful Student\". She often does not directly state her goals, but rather gives advice to help her students find the answers they need. Though viewed with great reverence and awe due to her position, she often encourages her subjects to relax with jokes and gentle questions. She also shows great patience with any inappropriate behavior towards her. While always regal in both appearance and manner, Princess Celestia has been known to display a fun-loving side, appreciating the humor in a bottle of disappearing ink sent to her by Twilight. At times, she will even disregard the strict standards of high-class society when they become too much of a burden for her. However, it has been shown that while kindhearted and slow to anger, Celestia's patience does have its limits. When Spike makes her aware that Twilight has inadvertently unleashed mass chaos onto Ponyville in her obsessive attempts to find an overdue Friendship report to send to the Princess, Celestia personally intervenes to undo the damage caused by Twilight and sternly orders her student to a private meeting to discuss her actions; one of the few instances thus far where she was genuinely angry, albeit justifiably given the chaos Twilight caused. Fortunately, even in anger Celestia remains understanding, and at the insistence of Twilight's friends agrees not to punish Twilight, instead asking them all to send her friendship reports only when the lessons make themselves apparent to them. Princess Celestia possesses magic far beyond normal unicorn ponies. She is able to control the sun and the daytime sky, bringing them out each day and then moving them away to make room for the night. She also has the ability to dispel magic. Princess Celestia was originally supposed to be Queen Celestia, as is logical considering her position, but Hasbro requested the name be changed, alleging that Disney has caused princesses to be associated with good and queens associated with evil. Princess Celestia is the highest authority, with no king or queen who outranks her.",

        "Princess Luna is the younger sister of Celestia. Originally she raised/lowered the moon each night, but she became jealous of Celestia because the ponies slept through the night and thus could not appreciate her work. This jealousy eventually transformed Luna into the shadowy Nightmare Moon. In her new form, her body is black in blue armor with her mane and tail appearing to be made entirely out of sparkly indigo, purple-rimmed moondust that she can use as limbs. Celestia was forced to seal her in the moon after she attempted to bring eternal night to the world. During the pilot episode, she breaks free after a thousand years and returns to Equestria on the longest day of the year, intent on carrying out her plan again. She uses her powers to hinder Twilight Sparkle and the other ponies in their search for the Elements of Harmony. In season 2, she undergoes a design change, with her mane changed from opaque to translucent, and she became slightly taller and more slender. Eventually, she is returned to her original form with the Elements and resumes her place at Celestia's side. Luna returns to Ponyville during Nightmare Night, Equestria's version of Halloween, with a taller and more slender build, a darker coat, and a translucent mane and tail. With Twilight's help, she tries to change her public image from that of the terrifying Nightmare Moon (on which the holiday is based) to a more favorable one as Princess. Her first attempts end disastrously, prompting her to decree Nightmare Night canceled, but Twilight persuades her to give Ponyville another chance. When Luna discovers that the residents enjoy being scared as part of the night's festivities, she uses the Nightmare Moon persona to help them have fun and thus gains their trust and friendship. Luna is shown to be extremely royal and formal towards her subjects, being quick to anger and easily offended. This off-putting facade of authority, however, is revealed to be a product of her thousand-year-old customs and ideas of propriety rather than intentional rudeness, and is shown to belie her fundamentally sensitive, caring, fun-loving nature. The results of Luna's thousand-year imprisonment in the moon and her subsequent unfamiliarity with more modern customs show themselves quite strongly in the fourth episode of season 2. She is able to control the moon and the night sky, bringing them out each night and then moving them away to make room for the dawn. As seen in Luna Eclipsed, she can bring inanimate objects back to life using her magic and can also shape-shift at will, noticeably assuming the form of Night Mare Moon. As Night Mare Moon, she is able to take on the form of objects and other characters. Luna has also shown (in the third season episode \"Sleepless in Ponyville\") the ability to enter ponies' dreams, as she does to help and counsel Scootaloo during one of her nightmares.",
