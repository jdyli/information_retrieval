        "Nicole, Kyle and Josh are en route to a psychology conference, but they get into an accident when Kyle (who was driving) becomes distracted and suddenly swerves to avoid hitting another car, which sends the Tragers' vehicle off the road before crashing into a ravine. The trio are consequently stranded in the woods with no means of communication, while Nicole is trapped inside. To make matters worse, the other driver is a pregnant woman named Gretchen, who then goes into labor. Kyle comes back every five minutes to seek Nicole's advice on how to deliver Gretchen's baby (a boy), which he delivers with Josh's help. Kyle communicates telepathically with Jessi, enabling assistance to be sent. However, Nicole is hospitalized with extensive internal bleeding. Kyle impersonates a doctor and uses his powers to try and make Nicole better, but it doesn't work and so he grudgingly turns to Cassidy, who tells him that Latnok will provide a remedy for Nicole only if Kyle joins them, and Kyle agrees. Meanwhile, Lori and Jessi are having trouble with each other and Josh's multiple phone calls to Andy go unanswered, but she shows up at the hospital after he leaves her a pained voicemail. Kyle returns from Nicole's room, announcing that she will be fine. Lori apologizes to Jessi for her rudeness.",

It is forested and has no resident population, but has many weekend-houses owned by the residents of Belgrade. During summer over 2,000 Belgraders spend weekends on Ada Me\u0111ica, which is accessible only by small boats. Leisure activities include swimming, walking and barbecues, as the area is nearly intact and without touristic facilities. One of the local communities which constitute the neighborhood of Blokovi of Novi Beograd was named Ada Me\u0111ica in the 1990s, with a population of 4,636 in 2002. The name of the island, Ada Me\u0111ica, is Serbian for border river island as for the centuries the Sava river was a border of many states (Roman Empire, Byzantine Empire, Kingdom of Hungary, Serbia, Ottoman Empire, Habsburg Monarchy, etc.). The island is on the borderline today too as it belongs to the municipality of Novi Beograd, and 100 meters away Ada Ciganlija belongs to the municipality of \u010cukarica.",
