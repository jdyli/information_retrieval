Before deciding what to do with the Hokages, Sasuke requests them their knowledge about Konoha and the Uchiha's origins. The First Hokage, Hashirama Senju, tells Sasuke how although during his childhood the Senju and Uchiha clans were at war, he met Madara in secret. Sharing the objective of a world without war, Hashirama and Madara became friends. However, both were found by their relatives and became enemies in the war as the head of their clans. After years of fighting, Madara accepted Hashirama's proposal to end the war and Konoha was created. Still, the hatred between the two clans resulted in Madara abandoning Konoha. Madara kept attacking the village until he was presumably killed by Hashirama. Having realized that both Hashirama and Itachi shared the same dreams, Sasuke decides to protect Konoha and goes with Orochimaru, Taka and the Hokages to the battlefield.",
