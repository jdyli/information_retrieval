With high levels of anxiety, Abby decides to wait until telling Mitch anything.

So Alex represents him in court and is powerful enough to release Kevin from a prison sentence.

Later in a conversation with Tammy, Abby reveals that it\u2019s better not telling Mitch about it because Abby says that Mitch finds these problems and won\u2019t let go of them, (and putting their family in danger), so Abby keeps quiet.
