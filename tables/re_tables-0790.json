        "Adama, Coker and Dr. Kelly abandon the Wild Weasel and trek through Djerba's harsh wind and snow, following a signal with Dr. Kelly's communicator. They track the signal to a huge cave, where they discover their escort unit dead from mysterious non-artillery wounds. Suddenly the cave floor collapses and plunges them into a dark underground chamber. Strange noises surround them and a large snake-like creature lunges out and bites Coker. As Coker struggles to contain the monster, a man rappels into the chamber and kills the snake. He introduces himself as Tech Sgt. Xander Toth, the only surviving escort. He explains that the snakes, which killed his unit, were created by Cylons doing half animal/half machine experiments. Toth has been alone in the cave for some time and is slightly mentally unstable, prone to unpredictable aggressive outbursts. Nevertheless, he has scouted a route to Dr. Kelly's objective. They leave the cave and stop at a cliff overlooking a seemingly abandoned resort compound.",

        "When Coker wants to send a rescue signal for the mortally wounded Toth, Adama and Dr. Kelly instead insist that they press on toward Dr. Kelly's objective. Coker demands to know Dr. Kelly's mission, and she finally explains that she will upload a virus to the Cylons' communications array. Once they find the array, Dr. Kelly begins her upload, but Coker shoots her and disarms Adama when he sees a Battlestar on the communications screen - Dr. Kelly is transmitting information about the ghost fleet to the Cylons. She shoots Coker several times and justifies her betrayal: she believes that the war will only end when humans negotiate with the Cylons, who she thinks value life more than humans do.

Things suddenly take a turn for the better when he receives news he has finally paid off his gran's debts and is free to sell the house.

        "As Ash and friends continue on their journey accompanied by Bianca, Bianca asks Iris for a practice match against Emolga, and they begin the battle of Emolga vs Pignite. However, Emolga's Attract immobilizes Pignite quickly. Bianca recalls Pignite and sends out her Minccino next and uses Attract. Emolga counters with Attract as well canceling the effects. Mincinno uses Tickle while Emolga is supposed to use Hidden Power, but Emolga uses Volt Switch and switches places with Iris's Excadrill that does not fight back. Iris sends Emolga out once more. Mincinno uses Hyper Voice but Emolga uses Volt Switch to switch places with Pansage who knocks out Mincinno with its Solarbeam. In one final attempt to battle with Emolga, she uses Volt Switch once more to switch with Ash's Snivy. In the end, Bianca has a battle with Ash making Snivy vs Pignite. Meanwhile, Iris tries to reason with Emolga, only for her to hit everyone nearby with Discharge. As everyone takes a break, Emolga tricks all the male Pok\u00e9mon to give her their apples, causing them to fight when the effects of the Attract wear off. Snivy, aware of it all, separates Emonga from the rest, sparking a rivalry between the two female Pok\u00e9mon. While everyone is sleeping, Emolga wanders off, and Oshawott and Axew follow her.

This angers Oshawott and it uses Razor Shell to get some apples but the Watchog aren't happy about that.

As Pikachu notifies the others of the other Pok\u00e9mon's disappearance, they come upon Simisear attacking and Snivy manages to block a blow, and Emolga finally fights Simisear. When Simisear gets even angrier, it uses Flamethrower on Emolga. Snivy uses a Vine Whip to trip Simisear and causes it to fall and blow off a boulder from a mountain. Snivy and Emolga destroy the rock and Simisear walks away with disgust. After the fight, Emolga begrudgingly offers Snivy an apple for helping her. With the crisis averted and Emolga learning to share, Bianca leaves the group, heading off to catch up with Ash's badge count.",

Blitzle uses Shock Wave, but Oshawott is able to block it with his Scalchop shell. Blitzle uses Flame Charge next and Oshawott counters with Aqua Jet. Oshawott prepares a Razor Shell attack until Blitzle does a Double Kick, knocking the Scalchop out of his hand. Oshawott runs off to try to find it, ending the battle prematurely. Ash and Pikachu catch up with Oshawott who searches in a field for the Scalchop, finding something that he believes to be his Scalchop until it shocks him, with Ash discovering that it is a Joltick. Next, Iris gives Oshawott an Iapapa Berry to stand in for the Scalchop. Pikachu uses Thundershock to test it, but Oshawott is hit by the shock. Cilan then gives Oshawott one of his serving domes, but it also does not protect Oshawott from the shock. Cilan then sends out Dwebble and has him craft a stone Scalchop for Oshawott. Even though it blocks Pikachu's Thundershock, it is much too heavy for Oshawott to carry. Ash helps Oshawott train to no luck, until later that night when Oshawott decides to train on his own with the large Scalchop, until Ash finds him and helps. When they meet Stephan again for the rematch, he has been powering up Blitzle with a bike generator. When the match begins, Oshawott is able to withstand the more powerful Shock Wave with the stone Scalchop until it shatters. However, training with the large shell has made Oshawott faster, and he is able to dodge Blitzle's attacks. Oshawott and Blitzle use Aqua Jet and Flame Charge against each other, with Oshawott winning the battle. After the match, Axew comes running up to the group, having found the real Scalchop. Oshawott puts it back on, happy that he and the shell are reunited, before going to sleep after the exhausting battle.",

        "In a practice match between Scraggy and Axew, the match is interrupted by a gust of wind followed by the appearance of a Cottonee. Cilan realizes that it is the time of year that Cottonee pair up and that this male Cottonee must be looking for a mate. While they watch it find a female Cottonee that he has fallen in love with, they watch as she attacks him because he is too weak. Scraggy steps forward, wanting to help Cottonee to become stronger and braver, but Scraggy's Scary Face sends it cowering behind a tree stump. Ash then steps in, helping train Cottonee against Scraggy, as Team Rocket watches the Cottonee swarm from afar. Axew and Cottonee train next, with Axew teaching Cottonee accuracy for its Energy Ball, and then Dwebble goes up against Cottonee to test its Razor Leaf and Solar Beam. Ash then sends out Tranquill to search for the other Cottonee so Cottonee can get a mate as Team Rocket calls in for new supplies. As soon as Ash and the others reach the Cottonee swarm, a gust of wind blows up from Team Rocket's large fan, catching all the Cottonee in a bag. Ash sends out Tranquill to slice open the bag with Air Cutter, freeing the Cottonee and dispatching Team Rocket. Later, the Cottonee they have been training with finally defeats several other male Cottonee, impressing the same female Cottonee from before and getting a mate. The next day, as the perfect weather conditions are finally met, Ash, Iris, Cilan, Pikachu, Axew, and Scraggy watch all the paired Cottonee drift away on the wind to a new life together.",

Ash and Iris believe it is a UFO, while Cilan insists there must be a scientific explanation. He claims to be a Science Connoisseur. When they reach town the next day, Cilan asks if there are any rumors of UFO sightings in the area, and someone overhearing the conversation directs them to Professor Ikarus. As they cross a rope bridge to his lab, they all receive a strange vision of Ash falling through one of the planks. When they test the plank before stepping on it, they watch it break. As they reach the professor's lab, Cilan knocks on the door and asks him if the UFO rumors are true. As professor Ikarus tries to get them to leave, Cilan convinces him to let them stay after praising his work. As Ikarus tries to explain what he is doing, they get a vision of something exploding. He rushes off to check on his experiment as Cilan and the others follow to see the professor's flying saucer. He tells them to remove its energy source, and they do so, with the help of professor Ikarus' Elgyem which is revealed to have psychic powers. The professor tells them of how he always wanted to travel to outerspace and spent most of his life developing a flying saucer spacecraft. He explained that when he tested one of his mini prototypes, it accidentally hit Elgyem, and he brought it back to his lab to help it heal, beginning their friendship. When Elgyem began showing interest in his research, Ikarus began having Elgyem test its powers, but it began to scare off the other townsfolk from his property to seclude them, which began the UFO rumors. Soon, two people approach the lab and state that they want to have Professor Ikarus be the first to see the successful manipulation of Dark Matter. However, a device they have soon traps Ash and the other and captures Elgyem, before the two people reveal themselves to be Team Rocket who escape with Elgyem. Cilan manages to send out Dwebble to free them from the device. Ikarus tells everyone to get onto his flying saucer and they chase Team Rocket in their hovercraft. As Ash's Tranquil fights Jessie's Woobat, Elgyem is freed by the efforts of Axew and Pansage, before Pikachu's Electro Ball destroys Team Rocket's hovercraft. However, the fight has damaged the professor's flying saucer. With only one engine working, the flying saucer falls into a gorge. Elgyem using Telekinesis manages to lift and land the saucer safely back at the lab. Ikarus then tells them that he plans to repair the flying saucer, and send Elgyem back into space. As Ash and the others say their goodbyes to the professor, Elgyem's psychic powers show the group various visions, which Cilan realizes must explain the vision earlier. He also says these visions are telling Professor Ikarus that Elgyem wants to stay with him. After they leave, the gang sees a UFO zigzagging through the sky which cannot be explained.",

While they wait, Iris and Ash explore the surrounding forest where they accidentally come across Trip who is using his new Vanilite on a wild Palpitoad. Ash gets in the way of the Pok\u00e9 Ball, allowing Palpitoad to escape. When Iris arrives, Trip is fascinated by her, saying that he's always wanted to meet someone from the Dragon Village, and snaps a few photos with his trademark camera. When Iris sees the Vanilite, she acts very scared of its presence, knowing how Ice-type Pok\u00e9mon are strong against Dragon-types. Trip tells her this logic does not make sense, because in her logic, she should be afraid of dragon types, too, as dragon types are weak against other dragon types, and yet, she keeps Axew so close to her. Trip challenges her to a battle (with Ash repeatedly challenging Trip in the background, and Trip ignoring him), but Iris, remembering how her Excadrill refuses to battle and Emolga refuses to listen to her, awkwardly refuses. Trip says to her that she'll never be a Dragon Master at this rate and starts to leave. Before Trip leaves, Ash challenges him to a battle once more. Initially, Trip refuses, taunting Ash by saying that his Pok\u00e9mon will level down if he battles Ash. Iris taunts him back, and calls him a little kid. Trip accepts the battle request from Ash. Trip sends out his Servine while Ash sends out Snivy. Snivy is defeated quickly, and then Trip recalls how a meeting with Alder when he was younger inspired him to become a strong Pok\u00e9mon trainer. The next match is Timburr against Oshawott. During the fight, Trip takes a photo of Oshawott in an Aqua Jet, revealing that Oshawott does not look where it is going during the move as he does not open his eyes underwater, while Timburr looks on Oshawott's failed Aqua Jet with pity. In the end, Oshawott defeats Timburr with a Razor Shell. The next match is between Vanilite and Tepig. Vanilite is eventually beat, but Tepig is also knocked out, resulting in a tie.

        "After the battle with Trip, Ash decides to do some special training with Oshawott to get him to open his eyes underwater. They go to a lake, but when Ash forces Oshawott's eyes open while they are swimming, he gets upset and uses Water gun on Ash and blows him out of the lake. At their campsite, Iris is watching over the other Pok\u00e9mon while they are playing a game. As Emolga and Snivy get in a fight, Scraggy wanders off and finds a group of Foongus that he angers by using headbutt. The Foongus use Poison Powder that hits all of the Pok\u00e9mon. Cilan, Ash, and Oshawott go out to find a herb that will cure the poison, but it only grows at the bottom of a lake. Ash takes Oshawott with him into the lake, where they are spotted by a wild Palpitoad, angered because of its encounter with Trip. The Palpitoad instructs a school of Tympole to attack them, and Oshawott cannot fight back because he cannot see them. He holds his own until he gains enough courage and opens up his eyes, scaring the Tympole off. However, Palpitoad calls upon a Stunfisk friend that uses Discharge to force Ash and Oshawott out of the lake. Cilan decides to use his fishing skills to get the Stunfisk out of the water, drawing Palpitoad out as well. Oshawott battles against Palpitoad while Cilan uses his fishing rod to get Stunfisk KO'd. Oshawott finally is able to defeat Palpitoad when he opens his eyes during Aqua Jet, allowing Ash to capture Palpitoad while Cilan captures Stunfisk. Oshawott dives into the lake once more and finds the herb, which they bring back to camp to heal the others. Oshawott manages to earn the full respect and gratitude of all the Pok\u00e9mon.",

        "While on the way to Nimbasa City, the group comes across a trainer named Georgia who claims that she is a Dragon Buster and can beat any Dragon-type Pok\u00e9mon. Iris challenges her, saying that she is training to be a Dragon Master. Langley sends out her Beartic, with Iris afraid, but sending out Axew to fight it. Axew is easily beaten, and Iris sends out Excadrill next, but he will not obey her orders. Georgia taunts her before she leaves. As Iris tries to comfort Excadrill, he curls up into inactive mode once more. Iris tells Ash and Cilan that like long ago, this time, Excadrill was defeated by the move Rock Smash. She tells Ash and Cilan how she captured Excadrill when she first found him as a Drilbur bothering other Pok\u00e9mon in the forest around her home town many years ago. After she saved him after he nearly fell off a cliff, Drilbur became Iris's partner and trained under her, eventually evolving into an Excadrill and winning a tournament in her home. Drayden, a Dragon Master, tells Iris that he is impressed. She challenges him to a battle, and says it will be their 100th victory, and she wants it to be against a Dragon Master. He accepts her challenge, but when Excadrill fights Shaga's Haxorus, none of its moves appear effective, and he loses the match. Upset, Excadrill shut itself off from Iris and has not listened to her. Cilan says that it is not disappointment that is causing Excadrill's behavior but anger at Iris for forcing it to fight a match that he knew that he would lose. That night, Iris apologizes to Excadrill, saying that she did not try to understand his feelings. Excadrill listens in surprise, remembering how Iris never gave up trying to beat him, and her words of encouragement. He moves out of its inactive mode, but Iris is already asleep. Excadrill goes into the woods to practice its Focus Blast move, until Iris wakes up and sees it, deciding to help him master the move. The next day, Georgia comes across the group again after she has eaten their breakfast, and Iris challenges her to a match, again. With Excadrill's trust once again formed with Iris, and his newly learned Focus Blast, he is now an even match for Georgia's Beartic, but both defeat each other at the same time, resulting in a tie. Georgia, although upset, still claims she is a Dragon Buster. she tells Iris to meet her again one day in battle, and Cilan to prepare a better meal for her. Iris comforts Excadrill in the draw, saying it was a great battle. Excadrill hugs her, and she hugs back, saying that she loves Excadrill.

Drayden, a Dragon Master, tells Iris that he is impressed. She challenges him to a battle, and says it will be their 100th victory, and she wants it to be against a Dragon Master. He accepts her challenge, but when Excadrill fights Shaga's Haxorus, none of its moves appear effective, and he loses the match. Upset, Excadrill shut itself off from Iris and has not listened to her. Cilan says that it is not disappointment that is causing Excadrill's behavior but anger at Iris for forcing it to fight a match that he knew that he would lose. That night, Iris apologizes to Excadrill, saying that she did not try to understand his feelings. Excadrill listens in surprise, remembering how Iris never gave up trying to beat him, and her words of encouragement. He moves out of its inactive mode, but Iris is already asleep. Excadrill goes into the woods to practice its Focus Blast move, until Iris wakes up and sees it, deciding to help him master the move. The next day, Georgia comes across the group again after she has eaten their breakfast, and Iris challenges her to a match, again. With Excadrill's trust once again formed with Iris, and his newly learned Focus Blast, he is now an even match for Georgia's Beartic, but both defeat each other at the same time, resulting in a tie. Georgia, although upset, still claims she is a Dragon Buster. she tells Iris to meet her again one day in battle, and Cilan to prepare a better meal for her. Iris comforts Excadrill in the draw, saying it was a great battle. Excadrill hugs her, and she hugs back, saying that she loves Excadrill. In the end, Excadrill and Iris are once again good friends.",
        "While on the way to Nimbasa City, the group comes across a trainer named Georgia who claims that she is a Dragon Buster and can beat any Dragon-type Pok\u00e9mon. Iris challenges her, saying that she is training to be a Dragon Master. Langley sends out her Beartic, with Iris afraid, but sending out Axew to fight it. Axew is easily beaten, and Iris sends out Excadrill next, but he will not obey her orders. Georgia taunts her before she leaves. As Iris tries to comfort Excadrill, he curls up into inactive mode once more. Iris tells Ash and Cilan that like long ago, this time, Excadrill was defeated by the move Rock Smash. She tells Ash and Cilan how she captured Excadrill when she first found him as a Drilbur bothering other Pok\u00e9mon in the forest around her home town many years ago.

        "While the gang enjoys a lunch, they are interrupted by a Roggenrola landing on their lunch table. Ash decides he wants to capture it, for the energy and spunk it has, but it manages to defeat both Oshawott and Tepig. Cilan notices a strange suction cup on the back of Roggenrola, which is knocked off in the battle. At the Pok\u00e9mon Center, Ash has Oshawott and Tepig taken care of when a man named Mr. Garrason talks to Nurse Joy and informs her that the water lines seems normal, and the cause is elsewhere. Nurse Joy informs Ash and friends that the water supply has been strange since morning, and tells them that the water supply comes from a cave where Roggenrola. They say they saw a Roggenrola earlier that day, but Nurse Joy tells them that they rarely come out of the caves. Cilan says that the Roggenrola was attempting to tell them something, and also remembers the strange object on its back. Mr. Garrason says he will go to the caves to look, and Ash and his friends volunteer to follow. Elsewhere, the same Roggenrola warns several wild Pok\u00e9mon about something, and inside a cave, a strange device driven by Team Rocket chases after several Roggenrola. Ash, Iris, Cilan, and Mr. Garrason enter the cave which is supposed to deliver water to the Pok\u00e9mon Center to see why the Roggenrola are acting strange when they come across Team Rocket who capture the Roggenrola the gang encountered earlier to fill up the device. Ash manages to save that Roggenrola from Team Rocket, who exit the cave, but smash the cave walls, causing a cave-in. A rock falls towards Ash, but Roggenrola saves him by using Flash Cannon. As Team Rocket exits the cave, they fire an energy blast from the Roggenrola Cannon to cause a cave in at the entrance. Pansage and Excadrill use Dig to get the gang outside, where they chase down Team Rocket who try to use the Roggenrola Cannon to escape once more. They fire the cannon and Roggenrola intercepts the blast with Flash Cannon. Team Rocket fires a second time, however, the device backfires, due to the Roggenrola forcing the energy into reverse causing the machine to break down. The Roggenrola are freed, and with combined attacks from all the Roggenrola, Pikachu, and Tepig, they defeat Team Rocket's Pok\u00e9mon, and destroy the machine, forcing Team Rocket to flee on jetpacks. At the Pok\u00e9mon Center, Nurse Joy checks on all of the Roggenrola and Tepig, revealing that they are healthy, and the one Roggenrola that Ash first saved reveals it wanted to travel with Ash from the moment they met.

They begin the revival process using Fennel's Musharna which wakes up Archen. However, it is restless and begins to attack everyone. Meanwhile Team Rocket decide to steal the Archen, along with the data for constructing a restoration machine. As Archen is sleeping, the professors are pondering what having an Archen in this modern world is like. As it wakes up, it starts to destroy the lab and its crying causes an ancient plant to start growing in the lab. It starts to search for food only to discover that Cilan's Pok\u00e9mon food and the food growing in trees don't taste good. Archen decides that it wants to fly, only to find out it cannot. Ash and Iris offer to help it, however Iris' Emolga starts off by using Attract, which fails and only makes Archen poke at her. She responds by using Volt Switch and switches out with Cilan's Stunfisk. After a long stare between Archen and Stunfisk, it bites Stunfisk out of curiosity and Stunfisk responds by using Discharge on it. Archen cries loudly, once again, causing the plants to grow again. Archen continues to try to fly, eventually starting to become successful, all the while releasing its cries. Eventually the plants consume the lab and begin to grow the fruit that Archen likes. It eats them and evolves into Archeops and begins to fly. After Team Rocket steals the design of the restoration device, they decide to go capture Archeops. They destroy the plants and capture Archeops in an electrically charged net. Archeops retaliates, forcing Team Rocket to retreat.

Ash and Iris offer to help it, however Iris' Emolga starts off by using Attract, which fails and only makes Archen poke at her. She responds by using Volt Switch and switches out with Cilan's Stunfisk. After a long stare between Archen and Stunfisk, it bites Stunfisk out of curiosity and Stunfisk responds by using Discharge on it. Archen cries loudly, once again, causing the plants to grow again. Archen continues to try to fly, eventually starting to become successful, all the while releasing its cries. Eventually the plants consume the lab and begin to grow the fruit that Archen likes. It eats them and evolves into Archeops and begins to fly. After Team Rocket steals the design of the restoration device, they decide to go capture Archeops.

        "Stopping on their way to Nimbasa City for a lunch break, Axew and Tepig discover Team Rocket's Meowth unconscious in the bushes. The gang revives him back to health. When he wakes up, he discovers that the gang has revived him and he explains that Team Rocket has fired him for botching an operation. They decide to take Meowth along for a while. Continuing their journey, Meowth sweet talks Ash and Iris but Pikachu is still suspicious of him. Shortly after, a Scrafty snatches Axew and runs off. They give chase but Scrafty threatens that if they get closer, bad things will happen to Axew. Meowth offers to negotiate the problem. Scrafty wants a Pok\u00e9mon to help battle him.

Meowth und Scraggy distract Scrafty while Ash and Snivy pull Axew out. After it realizes what is happening, Pikachu issues a quick Thunderbolt to knock it out. Scrafty quickly wakes up and reveals it wants to battle and Ash uses Tepig. They battle it out and Tepig knocks it out once again. It then cries explaining that its home was taken by another Pok\u00e9mon and that it asked for help from other Pok\u00e9mon but they all refused, which is why Scrafty snatched Axew. It turns out that a Mandibuzz has stolen its lair. Ash uses Scraggy and defeat Mandibuzz, but then it starts to cry because it was kicked out of its nest because it ate all of its friend's food. When they go to apologize, the other Mandibuzz attacks but the first Mandibuzz gives the other Mandibuzz some berries and all is forgiven and restored back to the way it was. The day ends with them continuing on their journey and Iris attempting to capture Meowth. Team Rocket has arrived at Anville Town's train dock where the trains are parked and prepare for their next phase of the plan.",

It claims it can grant any wish. Cilan reveals that he wanted to cook something spicy for the night's meal, but he has the wrong berries.

They discuss what to wish for next, but do not have any until Cilan decides to wish for an extravagant place to sleep. Beheeyem tells the gang to follow it and it makes a luxurious palace appear.

She asks the gang if they are missing anything and they realize that all of their Pok\u00e9mon are missing. They immediately chase after a mysterious man until a bunch of jail bars appear in front of them. The man from earlier comes out and claims that he is the grand dream thief Leon. Officer Jenny explains that the gang are trapped inside Beheeyem's dream and that everything there is not real. Officer Jenny explains that all the mysterious events happening is a result of Beheeyem and that they cannot save the Pok\u00e9mon unless they escape the dream. She explains that in order to leave the dream, everyone in it needs to realize that it is a dream and that they have to attack an emergency exit sign to get out. Iris spots it in a painting and Officer Jenny tells her Duosion to use Psywave on it, freeing themselves. They see Leon and they begin to battle but seem to be unable to hurt Beheeyem.

While Meowth goes to collect firewood, a very strange person proclaims that he is going to capture Meowth and Pikachu and sends a Beeheyem to help collect firewood and befriend the gang. It claims it can grant any wish. Cilan reveals that he wanted to cook something spicy for the night's meal, but he has the wrong berries. Meowth asks Beheeyem to get some Figy Berries and it grants the wish. That night, they eat the overly spicy meal. They discuss what to wish for next, but do not have any until Cilan decides to wish for an extravagant place to sleep. Beheeyem tells the gang to follow it and it makes a luxurious palace appear. They are led to their rooms where they immediately jump on the bed and fall asleep. During the night, Officer Jenny appears to them and introduces herself as a specialist in Psychic crimes. She asks the gang if they are missing anything and they realize that all of their Pok\u00e9mon are missing. They immediately chase after a mysterious man until a bunch of jail bars appear in front of them. The man from earlier comes out and claims that he is the grand dream thief Leon. Officer Jenny explains that the gang are trapped inside Beheeyem's dream and that everything there is not real. Officer Jenny explains that all the mysterious events happening is a result of Beheeyem and that they cannot save the Pok\u00e9mon unless they escape the dream. She explains that in order to leave the dream, everyone in it needs to realize that it is a dream and that they have to attack an emergency exit sign to get out. Iris spots it in a painting and Officer Jenny tells her Duosion to use Psywave on it, freeing themselves. They see Leon and they begin to battle but seem to be unable to hurt Beheeyem. When they realize that there are two moons in the sky, they realize that they are still in the dream. The gang wake up their Pok\u00e9mon but Meowth will not wake up so Ash has Pikachu use Thunderbolt on him. They try to use the emergency escape to get out, once more, but a UFO appears and Leon appears to be an alien. They realize there are now three moons and realize Meowth was still asleep when they left. Pikachu uses Thunderbolt again to wake him up and they try to leave the dream again. This time Leon and Beheeyem are super-sized and start chasing the gang. They realize Meowth is asleep, again, and lying on top of one of the hundreds of moons in the sky. Pikachu, Axew, and Duosion try to wake him up again by using Thunderbolt, Dragon Rage, and Psywave respectively, but accidentally knock him out. They stuff a bunch of Figy Berries into his mouth and wake him and, once again, they try to use the emergency exit to get out. They then realize that there is only one moon and that they are out of the dream. Leon tries to put them to sleep, again, but Pikachu uses Electro Ball to knock Beheeyem out. He takes off but is stopped by Meowth. Leon is locked up and the Pok\u00e9 Balls are returned safely. Meowth realizes that they could have hitched a ride with Officer Jenny and realize that they still have to sleep outside.

        "On a thundery evening, some Beartic have taken cover in a cave, being too frightened to go to sleep. One of the Beartic loses its child Cubchoo when it falls off of a cliff into the forest below. Ash and the gang are continuing their journey when they come across a sick Cubchoo, realizing how badly damaged the forest is. They come across a Beartic that starts to attack them. Soon they find many of them that are angry. Meowth decides to play negotiator and the Beartic use Icy Wind on him. When they want to attack again, a Mienfoo appears and knocks them out. A Forest Ranger named Cliff introduces himself to the gang. He is quite amazed at Meowth for his abilities to talk. The Cubchoo explains to Meowth exactly what happened before they found it, and Cliff tells them that there are two tribes of Beartic living on the mountain. Cliff asks if Meowth belongs to anybody. When everyone says no, he throws a Pok\u00e9 Balls at him and nearly captures him, much to Meowth's chagrin. They set out to find the Beartic that the Cubchoo belongs to until they are attacked by the Beartic. They quickly distract the Beartic and run. Meowth decides to be a negotiator and dodges the first Icy Wind but gets hit by the second one. They run away but fall off of a cliff and get separated from their Pok\u00e9mon. At the subway station, the Subway Masters are investigating what is going on in the Subway. The Pok\u00e9mon set out to find food for Axew and Cubchoo. The gang, in the meantime, searches for the Pok\u00e9mon. They walk through a completely destroyed forest where one of the Beartic groups lived. In the meantime, the Pok\u00e9mon find food lying on a tree trunk and decide to take it. They walk back to feed Axew and Cubchoo, while a group of Beartic return to find that their food stolen. The gang walks through yet another destroyed forest until they come across a Beartic group. Meanwhile, Meowth is arguing with the Beartic about the stolen food and he returns them to the Beartic, before getting hit by Icy Wind. Suddenly, the two Beartic groups meet and they begin to fight each other, firing Sheer Cold attacks at each other, but their fighting causes four boulders to roll down the mountain at them. Three of the four are destroyed by the gang's Pok\u00e9mon, while the Beartic all use Sheer Cold to freeze the remaining one in place. The two Beartic groups now get along with each other. After departing from Cliff, the gang continues their journey to Nimbasa City. Meanwhile, Team Rocket is preparing their final stage of their mission in Nimbasa City.",

Cilan, being very excited, asks the gang to lead the way. They head to a subway station where Cilan claims he is a Metro Sommelier. When they go into the station, Cilan looks at one of the model cars on display and begins an overly long explanation of the car. After they cannot bear to hear anymore, Meowth drags him away and they walk to the subway tracks. Cilan, again, is losing himself with trains and begins to embarrass the gang as he explains how the trains work. Suddenly the emergency brakes kick in on the train as a ghost train passes the train they are in. Suddenly the Subway Masters, Emmet and Ingo appear on the train and get it going again. They resume the ride to Nimbasa Central. Cilan begins to get angry at the people driving the ghost train and once again, Meowth drags him away. The gang head to the Pok\u00e9mon Center where Meowth, Pikachu, and Axew as well as Ash's other Pok\u00e9mon go to get pampered. It occurs to Meowth that he has forgotten to do something. He enters a phone booth to call Team Rocket to give them the go ahead. Meowth returns and they go to the treatment spas. Ash decides to call Professor Oak's.

Meanwhile, the drawbridge to Driftveil City is raised and the shorted out. Meowth begins to dump the Pok\u00e9 Balls down the air shaft, connected to Team Rocket's train, and begins loading them on.

Nurse Joy, Cilan, Iris, and Ash head to the security vault to find that all the Pok\u00e9 Balls are missing, including Pikachu and Axew, as well as Meowth. Meantime, Meowth regroups with Team Rocket and Dr. Zager who has begun hacking the train system, causing all the subway trains to freeze in place and stop responding. When Cilan, Iris, and Ash find Meowth, they realize that Meowth has betrayed them and was never fired from Team Rocket in the first place.

When they close in on it, Ash jumps on it and it begins to deflate and explode, derailing the carriage train. They realize that it was a fake train meant to distract them.

When Cilan, Iris, and Ash find Meowth, they realize that Meowth has betrayed them and was never fired from Team Rocket in the first place. Team Rocket forces them out of the way and drive away with the train loaded with the Pok\u00e9mon. Ash and his friends regroup with the Subway Masters and they head to the mail carriage train. They drive to the point where Team Rocket has to pass through and catch up with their train. When they close in on it, Ash jumps on it and it begins to deflate and explode, derailing the carriage train. They realize that it was a fake train meant to distract them. When the Subway Masters regain control of the sensors, they notice a train heading for the junction and realize it is Team Rocket as they drive right past them. They claim they can track their location at all times, but as soon as Team Rocket passes the point, the trains showing up in the system begin to multiply.",
        "The gang has finally arrived in Nimbasa City after a long and hard journey. Everyone agrees to go to the Pok\u00e9mon Center but Ash wants a Gym Battle right away, until his stomach growls. Cilan, being very excited, asks the gang to lead the way. They head to a subway station where Cilan claims he is a Metro Sommelier. When they go into the station, Cilan looks at one of the model cars on display and begins an overly long explanation of the car. After they cannot bear to hear anymore, Meowth drags him away and they walk to the subway tracks. Cilan, again, is losing himself with trains and begins to embarrass the gang as he explains how the trains work. Suddenly the emergency brakes kick in on the train as a ghost train passes the train they are in. Suddenly the Subway Masters, Emmet and Ingo appear on the train and get it going again. They resume the ride to Nimbasa Central. Cilan begins to get angry at the people driving the ghost train and once again, Meowth drags him away. The gang head to the Pok\u00e9mon Center where Meowth, Pikachu, and Axew as well as Ash's other Pok\u00e9mon go to get pampered. It occurs to Meowth that he has forgotten to do something. He enters a phone booth to call Team Rocket to give them the go ahead. Meowth returns and they go to the treatment spas. Ash decides to call Professor Oak's. Suddenly the communication lines are cut by Team Rocket's Dr. Zager. Meowth begins operations in stealing the Pok\u00e9mon from the Pok\u00e9mon Center. Meanwhile, the drawbridge to Driftveil City is raised and the shorted out. Meowth begins to dump the Pok\u00e9 Balls down the air shaft, connected to Team Rocket's train, and begins loading them on. Suddenly, everyone in Nimbasa City is confused and Cilan suggests that someone is trying to steal the Pok\u00e9mon.

Ash suggests inspecting them one by one until they find the right one. Meanwhile, Dr. Zager is planning on rendezvousing with Jessie and James at a designated location. Cilan suggests that Team Rocket is planning to meet outside of the subway and that they are on they are on their way to the Anville Town rail yard. Meanwhile, Pikachu begins to call out other Pok\u00e9mon to break out of the train. The Subway Masters rendezvous with the gang and plan to drive out of the underground subway station to catch up to Team Rocket, just as the Pok\u00e9mon have finally cut a hole through the door of the train. Meowth goes to check up on the Pok\u00e9mon only to see that Pikachu has broken free. Pikachu realizes that Meowth has been lying all along and gets infuriated. The Pok\u00e9mon work together to destroy the coupling of the train to separate themselves from Team Rocket, forcing them to chase after the train car. When Ash and the others arrive, they see that Dr. Zager is preparing to lift the train car holding the Pok\u00e9mon with a helicopter and take it away. Ash decides to go over to the train car and help them out. Using a Chandelure's psycic powers, he is transported over to the train car. They outrace Team Rocket until they manage to destroy the clamps on the helicopter. Jessie and James take over the capturing process and begin to speed up. They, again, use the Pok\u00e9mon to speed up the trailer when Ash's Tepig learns Flamethrower. They attack the train and the path starts to short circuit. Pikachu, still infuriated at Meowth for lying, watches Team Rocket fly away on jetpacks and is about to pursue them (mainly Meowth), but, not before thanking Meowth for traveling with them, Ash manages to calm Pikachu down telling him to let it go for now, while the train destroys itself, as they safely arrive in Anville Town's rail yard. The Subway Masters inform everyone that the Pok\u00e9 Balls will be safely returned to everyone. Ash becomes excited for his gym battle and cannot wait to return to Nimbasa City.",
