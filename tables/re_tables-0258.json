        "As Mrs. Q drives Aya and Yuhi to school, Aya has a vision of a girl burning. Nearby they find Yuki Urakawa, a classmate, unconscious. As Yuhi and Aya discuss what to do, she awakens and says she wants to go to school. They take her to the infirmary. Toya is there working as a school doctor, having been given fake memories by Kagami. He tells Aya she should have nothing more to do with him, as he only wants Ceres. As they return the infirmary, they discover the school nurse has burned alive. Aya later discovers that Yuki is having an affair with one of the school doctors. She promises Yuki she will keep her secret, but the doctor overhears them talking and tells Yuki that they can never see each other again because Aya has told. An explosion rocks the school, and Aya gets lost in the ensuing fire. As the smoke overtakes her, Toya appears and takes her to the school pool. When she asks why, he kisses her and tells her he suddenly found himself looking for her. He wonders if that's love and says he must find out who he is so they don't end up hurting each other. A furious Yuhi arrives and orders Toya to get away from Aya. Before he leaves, Toya tells them both that Kagami is gathering up all those who have the celestial maiden genes, C-genomes, as part of the C Project. Yuki arrives and attacks Aya with her pyrokinetic powers and abilities. Yuhi blocks the attack, getting burned himself, and both of them are thrown into the pool. Ceres emerges from within Aya and tries to attack the doctor controlling Yuki, but Yuki stops her, begging Ceres not to hurt him. The doctor gets angry at Yuki for being unable to fight Ceres. Hurt by his words, Yuki cries remembering how he told her he loved her before. She holds on to him and envelops them both in flames, killing him. Aya regains control of her body, and to her relief finds Yuki hurt, but alive, behind her. At the Mikage Corporation, Kagami shackles Toya and forbids him from leaving the building, until Toya can stop playing \"little love games\" with Aya.",

Aya is annoyed by Tomonori, Yuhi's brother, seeming lack of concern over Yuhi, but Tomonori only responds by flirting with her. Yuhi comes to the room and he vaguely thanks his father for coming, then tells them to leave as \"that woman\" would be upset if he was there. Tomonori lashes back that Yuhi is just the abandoned son of a mistress, and has no right to refer to his father's wife as \"that woman.\" Suzumi rides back with her father-in-law and Tomonori to the main Aogiri house, while Yuhi explains why he lied about his mother dying, and that only his brother Kazuma was the only one in the main family who seemed to love him. Yuhi says he doesn't need a family, since he was abandoned, but Aya cries at him for saying such sad things. She reminds him no one can survive alone and that he will find someone to romantically love just as much. Yuhi tells her he wants her to be that person, and pushes her to the floor, kissing her. Aya pushes him away, and he yells that he loves her, then holds her down as he kisses her again. Mrs. Q interrupts Aya and Yuhi, and after she's gone he apologizes for his behavior.

        "Strange glasses are put on Suzumi, connecting her to a nearby machine. Aya realizes Suzumi has been captured by the Mikages and she, with Yuhi, head to the main house. The machine feeds Suzumi memories of her late husband, Kazuma. Yuhi and Aya are able to defeat the men outside, but inside they are stopped when one of the men puts a gun to Yuhi's father's head. Aya and Yuhi are tasered. Yuhi tries to awaken Suzumi by calling out to her, but she can't hear them. One of the Mikage men shoots at Yuhi to shut him up, but Yuhi's father blocks the shot, getting hit in the shoulder instead. Realizing they can't do anything, Aya willingly calls to Ceres for help. Ceres quickly dispatches the man and destroys the machinery, but Suzumi doesn't awaken. Entrenched in her memories, Suzumi will only wake up if she is willing to return to reality. As they listen to Suzumi talking in her sleep, Ceres and the Aogiris discover that Suzumi was three months pregnant and had miscarried when Kazuma died. Crying, Yuhi continues trying to call out to her and eventually his voice reaches her. After Kazuma's death and the loss of their unborn baby, Suzumi had attempted suicide, but was stopped by Yuhi. Remembering she had a brother who needed her the will to live, and remembering that moment that enables her to wake up from the dream. At the Mikage headquarters, Aki demands to speak with Toya. Kagami agrees and asks Toya to choose between Aya and his memories. Toya says he chooses Aya. Aki frees Toya from his handcuffs, thanking him for protecting Aya. As he talks, Aki's tone changes and he stabs Toya with one of the handcuffs saying that he will never give Aya to him or anyone else. Aki returns to himself when Kagami touches him, leaving Aki upset at what he had done. In the car, Ceres and Yuhi talk, and she has him promise to show him the truth about people, as she has no trust in them. Aya returns, and she promises she will stop the C-Project, and that she will rely on Ceres to help her from now on.",

She had seen him flying with Ceres the month before, and wants them to come to Tochigi to meet her brother, Shota. Shota, who has paralyzed for the last two years, was hospitalized three days before after being afflicted by the bacteria. Chidori wants Aya to fly with Shota, to help keep him from giving up on his dreams of being a pilot. Aya promises to take him flying. In one of the waiting areas, Yuhi is holding her when Toya appears, working as a doctor in the hospital. He doesn't say anything and walks past them. Aya follows and asks him about the bacteria, and why he isn't bother by Yuhi holding her. Toya says he can only give what he knows. Aya kisses him on the lips, and tells him to show her his feelings towards her by warmly embracing her. The next day, Aya overhears Toya and Shota talking about Toya being alone and never feeling sad because he never had anything precious, until now and that he's afraid he will hurt her by being near her. Aya goes to meet with Toya, but Ceres demands to come out. Aya is afraid Ceres will attack him, but stops resisting and allows Ceres to emerge. Ceres asks Toya what he is and tells him that if he really strongly loves and cares about Aya, he needs to get away from the Mikage. She also says she feels she has seen him somewhere before, but doesn't know if the memories are hers or Aya's. As the sun sets, she gives him Aya's choker, telling him to wear it instead of the one from Mikage if he truly, deeply does love and care for Aya. Ceres then goes to Yuhi and the others, so she can take Shota on the promised flight. During the flight, one of the patients infected by the bacteria awakens their dormant celestial powers and abilities, sending out a tremendously strong destructive blast of bright pink-colored energy that knocks Shota out of Ceres' arms.",

        "Toya gives Aya the letter from Aki. He prepares to return to the Mikage building to persuade Aki to leave, but she stops him, saying that he will die. Toya says he does not mind, but Yuhi scolds him, telling him not to make Aya any sadder. Back at the Aogiri house, Aya cries as she rereads Aki's letter. A convalescing Toya asks whether it was all right for him to come to the Aogiris', and Aya begins to explain that it was Yuhi who allowed it. They are interrupted by Yuhi bringing in a tray of food. Aya follows him out of the room and apologizes for not reciprocating Yuhi's strong and true romantic feelings, but he stops her. He says he will stand aside for now, but swears that if Toya ever hurts Aya, he'll take her away. Toya appears behind them and promises to give his all to Aya, if that is what she wants. Alone in his room again, Toya confesses to Aya that he has been scared all this while, but now he's found his own secure place. He shows her how he can make a short dagger blade appear and disappear out of his wrist at will. He asks what kind of a human can he be, with such an unnatural power and ability. Aya decides that she wants to relieve him of his burden of sadness and loneliness. Later after her bath Aya's conscience and other self, Ceres, appears in a mirror and asks Aya to let her take over her mind and body so that she can destroy the Mikage family, to punish them for taking the lives of so many innocent lives only to increase their own strength and power. Aya refuses and promises instead to get back the celestial robe, as long as Ceres does not hurt Aki. Ceres warns her that Aki will not be coming back, and that \"that man\", too has been reborn and reincarnated is already taking over. Aya visits her mother at the hospital and reads Aki's letter to her. As she leaves, she discovers that Aki has written a message inside the envelope, asking Aya to kill him if he is taken over. Aki goes to visit his grandfather. They go into a sealed vault that contains Ceres' mummy, the guardian deity of the Mikage family. The sight of the relic inflicts scars on Aki once more, the mark of the Progenitor himself, who had been slashed to death by Ceres. Aki has been fully taken over by the spirit of the Progenitor. His delighted grandfather declares that Aki is his successor, the one who will protect the family against Ceres' celestial curse and make the Mikage family even stronger and more powerful. Aki growls that he's being noisy and kills him. Looking at the mummy he says this is just her empty shell and demands to know where his woman, Ceres, is.",

Miori reveals that she is Aya's cousin and that her mother was killed by Aya/Ceres on her sixteenth birthday. Aki tells Toya that his memories as Toya Mizuki are false and tries to kill Toya. Deep within her mental cocoon, Aya hears Aki's voice telling her not to run away. Aya returns and calls out to Toya, who gets the strength to fend off Aki. Toya tears off the Mikage collar and protects her from Miori. Miori tells Toya of her wish that they could live together happily with his fake past, then flies up to the roof of the building and throws herself off before Toya can stop her. Aya is deeply scarred by the incident and refuses to eat. Toya goes to the Aogiri residence and tells Suzumi that he still cannot remember Aya. He goes to the sleeping Aya and leaves his dagger with her so they will always be together. Toya then sets off in search of his real self, with the flicker of a true memory as his guide."

He tells the doctor that he was travelling around beaches in search of his memory of the ocean, was chased by thugs and dumped into the sea. The doctor orders him to stay until he recovers and can work off his bill. Toya sneaks out and is fired on by Wei's men, but is found by the doctor before they can get to him. Aya visits her mother in hospital and finds Aki there. Aki takes her captive and, back at the Mikage building, tries to rape her. Toya's dagger sends out a pulse of energy and throws Aki off.

After forcing the men to jump into the sea, he leaps onto the roof of the truck and lets the helicopter crash. He goes in to rescue Aya and Howell releases her. Howell tells Toya that he cannot ask for forgiveness or even understanding, and that they just wanted her cooperation in ensuring the survival of the human race. Toya brings Aya to a desolate shack and waits for the drug to wear off. According to Howell, the drug should wear off at 4 a.m. If not, Aya will never wake up from her dream state. When she doesn't wake up at the appointed time, Toya cries. Ceres tells Aya that Toya is calling for her, and Aya finally wakes up.

Kagami reveals that he himself is obsessed with Ceres' \"perfection\", and has been since fifth grade when he found an old picture of Ceres emerging from a Mikage girl. Aya explains to her unconscious mother that she is going to live with Toya, and Toya assures her that he will protect Aya. Her mother reacts for the first time with a squeeze of their hands. Aya and Toya then return to Niigata to thank the doctor for looking after Toya. They stay and find work in Niigata.

Afterwards, he spends hours staring out at sea. Walking along the beach, Aya finds a shell and holds it out for Toya to see. This seems to trigger a memory in Toya, and he urgently asks her to remember an island. She recalls that her family once vacationed at Hachijo Island ten years ago when she was six years old. They go to the island, where Aya remembers seeing an already grown-up Toya and offering him a shell. Toya's memories return, and he recounts how an old hermit on the island once found a baby encased in a membrane. Astonishingly, the baby grew rapidly to a fully-grown man. The process took ten days, hence Toya's name (\"tenth night\"). The old man forbade Toya to leave the island, and Toya is content with that until he meets the young Aya. Upon the old man's death, he leaves the island to search for Aya but is struck by a car. In his amnesiac state, he remembers only her last name - \"Mikage\" - and his own, \"Toya\". He wanders to the Mikage building and is taken in by Kagami and trained as one of his men.

Another example, a person would say \"I didn't know mar\"; which somewhat has the same meaning as \"I didn't know la\" but is softer than \"la\".

        "Lah/La/Lor A popular suffix to phrases and sentences. Originates from Chinese language (and its dialects) where its usage is grammatically correct, for instance, (cantonese) \"M hou gam yeung la\" would literally mean \"Don't be like that\", except that there is an extra word at the end, \"la\". Another example: \"cannot, lah\", i.e.\"Sorry that's not possible.\" and \"Rest some more-lah.\", i.e. \"Please rest for a while longer,\"; It is important to note that the tone of which the prefx s spoken greatly affects the context of the statement. Example, saying \"Okay -lah\" while squinting one eye and hesitating the -lah, would be to give a mediocre opinion about something (as in \"The food was okay-lah\"). Meanwhile, to say a short increasing pitched -lah as in \"Okay -lah. We'll all go to Ipoh later\", would be to agree about something. \"Lah\" is also generally used to soften an otherwise angry/stern tone, such as: \"Stop it lah\" as opposed to just an abrupt \"Stop it!\", or \"Don't be like that la\" as opposed to \"Don't be like that\". It is usually perceived as less insulting when a \"lah\" is added in sentences such as those, and typically means that the person uttering the sentence is not angry, unless of course, it is said in a harsh tone.",

The 4th ranked brawler shows up and challenges them to a battle. Surprisingly, Dan opens his Gate Card at the same time as Runo, Marucho and Julio and is dragged into the battle. Julio insists they both take him and his Haos Tentaclear on. The battle gets intense and once again Drago's power level goes up without Dan's assistance at all. The battle ends with Dan and Runo winning and Runo and Marucho return with Dan to the other brawlers. The brawlers comment on how Masquerade is still on his quest to find the ultimate bakugan. Drago states that if the silent core has fused with the ultimate bakugan Naga then it's possible for the infinity core to do the same, with Julie worrying that that bakugan could be Hydranoid. With that in mind the brawlers are determined to make sure that one of their bakugan becomes the ultimate bakugan before Hydranoid."

Throughout the battle Julie is constantly being reminded of how her sister was perfect and no matter how hard she tried she could never be as good as her. With help from Gorem who was on the brink of defeat from Clayf, Julie realizes that she had to stop comparing herself to Daisy and just be herself. Julie's return in confidence allows Gorem to evolve in Subterra Hammer Gorem, winning the battle against Clayf. With Clayf having lost the battle he makes Julie and Gorem the new subterra soldiers.",

Preyas explains that Diablo is Angelo's alter-ego and that Angelo and Diablo are two bakugan in one. Diablo informs Marucho that he not only has aquos attributes but pyrus attributes as well. With Marucho having won the battle he makes peace with his past self and Frasch tells him he shall return him to his friends while calling them his new aquos soldiers."

Just then Shun and Skyress meet a small girl who is looking for someone to play with. When Shun asks what she wants to play she says tag and makes Shun it. Shun and Skyress play with her and when they win the girl starts another game, kick the can. After that the girl brings them to the hill and shows them the sun which makes Shun and Skyress realize that it hasn't moved since they got there. Just then Shun has a flashback from when he was little about his late mother. The little girl then talks about how alone she was before Shun came and tells Shun she has one more game to play with him, bakugan.

Skyress is defeated by Oberus just when Shun realizes his mistake of seeing the little girl as his mother because of their similar personalities.

The Haos Legendary Soldier, Lars Lion, creates a mystical woodland area. Tigrerra and Runo find themselves wondering in a forest full of mist. Runo pleads and wishes that Dan would be here to guide them. Suddenly, a shadowy figure appears. Runo then has a flashback of when she was small with Dan. Then Lars Lion transforms into an old lady and awaits for Runo in a cave. Wondering where they are, the duo stumbles into an old lady. The lady suggests some directions, but Runo is creeped out by her looks and ponders deeper into the woods. After cluelessly strolling in the forest, Runo encounters a little boy. The little boy was in a hurry and steamed off to somewhere. Desperately needing directions, Runo and Tigrerra decide to chase after him. As the two were catching up to him, Runo has the strangest feeling that she has seen the little boy before. As Runo and Tigrerra reach the cottage that is presumed to be the little boy's house, she knocks on the door and out comes the boy. The boy seems to remember Runo, although Runo doesn't. After a while, Runo has a slight flashback of her childhood. She remembers the first time and is then challenged by a young boy (Dan) from her past, that was created by the Lars Lion. The battle tests Runo and her partner Haos Tigrerra, but the real test is for her to admit that she treasures her friendship with the real Dan Kuso. Being stubborn, Runo won't admit anything to Lars Lion. When Tigrerra is being attacked, Runo is forced to admit that she really does treasure Dan, saying \"We are friends forever, Dan!\" By doing this Tigrerra evolves into Haos Blade Tigrerra (which frees herself from Runo's stubbornness) and defeats Lars Lion; thus passing their test.",

As the battle rages on, people from all over the world watch as kids and their Bakugan fight to protect the lives of everyone on the planet, and with the support of everyone the battlers are slowly forcing their enemies back. But, things take a turn for the worse when Naga uses the Silent Core to boost the power of his Bakugan and weaken the others. Not only that, but by using using the Silent Core Naga has finally located Wavern! As the Bakugan from all the battlers are defeated Naga's forces, begin to converge on Wavern's location. Wavern in a last stand puts up a force field to protect the city, but everyone is still giving up until they are reminded that they still have the Battle Brawlers on their side. Wavern and Joe are finally able to contact the Brawlers and tell them that Naga has entered their world. Wavern opens a portal to Earth and the Battle Brawlers use it to return home.",
        "As the Brawlers reach the center of Vestroia, they discover that Naga is no longer there. Meanwhile, Naga appears on Earth to move onto the next phase of his plans. Naga closes the portal that connects Vestroia to Earth, a portal he opened to deliberately lead the Brawlers into and then he begins to open more portals around the world to let in his Bakugan army. Naga's ultimate goal is to capture Wavern and to take the Infinity Core and with the Brawlers out of the picture, it looks like he will succeed. But, Joe doesn't give up and sends a message for help to any and all brawlers willing to fight against Naga and his minions. Battlers from all over the world, including top brawlers Chan Lee, Klaus Von Herzon, Billy Gilbert, Komba O'Charlie and Julio Santana, answer Joe's message and with their Bakugan, go on the offensive against Naga and his team. Komba and Harpus lead one group of battlers against Tayghen, while Julio and Tentaclear lead another group against Tricloid and Billy leads a third team against Rabeeder. Meanwhile, Chan and Fortress do a 1-on-1 battle against Centorrior and Klaus leads a fourth team against Druman and Hairadee.

While the Man of Steel does not know Griswald's identity, he sends him a warning via a walkie talkie carried by one of the thieves under the gang leader's command.
