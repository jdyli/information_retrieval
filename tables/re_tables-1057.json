        "Karen and Cook are worried about Freddie's whereabouts. Karen gives Cook Freddie's notebook, which hints that John Foster wants to hurt Effy. The police raid Naomi's house after Cook's one night stand tells them where he is. Cook escapes and flees to Freddie's shed where he meets Effy. The rest of the gang meet there and throw a birthday party for Freddie in his absence. Naomi admits her love for Emily, who in turn takes her back. Cook heads outside briefly where he spots a figure observing Freddie's house and follows it, assuming it to be John Foster. Thomas and Pandora also make up.

Upstairs, the Hollands drift further apart, with Lady Agnes drawn to Caspar Landry, who shows her an exciting world away from Eaton Place, while Sir Hallam becomes distracted by his desire for another woman\u2014and makes a dangerous decision that will change his life forever."

        "It's Alex Henley's first day at college, but he's not worried about fitting in or making new friends. Alex lives his life by the roll of a die, which corresponds to lists of things to do. Alex is living with his elderly grandmother, who is losing her mind. Alex's father has left him with the job of preparing her to be moved to a nursing home. His grandmother rejects the idea and shows great disdain and even dislike for her son, while she is clearly very fond of Alex. When Alex arrives at school, he quickly catches the eye of Liv. Alex punches Alo in the face, due to rolling his die and Alo's unfortunate timing. Liv and Nick witness this and are confused by Alex's behavior, as he immediately is very apologetic to Alo before rushing off. Liv appears both fascinated and amused by the situation. Liv confronts Mini about her distant behavior and the two argue as Mini once again pushes Liv away. Alex watches the argument but then Liv spots him, she confronts him about his \"problem.\" Alex replies that he doesn't have a problem and if you live by the die \"everything's random.\" Liv asks him what his die is telling him to do then and after rolling it, he proceeds to kiss her. Though she slaps him for the kiss, and the two finally introduce themselves. Liv goes back to Alex's house where she meets his grandmother and finds herself touched by the relationship Alex shares with her and the stories of Alex's grandfather who also lived on random luck. Liv leaves and Alex reads to his grandmother until she falls asleep and then goes to meet Liv at pub with the rest of the group. The gang is wary and vaguely hostile towards Alex, particularly Alo who is still irritable over the punch. Alex asks Nick about Grace, who tells him to leave it alone. An upset Mini downs several shots, calls the others boring, and begins to dance with a boy in the pub. She's watched by an uncomfortable Alo which Alex comments about Mini and Alo being a couple, but is \"corrected\" by Liv. Alex rushes out of the pub to answer a phone call that turns out to be his father. Alex is followed out by Liv and the two ditch the pub and Alex takes Liv to go play cards and gamble. Alex wins a huge amount of money, but clearly had cheated and the two grab the money and run. Alex's phone rings and he tells Liv he needs to get home. After Liv leaves, Alex proceeds to have sex with a boy and it is revealed that his character is gay. Later Alex performs various tasks for his grandmother, being constantly bothered by his father. It is implied that he has a fascination with the sea (possibly that his grandfather was lost at sea). He and Liv continue to do as the die says and break and enter a house which turns out to be terribly messy. The two decide to mess with the owners head and clean the place. Liv comes on to Alex and he starts to tell her something, only to be interrupted by the owner of the house and the two flee the scene. Alex and Liv return to Alex's house where they find his father has arrived and is angrily packing Alex's grandmother's things. His father tells Alex to finish and leaves. Alex is upset, but his grandmother convinces him to dance with her and Alex, Liv and his grandmother dance. At the college it is announced that there will be a memorial service for Grace. Liv is disgusted that people who didn't know Grace are mourning her and is adamant that the friends not attend the service. Mini and Liv argue and Liv rushes off crying. She is followed by Alex, but when he tries to comfort her, she kisses him. Alex stops her and tells her he's gay. Liv becomes even more distraught and Alex tries to explain that he's never had friends before. Liv yells at him that they're not friends and Mini arrives to add that \"we don't need you.\" A hurt Alex runs home and discovers that his grandmother has committed suicide by taking sleeping pills. Liv, Mini, and Franky end up attending Grace's memorial service, but are disgusted by the shallow and over-the-top display and end up smashing things up and screaming at the other students. Liv then runs out of the college crying. She receives a call from Alex, who apologizes and asks to make it up to her. He then takes the whole group out on a sailboat for a \"party.\" While on the boat, he encourages Liv to talk to Mini, which she attempts to do, but Mini once again pushes Liv away. Mini then discovers a coffin with Alex's dead grandmother inside. The gang question Alex about the body and he explains that she didn't want to go where others wanted her and pleads the others to help bury her at sea. Alex reads a letter from his grandfather to his grandmother and the boys slide the coffin into the ocean and the gang becomes very emotional, their feelings about Grace welling up. Franky leaves a message on Matty's phone telling him to not to come back. Alex and Liv share another kiss, but it is platonic and they agree to be friends.

        "It's Alex Henley's first day at college, but he's not worried about fitting in or making new friends. Alex lives his life by the roll of a die, which corresponds to lists of things to do. Alex is living with his elderly grandmother, who is losing her mind. Alex's father has left him with the job of preparing her to be moved to a nursing home. His grandmother rejects the idea and shows great disdain and even dislike for her son, while she is clearly very fond of Alex. When Alex arrives at school, he quickly catches the eye of Liv. Alex punches Alo in the face, due to rolling his die and Alo's unfortunate timing. Liv and Nick witness this and are confused by Alex's behavior, as he immediately is very apologetic to Alo before rushing off. Liv appears both fascinated and amused by the situation. Liv confronts Mini about her distant behavior and the two argue as Mini once again pushes Liv away. Alex watches the argument but then Liv spots him, she confronts him about his \"problem.\" Alex replies that he doesn't have a problem and if you live by the die \"everything's random.\" Liv asks him what his die is telling him to do then and after rolling it, he proceeds to kiss her. Though she slaps him for the kiss, and the two finally introduce themselves. Liv goes back to Alex's house where she meets his grandmother and finds herself touched by the relationship Alex shares with her and the stories of Alex's grandfather who also lived on random luck. Liv leaves and Alex reads to his grandmother until she falls asleep and then goes to meet Liv at pub with the rest of the group. The gang is wary and vaguely hostile towards Alex, particularly Alo who is still irritable over the punch. Alex asks Nick about Grace, who tells him to leave it alone. An upset Mini downs several shots, calls the others boring, and begins to dance with a boy in the pub. She's watched by an uncomfortable Alo which Alex comments about Mini and Alo being a couple, but is \"corrected\" by Liv. Alex rushes out of the pub to answer a phone call that turns out to be his father. Alex is followed out by Liv and the two ditch the pub and Alex takes Liv to go play cards and gamble. Alex wins a huge amount of money, but clearly had cheated and the two grab the money and run. Alex's phone rings and he tells Liv he needs to get home. After Liv leaves, Alex proceeds to have sex with a boy and it is revealed that his character is gay. Later Alex performs various tasks for his grandmother, being constantly bothered by his father. It is implied that he has a fascination with the sea (possibly that his grandfather was lost at sea). He and Liv continue to do as the die says and break and enter a house which turns out to be terribly messy. The two decide to mess with the owners head and clean the place. Liv comes on to Alex and he starts to tell her something, only to be interrupted by the owner of the house and the two flee the scene. Alex and Liv return to Alex's house where they find his father has arrived and is angrily packing Alex's grandmother's things. His father tells Alex to finish and leaves. Alex is upset, but his grandmother convinces him to dance with her and Alex, Liv and his grandmother dance. At the college it is announced that there will be a memorial service for Grace. Liv is disgusted that people who didn't know Grace are mourning her and is adamant that the friends not attend the service. Mini and Liv argue and Liv rushes off crying. She is followed by Alex, but when he tries to comfort her, she kisses him. Alex stops her and tells her he's gay. Liv becomes even more distraught and Alex tries to explain that he's never had friends before. Liv yells at him that they're not friends and Mini arrives to add that \"we don't need you.\" A hurt Alex runs home and discovers that his grandmother has committed suicide by taking sleeping pills. Liv, Mini, and Franky end up attending Grace's memorial service, but are disgusted by the shallow and over-the-top display and end up smashing things up and screaming at the other students. Liv then runs out of the college crying. She receives a call from Alex, who apologizes and asks to make it up to her. He then takes the whole group out on a sailboat for a \"party.\" While on the boat, he encourages Liv to talk to Mini, which she attempts to do, but Mini once again pushes Liv away. Mini then discovers a coffin with Alex's dead grandmother inside. The gang question Alex about the body and he explains that she didn't want to go where others wanted her and pleads the others to help bury her at sea. Alex reads a letter from his grandfather to his grandmother and the boys slide the coffin into the ocean and the gang becomes very emotional, their feelings about Grace welling up. Franky leaves a message on Matty's phone telling him to not to come back. Alex and Liv share another kiss, but it is platonic and they agree to be friends. They then roll his die and it lands on six, \"run away.\" Laughing, Alex and Liv jump off the boat.

Liv, Mini, and Franky end up attending Grace's memorial service, but are disgusted by the shallow and over-the-top display and end up smashing things up and screaming at the other students. Liv then runs out of the college crying. She receives a call from Alex, who apologizes and asks to make it up to her. He then takes the whole group out on a sailboat for a \"party.\" While on the boat, he encourages Liv to talk to Mini, which she attempts to do, but Mini once again pushes Liv away. Mini then discovers a coffin with Alex's dead grandmother inside. The gang question Alex about the body and he explains that she didn't want to go where others wanted her and pleads the others to help bury her at sea. Alex reads a letter from his grandfather to his grandmother and the boys slide the coffin into the ocean and the gang becomes very emotional, their feelings about Grace welling up. Franky leaves a message on Matty's phone telling him to not to come back. Alex and Liv share another kiss, but it is platonic and they agree to be friends. They then roll his die and it lands on six, \"run away.\" Laughing, Alex and Liv jump off the boat. The episode ends with the two of them swimming together and the die sinking to the bottom of the ocean. Note: First appearance of Alex. Rich, Matty and Grace are absent from this episode."

Notable for its simple but effective colour scheme of deep blues combined with silvery white and off-white tints of glass. The window was made under Whall\u2019s direction by James Powell & Sons. It is recorded that the armour worn by the sleeping soldier below the figure of Christ was designed and made up in cardboard by Whall, this to be worn by the model who posed for the figure. William Barnes was the Rector of Somerton from 1875 to 1923. The window was installed in the church on 29 September 1893."

        "Whall designed the window in this church dedicated to George Nelson Hector (1830\u20131918) a long time resident of St Raphael. The theme is that Good will come out of Evil and that Eternal Justice will triumph over Wrong and Violence. In one light we see St George, the Champion of England, standing on the Vanquished Dragon. In the background we see cities of France in flames and below Christ stilling the troubled waters. In the other is St Michael, with the Heavenly Scales, weighing and assessing the righteousness of the cause. Here in the background the flames of Destruction give place to the \u201cfiery tongues\u201d of the Spirit of God and below the Spirit of God moves upon the face of the waters, bringing Order out of Chaos. In the panel of the \u201cSpirit moving on the face of the waters\u201d the figures below the Dove are the four Winds. Reading from left to right they are the North Wind shown in a drift of snowflakes, the South Wind in a glow of sunshine, the East Wind in a gloomy cloud and the West Wind in the green and gold of spring time. The window was dedicated in March 1921. This church, in a suburb of Saint Raphael, was designed in 1900 by L\u00e9on Sergent. At the time it served a community of rich, British, winter residents. However when this clientele no longer worshiped regularly in Valescure, it was ceded to the Catholic church (in 1958). It is today L\u2019\u00c9glise de Tous les Saints, open every Sunday. Harry Stuart Goodhart Rendel, an architect and one time President of the R.I.B.A inherited the church in 1913 on the death of his grand father, Lord Rendel of Hatchlands. When the church was refurbished in the late 1920s, Colin Gill was commissioned to paint the frescoes in the chancel."

        "Even as Phil and Keely decide to become a couple, Phil gets the grim realization that the time machine is fixed. It also revealed that Lloyd was intentionally not repairing the time machine because the whole family is so happy living in this century. Upset that Phil's leaving just as they've admitted they love each other, Keely decides not to be there when the Diffys leave. But she changes her mind and rushes to the time machine... too late. Phil begs his father to go back, so he can truly say goodbye to Keely. Keely is reading the school news when Phil comes back to say goodbye. Phil exclaims \"I didn't wanna leave without saying goodbye for real\", and gives her a big passionate kiss on the lips in front of the entire school. Keely tells Phil to wait for her and Phil agrees and she gives him one more kiss. Phil leaves and goes back to the time machine, only to realize that they have left their pet caveman Curtis in the present, and start to go back. In the final scene of the series, we see Curtis getting food from the fridge. Curtis notices he's alone and panics.",
