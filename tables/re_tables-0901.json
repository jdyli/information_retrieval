        "Bella is visited by young Harry, whose mother Connie is dead in bed, probably as the result of poverty and hunger. Bill, Jack, Tom and Matt attend a Gallowshield Labour Party and Worker's Council meeting. They are petitioning the Board of Guardians for an increase in the Poor Law rates, and for greater social equality. Jack admits that politics isn't really his game. Bill invites Jack back for a meal. Returning home, Bill discovers that Bella has taken Harry, now an orphan, under her wing. Bella takes Harry to the fairground (\"the hoppins\"), and buys the urchin a new ten shilling coat. Father Keenly visits, suggesting that it might be best if Harry is deported to a facility in Melbourne, where he'd be able to continue his Catholic upbringing.

        "The miners have been on strike for a month, over a pay claim. Tom, now supporting a wife and son, borrows some money from Jack, who, despite being out of work for two months, doesn't seem to be short of a few bob. Jessie and Jack discuss having a baby, but Jessie says that her entire family is relying on her income. Jack claims that he's got money put by, and is supplementing this with \"odd jobs\". Mary is sick: she has tuberculosis, but won't acknowledge it, claiming it's just a cold. Jack, Matt and a couple of other men meet at the pub. Matt is concerned by a remark the barmaid has made, about them being \"flush\". They agree that they should change their meeting place. They conspiratorially discuss their next job, but Jack warns that the conditions aren't right. Matt and Jack return to Matt's home, where Matt's sister Dolly Mather has prepared a steak and kidney pie. Dolly, whose husband was killed in Ypres, flirts with Jack, before retiring to bed. Jack and Matt drink on, into the night. Later, Dolly brings Jack another blanket, and they share another cigarette. They kiss. They are overheard by Tom, who has followed Jack and Matt from the pub. Billy and Jack discuss Mary's condition. Jack invites Billy out for \"a hike\", in Morpeth. Tom has left Jack a veiled message, about finding Bert Mather's widow. Tom confronts Jack, who tells Tom that he can't help him. Tom threatens to reveal Jack's liaison with Dolly: \"You were doing alright, helping her...\" Tom wants to be included in whatever scam it is that Jack is running. Jack and Billy roam the countryside, armed with Captain Manners' binoculars and some mutton sandwiches. Billy tells Jack that Mary is dying, and rages against the inequality of wealth that's put her in that condition. Billy tells Jack that he wants him to fight for people like Mary \"because you're a leader\". A local policeman warns them to keep moving: \"we don't want tramps\". Billy affects \"a posh voice\", shows the him Captain Manners' binoculars, and the policeman apologises Jack visits Dolly again, and they make love. Jack, Matt, Charlie and Paddy [Boyle] discuss their next \"trench raid\": they are rustling sheep. Jack tells them that Tom will be joining them. Jessie says she's willing to have a child with Jack. Jack invites Tom to a \"fishing\" expedition. At dead of night, the gang begin catching and killing sheep. They prepare to leave, but Tom has forgotten one of the buckets (for the blood). He goes back to collect it, but is confronted by a patrolling policeman (the same policeman who had approached Billy and Jack). Tom struggles with the policeman, before Jack clubs him with a pick handle. Jack takes the injured Tom back to be treated by Billy. Jack admits to Jessie that they've been stealing sheep, so he couldn't take Tom to a hospital. Jack is expecting a sharp rebuke, but Jessie approves of his Robin Hood-style plan. Tom is twenty-four years old; Mary is twenty-two. Matt's sister, Dolly, is being courted by a bank clerk. Dolly's husband, Bert, was killed in Ypres, four years earlier, after they had only been married for three months. The sign on the side of the van used by the sheep rustlers says \"Trailer Specialists... Trading Estate Peterhead\". Jessie refers to Jack as her \"husband\". The episode title is explained by Jack, who says that they dumped the guts of the sheep and their hides into the North Sea: \"If the fish round here could knit, they'd all wear woolly jumpers!\"",

The episode title is explained by Jack, who says that they dumped the guts of the sheep and their hides into the North Sea: \"If the fish round here could knit, they'd all wear woolly jumpers!\"",
        "The miners have been on strike for a month, over a pay claim. Tom, now supporting a wife and son, borrows some money from Jack, who, despite being out of work for two months, doesn't seem to be short of a few bob. Jessie and Jack discuss having a baby, but Jessie says that her entire family is relying on her income. Jack claims that he's got money put by, and is supplementing this with \"odd jobs\". Mary is sick: she has tuberculosis, but won't acknowledge it, claiming it's just a cold. Jack, Matt and a couple of other men meet at the pub. Matt is concerned by a remark the barmaid has made, about them being \"flush\". They agree that they should change their meeting place. They conspiratorially discuss their next job, but Jack warns that the conditions aren't right. Matt and Jack return to Matt's home, where Matt's sister Dolly Mather has prepared a steak and kidney pie. Dolly, whose husband was killed in Ypres, flirts with Jack, before retiring to bed. Jack and Matt drink on, into the night. Later, Dolly brings Jack another blanket, and they share another cigarette. They kiss. They are overheard by Tom, who has followed Jack and Matt from the pub. Billy and Jack discuss Mary's condition. Jack invites Billy out for \"a hike\", in Morpeth. Tom has left Jack a veiled message, about finding Bert Mather's widow. Tom confronts Jack, who tells Tom that he can't help him. Tom threatens to reveal Jack's liaison with Dolly: \"You were doing alright, helping her...\" Tom wants to be included in whatever scam it is that Jack is running. Jack and Billy roam the countryside, armed with Captain Manners' binoculars and some mutton sandwiches. Billy tells Jack that Mary is dying, and rages against the inequality of wealth that's put her in that condition. Billy tells Jack that he wants him to fight for people like Mary \"because you're a leader\". A local policeman warns them to keep moving: \"we don't want tramps\". Billy affects \"a posh voice\", shows the him Captain Manners' binoculars, and the policeman apologises Jack visits Dolly again, and they make love. Jack, Matt, Charlie and Paddy [Boyle] discuss their next \"trench raid\": they are rustling sheep. Jack tells them that Tom will be joining them. Jessie says she's willing to have a child with Jack. Jack invites Tom to a \"fishing\" expedition. At dead of night, the gang begin catching and killing sheep. They prepare to leave, but Tom has forgotten one of the buckets (for the blood). He goes back to collect it, but is confronted by a patrolling policeman (the same policeman who had approached Billy and Jack). Tom struggles with the policeman, before Jack clubs him with a pick handle. Jack takes the injured Tom back to be treated by Billy. Jack admits to Jessie that they've been stealing sheep, so he couldn't take Tom to a hospital. Jack is expecting a sharp rebuke, but Jessie approves of his Robin Hood-style plan. Tom is twenty-four years old; Mary is twenty-two. Matt's sister, Dolly, is being courted by a bank clerk.

Billy tells Jessie that he's leaving university, fed up with being patronised. Bill visits an old colleague, pigeon fancier Sep Walker, hoping to find, and re-open, a coal seam that was closed fifty years earlier, the waterlogged \"Sammy\" pit. Billy is caught trying to break into a coal yard by a former schoolmate, Police Constable Robson. After a brief lecture on politics from Billy, Robson lets him go: he's under instructions to treat people stealing coal as if they were schoolboys stealing apples. Jack brings the Seatons half a hundredweight of \"best roundies\". Bill arrives with some logs, but says they're not for burning. Bill refuses Jack's gift, telling him that black market coal is no better than coal mined by blacklegs. Bill tells Bella to roll up the carpet in the front room, telling her that there may be coal under the floorboards. Jessie tells Jack and Bill that Billy is quitting university. Someone has stolen leeks from Tom's allotment. Tom investigates, and is told that Arty Stephenson may know something about it. Arty tells Tom that he chased off two children. Following Arty's lead, Tom and Billy find leak leaves in a dustbin, but tempers cool when they discover the culprits: two emaciated children. Their father was killed whilst off-duty, so their mother, Elsie Carter, doesn't receive a widow's pension. Tom tells Elsie that she's welcome to his leeks. To everyone's surprise, Bill doesn't seem to mind that Billy is quitting university. Bill and Tom dig for coal, but the hole soon starts to fill with water. Bill refuses Billy's offer of help, telling him he's \"bloody useless\". Bill continues to belittle Billy, hoping to shame him into going back to university.

Police Constable Robson is earning \u00a33 10s a week. The Seatons rent their home from Lord Lampton. Billy tells Tom and Bill that troops are preparing to quell civil unrest. Several references are made to the Bowes-Lyon family, and to the romance blossoming between Elisabeth Bowes-Lyons and Prince George, the Duke of York.",

Their father was killed whilst off-duty, so their mother, Elsie Carter, doesn't receive a widow's pension. Tom tells Elsie that she's welcome to his leeks. To everyone's surprise, Bill doesn't seem to mind that Billy is quitting university. Bill and Tom dig for coal, but the hole soon starts to fill with water. Bill refuses Billy's offer of help, telling him he's \"bloody useless\". Bill continues to belittle Billy, hoping to shame him into going back to university. After pumping out the water, Billy finds coal. Jack arrives, bearing poached rabbits and pheasant. This episode takes place a week after Swords and Pick Handles. Police Constable Robson is earning \u00a33 10s a week. The Seatons rent their home from Lord Lampton. Billy tells Tom and Bill that troops are preparing to quell civil unrest.

Billy tells Jessie that he's leaving university, fed up with being patronised.

Billy is caught trying to break into a coal yard by a former schoolmate, Police Constable Robson.

Bill is due home from the hospital, but doesn't know of her plan. Despite Jessie's best efforts a talented fourteen-year-old pupils, Ronnie Fairburn, is leaving the school to start work down the pit. Jessie and Mr Ashton visit Ronnie's mother, a widow. Jessie tells her that she's trying to get him a job as an apprentice draftsman. Her eldest son had left for America. Ronnie is looking forward to doing \"grown-up\" work. Jessie tells Ronnie to call on Tom at 3.30am the next morning, and he'll walk Ronnie through his first day. Jack and Dolly have made arrangements for her wedding, at the registry office, the next morning. Bella asks Jack to put some shelves up for her. Jack is currently \"on the dole\". Bella offers Jack five pounds, \"two week's wages\". Jack tells her that the shelves will be \"as solid as the Moritania\". Bella shows Jack how to get rid of fleas (using a candle and a plate of water). Jack slyly suggests that for another five pound, he and Dolly could emigrate to Australia, to help spare Jessie's disappointment. Bill returns home, wheelchair-bound. He's furious with Bella, who threatens \"It's either the shop, or I walk through that door and don't come back\". Bill has to admit that they need a steady income. Mr Ashton apologises to Jessie, for proposing to her. Jessie invites him to ask his question again. Tom negotiates with the pit deputy for a decent job for Ronnie, but has to settle for carrying water. Tom is concerned that he won't be able to keep a close eye on Ronnie, who'll be working twenty yards away. Tom tells Ronnie to watch out for the \"chummins\" \u2013 empty coal carts that speed by on the tracks, telling him that before they pass, there's a warning rap on the pipes. Ronnie dodges the chummins, but is startled by a rat, falls onto the line, and is killed. Tom is shattered, and vows not to return to the pit. Matt and Dolly nervously wait for Jack at the registrar's office. Jack arrives at the last minute, bearing a bouquet. Later Jack tells Matt and Dolly that he was delayed by a broken-down tram, and that had to hitch a ride with a passing rag and bone man.

        "Manners visits the recently married Jack and Dolly. Dolly is heavily pregnant, but Jack looks leaner than Manners remembers. Manners offers Jack whisky and smoked salmon sandwiches, and a job: \u00a320 for a week's work. He wants to buy a house from Lord Calderbeck, and wants Jack to act as a front-man. Bill refuses to serve Dolly, who is feeling ill, and cannot afford to see a doctor. Bella, who had cravings for strawberry jam when she was pregnant, is more sympathetic. Jack tells Manners the good news, and asks her to help him practicing being \"la di da\". Tom is prospering, with a tailor-made suit, and shoes to match (which he tells his parents he bought at a jumble sale, to avoid embarrassing them). Bella catches him with more than seven pounds: \"I suppose you're going to tell me you got that at a jumble sale 'n all?\" Jack and Manners visit the Calderbeck mansion. Believing himself to be alone in the greenhouse, Jack gives a Tarzan-like cry... and turns around to discover...Jane. He also meets Lord Calderbeck's nephew and heir, Freddy. Freddy confides to Jane that he's going to ask Jack for \u00a370,000 for the house. (Manners wants to pay no more than \u00a350,000). Manners tells Jack that Jane was recently widowed. Jack is posing as a working-class chap who's made a fortune from making automobile spares. After dinner, Jack and Jane escape the pack, to Freddy's irritation. Jane flirts with Jack, so Jack kisses her. Jane later tells Jack that they'll get on famously, if he can be discreet. Freddy gives jack a polite warning, telling him that he and Jane are \"more or less engaged\". They encounter Billy, herding cows, but Jack bluffs his way through, pretending that Billy used to work for him: \"I used to have some agricultural interests... sheep, you know...\" Jack meets Billy in the pub. Billy gives Jack a few tips that will help him establish how much Calderbeck's house is worth, and to the family's financial standing. Jack delights in shocking his hosts over dinner, with tales of his impoverished upbringing. Later that night Jack finds Jane in his bed, and they spend the night together. Jack learns that Lord Calderbeck resents Freddy, because the war claimed the lives of his three sons. Jack takes Jane to the local pub, signalling Tom to ignore them. Jack meets with Rogers, a man recently dismissed from Calderbeck's employ, who is bearing a grudge, leaving Jane at the bar. Jack meets with Manners, to tell him what he's learnt: that Calderbeck is willing to sell, to fund his retirement in the south of France, but feels he has to provide for Freddy. However, Jack has manoeuvred Jane into marrying Freddy, who is grateful to Jack. Jack renegotiates his deal with Manners, earning himself \u00a3150 for sealing the sale for \u00a335,000. Jack receives an urgent telegram. Dolly has had a miscarriage, and will not be able to have children. Manners has arranged for her care in a private ward. Jessie and Arthur were married in the week before this episode takes place: married in St Oswald's (sic?) \"honeymoon in Scarborough, reception at the Station Hotel\". Although they married off-screen, there's a scene in this episode where the Seatons receive the wedding photos, showing the cast in suitable costume (left). Tom pays five bob a month rent to his parents. Jack's sly reference to his \"agricultural interests\" is a nod to his sheep-rustling days (see episode 3: Fish In Woolly Jumpers).",

Jack tells Manners the good news, and asks her to help him practicing being \"la di da\". Tom is prospering, with a tailor-made suit, and shoes to match (which he tells his parents he bought at a jumble sale, to avoid embarrassing them). Bella catches him with more than seven pounds: \"I suppose you're going to tell me you got that at a jumble sale 'n all?\" Jack and Manners visit the Calderbeck mansion. Believing himself to be alone in the greenhouse, Jack gives a Tarzan-like cry... and turns around to discover...Jane. He also meets Lord Calderbeck's nephew and heir, Freddy. Freddy confides to Jane that he's going to ask Jack for \u00a370,000 for the house. (Manners wants to pay no more than \u00a350,000). Manners tells Jack that Jane was recently widowed. Jack is posing as a working-class chap who's made a fortune from making automobile spares. After dinner, Jack and Jane escape the pack, to Freddy's irritation. Jane flirts with Jack, so Jack kisses her. Jane later tells Jack that they'll get on famously, if he can be discreet. Freddy gives jack a polite warning, telling him that he and Jane are \"more or less engaged\". They encounter Billy, herding cows, but Jack bluffs his way through, pretending that Billy used to work for him: \"I used to have some agricultural interests... sheep, you know...\" Jack meets Billy in the pub. Billy gives Jack a few tips that will help him establish how much Calderbeck's house is worth, and to the family's financial standing. Jack delights in shocking his hosts over dinner, with tales of his impoverished upbringing. Later that night Jack finds Jane in his bed, and they spend the night together. Jack learns that Lord Calderbeck resents Freddy, because the war claimed the lives of his three sons. Jack takes Jane to the local pub, signalling Tom to ignore them. Jack meets with Rogers, a man recently dismissed from Calderbeck's employ, who is bearing a grudge, leaving Jane at the bar. Jack meets with Manners, to tell him what he's learnt: that Calderbeck is willing to sell, to fund his retirement in the south of France, but feels he has to provide for Freddy. However, Jack has manoeuvred Jane into marrying Freddy, who is grateful to Jack. Jack renegotiates his deal with Manners, earning himself \u00a3150 for sealing the sale for \u00a335,000. Jack receives an urgent telegram. Dolly has had a miscarriage, and will not be able to have children. Manners has arranged for her care in a private ward. Jessie and Arthur were married in the week before this episode takes place: married in St Oswald's (sic?) \"honeymoon in Scarborough, reception at the Station Hotel\". Although they married off-screen, there's a scene in this episode where the Seatons receive the wedding photos, showing the cast in suitable costume (left).

Presumably this episode takes place sometime after the previous episode, since Billy has a new job."

        "Tom and a group of other men are on moorland, illegally gambling on a game of Pitch and Toss. Handfuls of notes change hands. Tom leaves the men with his winnings (about sixty pounds) but his good fortune isn't appreciated by two sore losers, Dodger Green and Dickie Edgar. Matt and Jack have been at a memorial gathering for Harry Armstrong, where they've raised less than three pounds for the widow and children of a man killed in a pit accident six months earlier. A former \"outside man\", Mr Gibson, who used to work with Harry, makes a handsome contribution. Jessie visits Tom's home, where Daisy Meadows is house-sitting. Jessie then visits Lizzie Armstrong, and her son, Robert, who is excelling at school, and may be eligible for a scholarship. Matt and Jack are there, which makes for an uncomfortable atmosphere. Matt agrees to baby-sit for Lizzie, so that she can attend the annual Labour Party meeting, where she'll second Jessie's nomination for the Executive. Jack senses romance blossoming between Matt and Lizzie. Tom has been forced into hiding, in the stables. Billy finds Tom, who is planning on escaping to London. Dolly resents Jack's support for Jessie's political aspirations. They argue, and Jack storms out. Later Jack meets Matt in the pub, and is warned that tongues are wagging. Matt doubts that Jack is motivated by politics. Jessie is elected to the Executive. Arthur doesn't approve. Jack employs Robert and another boy to keep an eye on Tom's hiding place, from a nearby pigeon coup. Jack and Matt return from a day at the pit, to find themselves locked out by Dolly. Jack bursts his way back in, warning her never to do it again. Lizzie expresses her concerns about her developing relationship with Matt, who proposes marriage. She tells Matt that there's no room in her life for new man. Jack has arranged a safe route to the docks for Tom. Green and Edgar catch up with Tom, but they have a surprise in store: a \"tin panning\", which means they're hounded home by the womenfolk, bashing pots and pans. Jack returns home to find Dolly apologetic and a hearty meal on the table. Lizzie arrives with a letter from Mr Gibson: she's been offered a cleaning job paying a very respectable \"fifteen bob a week...half a man's wages\". Irish actor Shay Gorman (who plays Mr Gibson) appeared in several key drama series during the 1960s and 1970s, including Danger Man (The Sanctuary), The Saint (Little Girl Lost), Softly Softly (No Life For A Woman), and The Sweeney (Taste of Fear). He's also appeared in Minder (Why Pay Tax) and Boys from the Blackstuff (1982, as Malloy). Horror fans may recognise him from the 1966 film Island of Terror, or his voice from his uncredited narration on Jacques Tourneur's 1957 classic Night of the Demon (aka Curse of the Demon). More recently he featured as Father Jim Sutton in the 1995 Father Ted episode Grant Unto Him Eternal Rest. Actress Val McLane played Dennis' sister Norma Patterson in the second season of Auf Wiedersehen, Pet, but is, in fact, the sister of Jimmy \"Oz\" Nail. She's appeared in a couple of Catherine Cookson Tyne Tees TV mini-series (The Rag Nymph and The Moth in 1997, playing Aggie Winkovski, and in 1991's The Black Velvet Gown, as Annie Griston). She was also in LWT's 1997 adaptation of Jane Eyre (which starred Samantha Morton and Ciar\u00e1n Hinds), and featured in the landmark 1996 BBC drama series Our Friends in the North in 1996, as Rita Cox.",

        "A strike is brewing at Whitely's Shipyard. Union Branch Chairman Les Mallow offers Jack the position of District Secretary. Discovering that Jack's not interested, Les asks if Jack will run as his deputy, a post that pays \u00a35 a week. Stolen goods have been found in Tom's possession: the police had been tipped off (\"hunger breeds envy, Jessie, and envy breeds anonymous letters\"). Tom is making his situation more difficult by refusing to reveal where other items lost in the same robberies are. He claims he sold the rest to a man in a pub. Dolly visits a God-fearing widower, Mrs Downey, and her two children, who are living off a handout of twenty shillings a week. She's in danger of being evicted. Dolly brings Downey's situation to the attention of Les Mallow. The miners are put on notice: short-time for two weeks, then the sack. Mallow calls a strike meeting, to discuss taking strike action. Jessie visits Jack, to let him know about Tom's predicament. At the branch committee meeting, Jack tables a motion preventing industrial action, seconded by Matt. As Chairman, Les's hands are tied to intervene. The workers vote against striking. Jack brings Mrs Downey's plight to the meeting's attention. Jack's advocacy wins him the support of the rank and file members. It may count for nothing: Downey's landlord has locked her out. Jack seizes a hammer, and sets off to reclaim her furniture. As Jack prepares to break into Downey's home he discovers that she wrote the letter to the police, informing on Tom. After clearing the flat, Jack waits for the landlord, and the police (to give Matt time to get away with the reclaimed furniture). Jack is arrested, and put in a cell with Tom. The next day Tom is brought before the court, and, despite the best efforts of his solicitor, Martin Hopkins, is sentenced to three months' imprisonment. Jack is next to be tried, and the magistrate simply repeats, word-for-word, his summary of Tom's trial. Jack refuses to accept the validity of the court: \"It's all very well to say we're equal under the law, but when you're starving you're only equal to the next poor bugger who's starving\". Jack is sentenced to one month in prison: a martyr. Jessie is impressed: \"Bastard! You wonderful, cunning bastard!\" Jack and Tom are taken to H.M. Prison Durham. Mallow visits Dolly with an offer of financial assistance from the Union, but Matt senses that Mallow is looking to take political advantage of the situation, and turns down the offer. Matt tells Dolly that Jack helped Downey to manoeuvre himself into a position where he can be elected as District Secretary. After serving his sentence, Jack is released from prison. Matt has arranged for a welcoming procession, including a colliery band! Jack is paraded through the streets as a \"The People's Friend\", hammer in hand. Jessie tells Jack she doesn't entirely approve of his new-found power, or the way he got it, hoping that he won't forget the people he's going to represent. \"Don't you worry, bonnie lass, they'll get their share... eventually\". Jack makes yet more references to the sheep-stealing raids in Fish In Woolly Jumpers. There's also a veiled reference to Tom strike-breaking in episode 4, Swords and Pick Handles. Dolly says that Jack still has some of the money given to him by Sir Horatio in King For A Day. Mrs Downey's husband Joe died of consumption. He was a union member for seventeen years. The title is derived from Jessie's appraisal of Jack's survival instincts: \"When the ship sinks, he'll be the only rat with a lifebelt\". Jack is tried using his real name, John (I believe this is the first time in the series that this is stated). The previous District secretary was named Norman Taylor. Les Mallow was a pacifist during the war, and went to prison for it.",

        "A strike is brewing at Whitely's Shipyard. Union Branch Chairman Les Mallow offers Jack the position of District Secretary. Discovering that Jack's not interested, Les asks if Jack will run as his deputy, a post that pays \u00a35 a week. Stolen goods have been found in Tom's possession: the police had been tipped off (\"hunger breeds envy, Jessie, and envy breeds anonymous letters\"). Tom is making his situation more difficult by refusing to reveal where other items lost in the same robberies are. He claims he sold the rest to a man in a pub. Dolly visits a God-fearing widower, Mrs Downey, and her two children, who are living off a handout of twenty shillings a week. She's in danger of being evicted. Dolly brings Downey's situation to the attention of Les Mallow. The miners are put on notice: short-time for two weeks, then the sack. Mallow calls a strike meeting, to discuss taking strike action. Jessie visits Jack, to let him know about Tom's predicament. At the branch committee meeting, Jack tables a motion preventing industrial action, seconded by Matt. As Chairman, Les's hands are tied to intervene. The workers vote against striking. Jack brings Mrs Downey's plight to the meeting's attention. Jack's advocacy wins him the support of the rank and file members. It may count for nothing: Downey's landlord has locked her out. Jack seizes a hammer, and sets off to reclaim her furniture. As Jack prepares to break into Downey's home he discovers that she wrote the letter to the police, informing on Tom. After clearing the flat, Jack waits for the landlord, and the police (to give Matt time to get away with the reclaimed furniture). Jack is arrested, and put in a cell with Tom. The next day Tom is brought before the court, and, despite the best efforts of his solicitor, Martin Hopkins, is sentenced to three months' imprisonment. Jack is next to be tried, and the magistrate simply repeats, word-for-word, his summary of Tom's trial. Jack refuses to accept the validity of the court: \"It's all very well to say we're equal under the law, but when you're starving you're only equal to the next poor bugger who's starving\". Jack is sentenced to one month in prison: a martyr. Jessie is impressed: \"Bastard! You wonderful, cunning bastard!\" Jack and Tom are taken to H.M. Prison Durham. Mallow visits Dolly with an offer of financial assistance from the Union, but Matt senses that Mallow is looking to take political advantage of the situation, and turns down the offer. Matt tells Dolly that Jack helped Downey to manoeuvre himself into a position where he can be elected as District Secretary. After serving his sentence, Jack is released from prison. Matt has arranged for a welcoming procession, including a colliery band! Jack is paraded through the streets as a \"The People's Friend\", hammer in hand. Jessie tells Jack she doesn't entirely approve of his new-found power, or the way he got it, hoping that he won't forget the people he's going to represent. \"Don't you worry, bonnie lass, they'll get their share... eventually\".
