        "On the night of Mrs. McCluskey's 70th birthday party, the wives reflect on crucial events that have occurred over the last five years and led them to where they are today: Gabrielle had two \"miracle\" babies and asked Carlos to get a vasectomy because she decided not to have any more kids, but finds out Carlos did not have the vasectomy because he wants a son; Bree's alcoholism reared its ugly head again the night Orson left for prison but Katherine helped her to move past it. Orson asks her to tell Katherine about his wanting to become a partner but she refuses because she doesn't want to hurt Katherine's feelings. However, Orson tells Katherine who decides to accept him as a partner in time; Tom had a near-death experience that fueled a midlife crisis and his need to add a tinge of excitement and adventure to his life, which includes the pizzeria dream, but Lynette objects; Susan finalized her divorce with Mike and found herself in bed with her house painter, Jackson, and agreed to keep the relationship \"physical and casual\", but Jackson wanted more in the relationship; Susan refuses, leading to a break-up. Dave attempts to get rid of Mrs. McCluskey and her nosiness and tries to prove she is demented so that he can unleash the plans for his real agenda which are finally revealed.",

        "In the Machine World, the Engines Speedor, Bus-on, and Bearrv defeat Gaiark's three Pollution Ministers in a race, knocking the three last survivors of their kind into a wormhole leading to Earth. Six months later, deciding to make Earth their home by polluting it, Gaiark start attacking the human race with their Barbaric Machine Beast Shoukyaku Banki leading the Ugatz on the day of a wedding. However, Shouyaku Banki faces three carefree humans, S\u014dsuke, Renn and Saki, who knew of Gaiark as they change into the Go-ongers. The fight was witnessed by two men, Hant and Gunpei, the latter of whom questions the Go-ongers' sense of heroism after the battle, demanding to know where they got their power from. S\u014dsuke, Renn, and Saki leave on the Ginjiro-go without giving Gunpei any answers. At Gaiark's Hellgailles Place, Shoukyaku Banki begs for forgiveness from the Pollution Ministers as he reveals the Go-ongers may be tied to the Engines. He is upgraded with the perfected Bikkurium Energy and then sent back after the Go-ongers. Though Shoukyaku Banki had become much stronger than before, the Go-ongers defeat the Barbaric Machine Beast with their Go-on Gear. When Gaiark sends out their Barbaric Dohma armada to cover the unconscious Shouyaku Banki while the Bikkurium begins to manifest, the Go-ongers summon the benefactors of their power; the three Engines who have followed Gairark to Earth. After the Engines take out the Barbaric Dohmas, Shoukyaku Banki's Bikkurium finally takes effect and he undergoes Industrial Revolution. The Engines counter and combine to form Engine-Oh, who plugs Shoukyaku Banki's smoke stacks before scrapping him. After the fight, the Go-ongers meet Hant and Gunpei, who again wishes to speak to the Engines and demands to join their team. As Hant argues with Gunpei, S\u014dsuke, Renn, and Saki stealthily climb aboard the Ginjiro-go and speed away.",

        "Water Pollution Minister Kegalesia sends Pipe Banki to pollute Earth's waters. Bomper, the Go-onger's support robo, picks up on Pipe Banki's presence and sends the three Go-ongers to the nearby dam to battle Pipe Banki and the Ugatz. Surprisingly, Pipe Banki escapes before the battle's end, satisfied with how his powers have affected the water supply. During the fight, Gunpei sneaks aboard the Ginjiro-go, kidnaps Bomper, and steals the Engine Casts. Again, he demands information about the Go-ongers and threatens to disassemble the frightened robo. Hant appears and is awed by Bomper's ability to speak. After Bomper tells Gunpei and Hant why the Engines need human partners, the Go-ongers arrive. S\u014dsuke struggles with Gunpei to retrieve the Engine Casts, but Gunpei easily shoves him away. Once again, Gunpei questions the Go-ongers' maturity and battle-worthiness and refuses to return the Engine Casts. Suddenly, Bomper reports that an Industrial Revolutionized Pipe Banki has arrived to flood the city. Without their Engine Casts, the Go-ongers assemble the Highway Buster in a seemingly futile attempt to defeat Pipe Banki. As Gunpei watches them recklessly fight against the odds, Bomper reveals the origins of the three Go-ongers and why they were picked as the Engines' drivers. With a change of heart, Gunpei decides to return the Engine Casts, and Hant offers his help to do so. Seeing the same sense of justice he saw in S\u014dsuke, Renn, and Saki, Bomper gives Hant and Gunpei the ShiftChangers, allowing them to become Go-ongers. With their Engine Casts back, the primary Go-ongers are able to form Engine-Oh to battle Pipe Banki. During the fight, a bridge span is destroyed, which endangers an innocent woman and child trapped in their car. Engine-Oh is unable to land the deathblow on Pipe Banki until Go-on Green and Go-on Black rescue mother and son. With the addition of Hant and Gunpei, the Go-ongers are finally assembled to fight Gaiark.",

While S\u014dsuke and Gunpei attempt to get Gunpherd's Engine Cast back, Hant, Saki, and Renn find Birca as he splits into his Engine Soul and Engine Cast.

The grateful young man gives Gunpherd's Engine Cast to Go-on Black as a reward for saving him, and Go-on Green takes Birca's Engine Cast back from Kegalesia.

The grateful young man gives Gunpherd's Engine Cast to Go-on Black as a reward for saving him, and Go-on Green takes Birca's Engine Cast back from Kegalesia. Once again able to assume their full size, Birca and Gunpherd deal with the Barbaric Doumas before wounding Spray Banki for Engine-Oh to land the coup de gr\u00e2ce.

        "Gunpherd and Birca, the other two Engines sent to pursue Gaiark alongside Speedor, Bus-on, and Bearrv, finally arrive on Earth. Bomper detects their signatures as they reach Earth's atmosphere. The Go-ongers rush to the landing site as Kegalesia tries to intercept them. Gunpei finds the Engine Soul of Gunpherd, but not his Engine Cast. Gunpei and S\u014dsuke eventually discover that Gunpherd's Engine Cast is in the hands of a boy who thinks it is a toy. While S\u014dsuke and Gunpei attempt to get Gunpherd's Engine Cast back, Hant, Saki, and Renn find Birca as he splits into his Engine Soul and Engine Cast. Hant retrieves the Engine Soul, but the Engine Cast is captured by Spray Banki. Renn, Saki, and Hant attempt to reclaim Birca's Engine Cast when Kegalesia reveals herself. She fights Go-on Green as Go-on Red arrives and the primary Go-ongers use the Highway Buster on Spray Banki.

        "After S\u014dsuke attempts to apologize to Saki for unwittingly upsetting her, she is drawn to a beautiful melody played by a handsome flautist named Seiji Ogawa. Suddenly, Speaker Banki appears and turns Seiji's beautiful music into noise pollution. Saki rescues Seiji from the Savage Machine Beast's attack before she and S\u014dsuke fight him. The other Go-ongers arrive, all wearing earplugs, and damage the monster's speakers, forcing him to retreat. Seiji asks Saki out on a date, and when S\u014dsuke gets wind of it, he is concerned that she has fallen in love with the musician. He asks Gunpei to help him find out for certain, after the latter insinuates that he has excellent lip-reading skills. Gunpei agrees, but in reality, his lip-reading skills are sub-par, and only heighten S\u014dsuke's worries. A few days later, the upgraded Speaker Banki resumes his attack after secretly absorbing sounds from the city. Seiji calls Saki and asks her to meet him; he has something important to tell her. As word of Speaker Banki's rampage gets out, Saki moves to go into battle, but S\u014dsuke, believing that she intends to marry Seiji, tells her to follow her heart and not her teammates. The male Go-ongers, however, come up short against Speaker Banki. Saki arrives and saves her teammates; when she met with Seiji, he gave her some information that he was confident would give her an advantage in battle. Armed with the knowledge, the Go-ongers use the Highway Buster and the Junction Rifle to defeat Speaker Banki. Saki gently scolds both Gunpei and S\u014dsuke for their meddling before Speaker Banki Industrial Revolutionizes. The team forms Engine-Oh to battle him, but they are overpowered.

At Hellgailles Palace, thanks to the images Lens Banki took before he was destroyed by Engine-Oh and GunBir-Oh, the Pollution Ministers collaborate to create a special Savage Machine Beast that can duplicate the Engines' special attacks: Kagami Banki. Once the Industrial Revolutionized Kagami Banki goes on the attack, the Go-ongers form Engine-Oh and GunBir-Oh to fight it, but the Savage Machine Beast uses his \"Mirror Effect\" power to copy GunBir-Oh's attacks and defeat it before creating his own Go-on Sword to take out Engine-Oh.

Back at the Ginjiro-go, Renn reveals that he was aware that Gaiark would pull off such a stunt and that he has been creating a new formation that would combine all six Engines together into one to counter such a situation. Renn enlists Gunpei and Hant's help in finishing the modifications to Birca, Gunpherd, and Carrigator. Since Kagami Banki is taking a long time to be recharged with Bikkurium, the bored Pollution Ministers send a massive armada of Barbaric Dohma to attack the city. Renn gives S\u014dsuke Bus-on to help him, Speedor, Saki and Bearrv fight the Barbaric Dohmas as Renn and the others complete the modifications. After the Barbaric Dohmas are scrapped, Kagami Banki arrives with the Engines' five minutes, assuming his true \"Land/Sky/Sea Special\" form to overpower Engine-Oh. Once the other Engines finally arrive, they assemble to form Engine-Oh G6, who overpowers and scraps Kagami Banki. The Go-ongers congratulate Renn for the new formation, but he modestly refuses to take all the glory.

Each sees a golden chance to destroy his enemy from within, but Hatsuden Banki is waylaid by the other Go-ongers' earnest, yet bizarre, attempts to cure \"S\u014dsuke\" of his cold, and \"Hatsuden Banki\" is set to have his power amplified for Yogostein's \"Plan B.\" When \"Hatsuden Banki\" destroys the generator that has amplified his powers, \"S\u014dsuke,\" who has escaped from the Go-ongers, shows up and tries to convince Yogostein that he is really Hatsuden Banki. \"S\u014dsuke\" and \"Hatsuden Banki\" start battling each other, and just as Yogostein figures out the situation, the other four Go-ongers arrive.

Yogostein grabs \"S\u014dsuke\" and threatens to kill him if the Go-ongers do not defeat \"Hatsuden Banki.\" However, the Go-ongers see right through Yogostein's plan, thanks to Speedor, and attack \"S\u014dsuke\" instead, forcing Yogostein to retreat. \"S\u014dsuke\" turns into \"Go-on Red\" and fights the Go-ongers, but is knocked down by \"Hatsuden Banki.\" Speedor and his fellow Engines combine their powers to draw S\u014dsuke's soul from \"Hatsuden Banki\" into a Soul Chip, which the Go-ongers place in the Junction Rifle and fire at \"S\u014dsuke.\" Both souls are returned to their rightful bodies, but S\u014dsuke's cold remains in the body of Hatsuden Banki, which weakens the beast enough to be beaten by a Speedor-powered Super Highway Buster. Hatsuden Banki then Industrial Revolutionizes, but he is still hampered by S\u014dsuke's cold, which allows Engine-Oh G6 to scrap him easily. Later on, back on board Ginjiro-go, S\u014dsuke asks why the other Go-ongers did not realize the body switch sooner than they did. Gunpei's explanation soon devolves into an argument between him, Renn, Saki, and Hant about the cold cures each was administering to \"S\u014dsuke,\" and they ignore S\u014dsuke's pleas to get them to stand down."

        "A mysterious childish girl is attacked by Hikigane Banki until the Go-ongers show up to save her when the Savage Machine Beast has the girl in his clutches with the Ugatz covering him. But Go-on Blue grabs the girl from Hikigane Banki, forcing him to run him away, but ends up scratches Renn. After apologizing for accidentally mistaking his intentions, the girl apologizes and introduces herself as \"B\u016bkorin\". However, Gunpei's words scare B\u016bkorin away for claiming to be from the sky and that she did not give her real name. At Gaiark, the Pollution Ministers try to entertain a mysterious scary-looking yakuza named Gego who offers them many weapons in return for B\u016bkorin. But when he hears that Hikigane Banki failed, Dokk\u016bgo decides to settle this personally after making the Savage Machine Beast his lackey. After seeing B\u016bkorin and Renn together, with the later promising to help her with her troubles, the man reveals himself to be B\u016bkorin's father who wants her to follow in his footsteps rather than living out her dream of a building a theme park. While the other Go-ongers deal with Hikigane Banki, Renn is forced to deal with Gego for B\u016bkorin's sake by putting his own freedom on the line in a three-round match. After both are tied in the first two matches, Renn is forced into a swordsman's duel. In spite of losing, Renn refuses to surrender, sparking B\u016bkorin with his words as she stops the fight and frightens her dad to unconsciousness with her new attitude. Renn then joins the others in defeating Hikigane Banki with a Bus-On-powered Super Highway Buster. However, Hikigane Banki Industrial Revolutionizes, only to be scrapped by Engine-Oh G6. Later, B\u016bkorin thanks Renn as she intends to carry on her father's legacy while living her dream before she and Gego take their leave in a UFO, revealing themselves to be aliens with Renn wishing that he asked about B\u016bkorin's home planet.",

When S\u014dsuke and gang are unable to the fight the crisis, the Sut\u014d siblings arrive to back the Go-ongers up, revealing themselves as the partners of Toripter and Jetras: The Go-on Wings, who easily defeat the Ugatz without trouble and drive Happa Banki away. However, in spite of offering their friendship, the Go-ongers are ignored by the Go-on Wings as Toripter and Jetras arrive to pick their partners up. The Go-ongers take the rejection hard as the Sut\u014d siblings later arrive to tell the Go-ongers of Gaiark's eventual attack at Mt.

        "While Miu is out shopping, Hiroto is at a caf\u00e9 with a blonde woman when he is contacted by his mentor. Saki sees Hiroto trying to rebuff the woman and mistakenly assumes that they are in an embrace. Suddenly, Nokogiri Banki, now rebuilt as Chainsaw Banki, arrives to destroy the city. The dust cloud created by Chainsaw Banki's destruction renders the Go-ongers unable to locate him. The Go-on Wings arrive as the dust settles, and each of the Go-ongers reveal that they have seen Hiroto out with one of at least five different women. Miu is upset by the news as Chainsaw Banki escapes after gathering some information Hiramechimedes needs. Miu later discovers that each woman had been exhorting Hiroto to pursue various alternative careers, and Hiroto had rejected all their offers in order to be a hero. Feeling that she has ruined her brother's life and derailed his future, Miu rushes off to battle the Gaiark on her own. The next day, the Go-ongers find Chainsaw Banki making sawdust as part of Hiramechimedes' plan. An agitated Go-on Silver joins the Go-ongers as Chainsaw Banki cloaks himself in a cloud of sawdust. Go-on Silver is goaded by Chainsaw Banki into firing at him, which she does, igniting the sawdust just as Hiroto arrives. He reassures Miu that he fights as Go-on Gold not out of obligation to her, but because he truly wants to. The Sut\u014d siblings reconcile as their instructor, the giant Engine Jum-bowhale, arrives. After putting out the flames, Jum-bowhale deals with Hiramechimedes and the Barbaric Dohma SP swarm. The Go-on Wings battle Chainsaw Banki together and defeat him. Chainsaw Banki is Industrial Revolutionized as Hiramechimedes escapes. Jum-bowhale calls Hiroto and Miu to join him, and the siblings bring Toripter and Jetras to the battlefield to form Seiku-Oh with their instructor. Chainsaw Banki is outmatched by Seiku-Oh and is scrapped. Afterwards, Miu exuberantly promises to support Hiroto more, which unnerves him somewhat.",

Kegalesia and Kitaneidas manage to find Nigorl zo Arelunbra and revive him, much to the former's chagrin. Nigorl reveals his surprising love of beautiful things, including Kegalesia, as the Go-on Wings arrive. Nigorl summons his Beauty Ugatz to deal with them as he duels the Go-ongers for insulting him. When Go-on Silver intervenes, Nigorl talks a reluctant Kegalesia into teaming up to form the Water Pollution Fusion.

During the search, Hant loses his footing and his Shift Changer, and goes tumbling over the side of a hill. He is found by Osen, an old woman who lives on the mountain, who nurses him back to health. To repay Osen's kindness, Hant helps her move her \"treasures,\" which are nothing more than assorted piles of junk, and learns about Osen's beloved granddaughter. Meanwhile, the other Go-ongers encounter Dowsing Banki, who is also looking for the object. They discover that Hant is missing and, with the help of the Go-on Wings, go search for him. The Go-on teams soon find Hant at Osen's, and are shocked to find him wearing girls' clothing in an effort to resemble Osen's granddaughter. During the confusion, Kitaneidas and Dowsing Banki arrive and capture Osen, along with a small refrigerator, which is revealed to be the object that crashed on the mountain. The refrigerator turns out to be a super weapon that can instantly increase the volume of trash by hundreds of times. Dowsing Banki stays behind to occupy the Go-ongers as Kitaneidas absconds with Osen and the weapon. Go-on Green and the Go-on Wings fight their way past Dowsing Banki to pursue Kitaneidas, who reveals that Osen is actually a science sorceress from the Junk World and the creator of the weapon, which is responsible for the Junk World's current state. Since Osen is the only one who can operate the weapon, Kitaneidas had deceived Osen into thinking that the Human World had declared war on the Junk World in order to bring her to the Human World. As Engine-Oh Gunpherd battles Dowsing Banki and the Go-on Wings deal with Kitaneidas, Hant fights his way past a horde of Ugatz and begs Osen to not turn on the weapon.

Deciding to set up a trap with the Go-on Wings' aid, the Go-ongers disguise themselves to wait out Manhole Banki before he finally makes his move, with Gunpei abducted. After telling the Go-ongers, Kashiwagi admits that Gunpei is just like he was the day he left the police force after he first saw the Go-ongers. While this occurred, once learning the Gaiark's newest scheme to use the pen-spinners to power-up Kitaneidas' Destructive Sound Machine, Go-on Black frees the prisoners before fighting Manhole Banki, destroying the machine as the others arrive to defeat him with Super Highway Buster/Wing Booster combo.

        "After returning from his mourning solitude and soul searching, a raging Yogostein is convinced to rely on his very own power as he goes all out into pouring it into the creation of destructive Hammer Banki to extract his revenge on the Go-ongers. After a failed attempt to work on the newest weapon he and Jum-bowhale have been developing, Hiroto takes a break until Hammer Banki begins his attack. Finding the district in ruins, the Go-ongers encounter Yogostein as he has Hammer Banki attack them before the Go-on Wings arrive. However, Go-on Silver is gravely injured in the fight when she attempted to save her brother from Hammer Banki, with Go-on Gold forced to watch his sister being brutally wounded further until the Go-ongers intervene and Yogostein retreats to re-energize his monster while the other Pollution Ministers express concern for their comrade's state of mind. With Miu on life support, Hiroto vows as he trains himself with the male members following him to talk him to be at his sister's side while learning that the training is for something else that can destroy Hammer Banki. Once Miu regains consciousness, she and Jum-bowhale reveal the project Hiroto has been working on, the Go-Roader GT, though without a working Power Soul is prone to attack everything. As Renn decides to solve the Power Soul issue with Miu's aid, Hiroto arrives to face Yogostein and Hammer Banki, attempting to use the Go-Roader before it started to attack him. However, the other Go-ongers arrive to hold the Go-Roader off so Hiroto can deactivate it. Though Yogostein decides to retreat at the moment, Hammer Banki refuses to run off and enlarges to kill the Go-ongers and his master until Jetras and Bus-on arrive and the teams form Engine-Oh G9. Once formed, Renn gives Hiroto the completed T\u014dkon Soul to use on the Go-Roader, enabling it to enlarge and assume Action Mode to weaken Hammer Banki before it and Engine-Oh G9 scrap him. As Kegalesia and Kitaneidas comfort Yogostein as he realized the downside of his vengeance, the Go-on teams celebrate the Go-Roader's completion as Hiroto gives the new weapon to the Go-ongers after they prove themselves in a group jog.",

Speedor's energy is almost completely drained in the test and he becomes furious with S\u014dsuke for blindly rushing forth. Just then, Straw Banki attacks the city with his Bakuha Drink. The Go-on Wings battle him until he uses his Straw Scattershot missiles on the people. The Go-ongers arrive and help the Go-on Wings battle the Savage Machine Beast, but Go-on Red and Speedor are still arguing over the Go-Roader GT incident. Straw Banki is forced to retreat after he loses his Gai Aqua power-up drink.

The Gai Aqua causes S\u014dsuke and Renn to lose their sense of justice and, now referring to themselves as S\u014dnoji and K\u014dsaka, they start pandering the Go-ongers as a for-profit organization in an insurance scam, much to Saki, Hant, and Gunpei's horror.

Meanwhile, Bomper reminds the still-miffed Speedor of why he had chosen S\u014dsuke to be his partner. Speedor puts himself into the Go-Roader GT and engages the Action Mode to literally beat some sense into S\u014dnoji.

But just as it is about to win with the Go-Roader's help, the Golden Dragon whirls to life and emerges from the cave, revealed not to be the Horonderthal but a trio of train Engines as they ram into Engine-Oh G9 before driving off Drill Banki and then flies off with Rokuro and his children watching the Golden Dragon taking its leave. Though the family thanked them for making their dream come true, the Go-ongers decide to find the mysterious Engines."

When Renn spots the Change Souls inside the wound on Yogostein's body, Speedor throws himself at the Pollution Minister and pins him down long enough for the Go-on teams to climb inside and reclaim their Change Souls. The Go-on teams transform and assemble Engine-Oh G12, which quickly takes Yogostein down and undoes the rust attack he had unleashed on the city. Yogostein, further injured and back to normal size, is still determined to use the now-damaged Horonderthal upgrade key. He attempts to flee, but he is confronted by a revived and extremely angry S\u014dsuke. As his teammates watch anxiously, S\u014dsuke transforms into Go-on Red and engages Yogostein in a one-on-one duel. Go-on Red wins the duel and Yogostein is destroyed. Kegalesia and Kitaneidas mourn the loss of their comrade as the Go-on teams celebrate S\u014dsuke's recovery."

While Renn's back is turned, the Ancient Engine Souls jump aboard S\u014dsuke's RC truck and flee the Ginjiro-go. Kegalesia speaks at the Gaiarks' wake for Yogostein, only to be interrupted by a commotion caused by Kitaneidas, who had promised to avenge Yogostein, and had created a powerful Savage Machine Beast to do just that. The Go-ongers finally discover that the Ancient Engines are gone, and they split up, frantically searching the city for them. Renn's search leads him to the Sut\u014ds' villa, where he finds the Ancient Engines hiding out. Kishamoth, T-line, and K-line blame themselves for the events that led to S\u014dsuke's brush with death and had run away, feeling unworthy of being partners with the Go-ongers. Renn tries to assure the Ancient Engines that no one, especially S\u014dsuke, blames them for anything, and presents the weapon he created for them, which he calls the Kankanbar. Meanwhile, the other Go-ongers run afoul of Kitaneidas and Kegalesia riding in Engine Banki, a Barbaric Machine Machine based on Engine-Oh itself. The Ancient Engines are still not convinced that they can help, so Hiroto volunteers to talk to them as Renn and Miu leave with Bus-on and Jetras to aid Gun-Bir-Oh, Bearrv, and Speedor against Engine Banki. Unfortunately, Engine Banki is more than GunBir-Oh, Go-Roader, and Engine-Oh Jetras can handle, and he breaks the combinations. The Go-ongers remain undaunted, using everything at their disposal to battle Engine Banki. As everyone at the Sut\u014d villa watches the Go-ongers fight valiantly, Hiroto pours out his heart, telling the Ancient Engines that, in the same way that they had protected the dinosaurs, he and his friends will risk their lives to protect those they care about. The Ancient Engines finally understand and agree to fight side-by-side with the Go-on teams. Go-on Gold arrives at the battleground and uses the Kankanbar, powered by T-line and K-line, to shrink Engine Banki and force Kitaneidas and Kegalesia to abandon ship. Go-on Gold hands off the Kankanbar to Go-on Red, who links the new weapon with his Mantangun and uses the Kankan Mantangun, powered by all three Ancient Engines, to scrap the Savage Machine Beast. Afterwards, the gang admire the Kankanbar and are happy that the Ancient Engines have returned to the fold, but when Toripter announces that Hiroto's \"fiery persuasion\" was what brought the Ancient Engines around, the attention shifts; everyone begs to know what exactly the normally stoic and aloof Hiroto had said, as he tries to modestly shrug it off as no big deal.",

However, while everyone is drying off, Saki notices that S\u014dsuke and the other boys are petrified. Miu shows up shortly after, carrying an equally paralyzed Hiroto on her back.

After his Engine is forced to leave his Engine Cast, Hiroto looks after the egg until it hatches, revealing a tadpole-like creature that imprints on Hiroto. He soon learns that he must take care of the creature and keep it happy, as it can produce high-frequency crying that can destroy the city if it is not happy. But Hiroto takes the baby to the Ginjiro-go and there Jum-bowhale reveals to the Go-ongers that baby is a Wameikle from the Braneworld known as Stormy World. Wondering how it got to their dimension, Renn remembers he and Sosuke saw some Ugatz gathering tadpoles and realizes the Gaiark are behind it as an annoyed Miu arrives to demand to know Hiroto's whereabouts. But when the Go-ongers and Miu pound on the Ginjiro-go to talk to him, Wameikle freaks out and hops off with Hiroto in pursuit as the tadpole is captured by the Ugatz, with Hiroto unable to save the baby as Go-on Gold scares it. Hiroto feels bad about not saving Wameikle, with he others offering to fight in his place to save the baby. Things get worse when the Ugatz use their power to forcibly grow Wameikle into its adult form and placed it in a fit of rage to attack the Go-ongers and use its high-frequency screams to break the dimensional barriers so the Stormy World's tornadoes can devastate the Human World. While GunBir-Oh and Kyorestu-Oh deal with the endless tornado onslaught, a furious Hiroto takes down the Ugatz single-handedly before seeing he has no choice but to fight Wameikle. With the new weapon Renn developed, Hiroto manages to calm Wameikle down with its favorite vegie juice as the Engine Combinations restore the Dimensional Barrier. Hiroto then says goodbye to his \"child\" as Wameikle returns to the Stormy World, with the Go-ongers provoking Hiroto into chasing them after they call him the team's \"father figure\".",

        "At Hellgailles Palace, Kitaneidas and Kegalesia receive a surprise visit by one of the Gaiark's strongest ministers, Cleaning Minister Kireizky who had just finished cleaning the Braneworld of Prism World after the Sound and Magic Worlds before coming to the Human World to aid the Ministers in cleaning it of the Go-ongers. After getting the Ginjiro-go ready for Christmas, the Go-ongers respond to the Gaiark sighting and are ambushed by Kireizky's sniping, revealing himself to be the one who sniped them during Engine-Oh G9's fight against Bin Banki before sending Go-on Red flying after the Go-onger rushes at him. As the Go-on Wings' cover the others' escape and are knocked off themselves, S\u014dsuke encounters a wounded man in a Santa Claus outfit. After the man proves himself to be the real Santa Claus by showing S\u014dsuke the Christmas present from his childhood that inspired him to follow his dream to be a racer, Speedor reveals Santa to be from another Braneworld, Christmas World. After being contacted by Bomper while offering to help Santa, S\u014dsuke takes him to the Ginjiro-go after Kireizky had wrecked all the Christmas work there while defeating the remaining Go-ongers who despair over Kireziky's combo attacks. To fix things, Santa gives the others the inspiring presents from their childhood as S\u014dsuke sets the tree back up and encourages the others not to give up for the sake of the children with Renn showing interest in Santa's bag. The next day, Kireizky is about to sweep the city of Christmas and its population just as Go-on Red arrives in a Santa Claus outfit to fight him with others popping of the bag to get the Rag Grenade off him as the Speedor-powered Go-Roader makes a hit on the Minister. After defeating him with everything in their arsenal to take out his, the Go-ongers return the bag to Santa. However, Kireizky survived the attack through his Bottomless Wastebin as the Go-ongers stand him down."

After learning their friends are still alive, but their location unknown, the primary Go-ongers manage to regain their composure in time as they and the Engines charge to take out some the hundreds of Barbaric Dohmas before combining into Engine-Oh to finish off the rest before the Engines' time limit takes effect.

Even though the Go-ongers were at a disadvantage, the Go-ongers start using the Rocket Daggers, Bridge Axe, and Cowl Laser to turn the tables.

By that time, Yogoshimacritein arrives with the Ministers to point out the futile attempt by Go-ongers before he ordering Kegaleshia and Kitaneidas to attack as they show off their full power. Even though the Go-ongers were at a disadvantage, the Go-ongers start using the Rocket Daggers, Bridge Axe, and Cowl Laser to turn the tables. Yogoshimacritein then uses the Ministers as shields to protect himself, before attempting to use them as suicide bombers to take out the Go-ongers. While the Engines recharge, the Go-ongers decide to put off the search for their friends to expand the Gaiark detection system to stop the Barbaric Dohma menace at the source. Tracking the source of the Barbaric Dohmas' arrival, the Go-ongers make their way to Hellgailles Palace in Engine-Oh. After fighting their way through waves of Ugatz, the Go-ongers are ambushed by the Minsters whom Yogoshimacritein reveals mean nothing more but tools to him. But the two manage to destroy the Bottomless Wastebin that Yogoshimacritein was using as a power source for his Justice Dissolution before he heavily damages them for defying him. Before they shut down, the Ministers reveal to the Go-ongers that their target is Deus Haguru Magear in their chamber of command, which is keeping the other Go-ongers trapped in wave form. When the Go-ongers arrive at the chamber, Yogoshimacritein uses the Deus Haguru Magear as a new power source as the final battle begins.",
