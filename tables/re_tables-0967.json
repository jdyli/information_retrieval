Before the show begins, Chihaya questions the Producer about the removal of the singing section. He advises her to bear with the change. Simultaneously he learns about Chihaya's living situation. As the two teams duel, the host pokes fun of the girls' mistakes while the cameraman takes video from lewd angles. Chihaya becomes fed-up, expresses displeasure, and shocks the studio a little. However, Haruka breaks the silence and the show resumes as normal. As the show takes a break, Chihaya goes to a quiet area to calm herself with singing.

        "Ever since the concert and an article by Yoshizawa, a famous reporter who is a friend of President Takagi, the idols have become very popular to the point of having to wear disguises in public. After appearing on a TV show and going back to their makeup room, Haruka and Yayoi encounter a member of Jupiter, T\u014dma Amagase, who gives them an ominous warning. Back at 765 Production studio, everyone is waiting for a magazine, expecting to see a photo shoot of the idols on the cover, but as Iori brings it, the magazine shows instead Jupiter on the cover. Wanting to know what's going on, Junjir\u014d and Yoshizawa believe this was the work of the President of 961 Production and Jupiter's manager, Takao Kuroi, who used his connections to have the magazine cover changed. It is later revealed that Kuroi and Junjir\u014d were once friends in the music industry, but they had a falling out because Junjir\u014d disapproved Kuroi's methods. Jealous of the 765PRO idols' recent popularity, Kuroi wants revenge against Junjir\u014d by sabotaging his idols using any means necessary. The girls are irritated and attempt to confront Kuroi, but the Producer, Ritsuko and Junjir\u014d tell them they should not fight dirty nor stoop as low as Kuroi does, and if they wish to beat him, they should do it fair and square.

        "Ever since the concert and an article by Yoshizawa, a famous reporter who is a friend of President Takagi, the idols have become very popular to the point of having to wear disguises in public. After appearing on a TV show and going back to their makeup room, Haruka and Yayoi encounter a member of Jupiter, T\u014dma Amagase, who gives them an ominous warning. Back at 765 Production studio, everyone is waiting for a magazine, expecting to see a photo shoot of the idols on the cover, but as Iori brings it, the magazine shows instead Jupiter on the cover. Wanting to know what's going on, Junjir\u014d and Yoshizawa believe this was the work of the President of 961 Production and Jupiter's manager, Takao Kuroi, who used his connections to have the magazine cover changed. It is later revealed that Kuroi and Junjir\u014d were once friends in the music industry, but they had a falling out because Junjir\u014d disapproved Kuroi's methods. Jealous of the 765PRO idols' recent popularity, Kuroi wants revenge against Junjir\u014d by sabotaging his idols using any means necessary. The girls are irritated and attempt to confront Kuroi, but the Producer, Ritsuko and Junjir\u014d tell them they should not fight dirty nor stoop as low as Kuroi does, and if they wish to beat him, they should do it fair and square.

But the magazine slanders her, suggesting the shocked Chihaya, who was there, did nothing and was heartless, and was also responsible for her parents divorce. Chihaya reveals to Haruka that she became an idol to sing in memory of her late brother who loved her singing, but because of the revelation of her past, she is traumatized that if she is unable to sing, Chihaya wants to leave 765 Production studios. As the days past, Chihaya refuses to leave her apartment, much to everyone's worries. Haruka tries her best to help Chihaya, but Chihaya scolds her for being a busybody. After receiving Y\u016b's sketchbook Chihaya's mother gave to Chihaya herself, Haruka asks the Producer if she's just a bother for trying to help everyone, but he assures her that she isn't as it was her enthusiasm that helps him when he was down. After reading Y\u016b's sketchbook, Haruka and Miki have an idea to help Chihaya. Everyone at 765 Pro write and send a song for Chihaya about their feelings to her, hoping she would sing it at the 765 Production's autumn concert. As she has read Y\u016b's sketchbook, Haruka finds out that what made Y\u016b happy wasn't Chihaya's singing, but seeing her smiling. On the day of the Autumn concert, just when everyone is afraid Chihaya won't make it for her part, Chihaya finally arrives. As the music to her song begins, Chihaya is still unable to sing until Haruka and the rest of the idols sing the song for her. With their help and seeing her past self and little brother, Chihaya is finally able to overcome her trauma and finish the song herself. As the crowd applaud her, everyone weeps with Chihaya in celebration.",

        "The Producer manages to survive his accident but remains hospitalized for a while. As a result, Haruka returns to musical rehearsals to channel her grief into her role and wins the lead from Miki. Desperate to get the idols together, Haruka asks Ritsuko to reschedule or cancel her current gigs so she can practice for the New Year's concert, but Ritsuko cannot do it. Miki overhears this and berates Haruka for being selfish, especially after she seized the main role in the musical, and asks Haruka why she wanted to become an idol in the first place. Haruka loses what little confidence she had left and breaks down when she realizes she doesn't even remember her reasons. With Haruka given rest from her work, her friends begin worrying about her. A few days later, Haruka does an errand for her mother until she meets T\u014dma and Jupiter, now under a new company, where they get to know their stage crew thanks to what she and 765 Production taught them. After consulting with the hospitalized Producer, Chihaya gathers the rest of the idols and tells them why Haruka wanted to do dance rehearsal with everyone: Haruka realized everyone was drifting apart and losing their true selves due to their work, and she wanted to do the rehearsal to reunite the bonds they always had. Meanwhile, Haruka meets a group of kindergarteners and sings with them until she sees a younger version of herself who brings her to the stadium where the 765 Production thank-you concert was held. Then she remembers that she became an idol to sing, dance and make people happy together with her friends, and her younger self, now looking older than when she became an idol, ensures Haruka that her friends believe in her. As Haruka runs back to 765 Production studios, the idols make a live broadcast announcing their New Year's concert and apologizing to Haruka for not realizing what she was doing. Glad to see this, Haruka reunites with her friends.",

A PR campaign is launched, with Kotetsu and Barnaby visiting Hero Academy alongside Ivan \"Origami Cyclone\" Karelin, who has a lot of self-doubt about his worth as a hero. Ivan's closest friend and classmate, Edward, was the best student of Hero Academy, until he accidentally shot a hostage he was trying to save and was imprisoned on murder charges. Edward escapes from prison and attacks Ivan, blaming him for hesitating to back him up during the incident. Kotetsu rescues Ivan and encourages him to stop Edward. Ivan confronts Edward, who is attacked by Lunatic. Kotetsu and Barnaby arrive on the scene and learn that Lunatic's targets are not members of Ouroboros, but murderers. Kotetsu is injured by Lunatic's fire, but he also manages to break part of his mask, forcing him to flee. After Edward is put back into police custody, Ivan vows to move out of the background, whilst Barnaby wonders why Kotetsu does so much for him.

Having no further use of Rotwang, Maverick kills him, boasting that he will escape justice thanks to his reputation and NEXT power. However, Agnes, who recovered her memory when she saw Kaede use Maverick's power on television, reveals that she has been broadcasting Maverick's rant live. Exposed and cornered, Maverick takes Kaede hostage, but she is saved by Kotetsu, who had only passed out from the pain of his wounds. After revealing that he is not the leader of Ouroboros, Maverick uses his power on himself, leaving him in a stupor. Maverick is taken into custody, only to be killed by Lunatic. Kotetsu announces his retirement, with Barnaby deciding to retire too, so he can start his own life. A year later, Kotetsu, despite his further diminished power, returns to his hero duties, followed by Barnaby shortly after. In an epilogue scene, a Stern Dollar bill dropped in a puddle of water reveals the Ouroboros logo hidden under the ink.",

Before the case starts, Ran and Sonoko manage to win Shinichi (by cheating) and his penalty is to accept any favors from anyone for the whole day. Suddenly, Kogoro calls in that he needs his help to go on a deep-undercover investigation, which he realize a bit too late as he realize it's a ruse. Turns out that a married couple, Motoki Kensuke and Shimabara Kanon are celebrating their marriage in Kensuke's restaurant 'Diavel's Kiss' and Kogoro asks him to help him make preparations for the wedding. Not breaking Ran's promise, he does so. During his time, he receives a threat telegram that was supposed to be for one of the couples. As the wedding starts, after his speech, he ask the couples to kiss while Shinichi was still thinking that the telegram was just a prank. However, one of the guest, Masumoto Nana, who was drunk, dies from poison after drinking some of the guests' drinks. As Sato and Takagi arrived at the scene, it was revealed that Nana died from allergic reaction to soba. After further investigation, Shinichi finally reveals that the culprit was the bride Kanon. Kanon figures out that Kensuke's having an affair with Nana so before the kissing ceremony, she eats curry with soba in it and uses Kensuke after giving a kiss to him, transferring the soba to Kensuke's lips. Before being taken away by the police, Kogoro lectures Kanon that Nana had envied her due to being in love with a man Kanon truly loves as both Nana and Kanon hold a complex to each other. If both have quarrel and more honest, both of them would be true friends in the end than having grudges towards each other. Suddenly, after the case is over, Ran came over hearing about the 'kiss' part and beats both Shinichi and her father down. Back in the white room, he keys in the 'Kiss' Word and the door opens. As they enter the room, the panel shows with a question \"Last year which day did you first eat saury?\" with a 30 second time limit. Shinichi keys in 25 September 2010 and the timer starts with another question \"When was the last day you drank tea?\".

The case begins where Ran and Shinichi in disguise were spying on Kogoro with Takagi (since they need access to the club). They notice a famous professor, Mine Mashito with Kumi while Kogoro with Kyoko. Soon it was game time, Kiss-Kiss Derby in which both Kogoro and Mashito was selected. The game rules are that both men takes turns, receiving kisses from the 20 ladies who are lined up then pour wine into their glasses. The winner will be given a special kiss from Kumi. During the game, both men get kisses from the ladies (which infuriates Ran). The winner happens to be Mine and once Kumi drank the wine, she was about to kiss when she collapses. Shinichi checks on her and sadly she has already passed away. During investigation, it reveals that Kumi has died from drinking wolf's bane that was inside Kyoko's container. However, Kyoko denies it as she doesn't know it at all. Shinichi notices the line-up draw on the white board and sees that Kyoko was No.16. He deduces that the culprit must be a whiz in maths since the game only lets the contestants choose between 1 and 3, there's higher chances that the poison was in Kyoko's wine. Oddly, all the girls seem to be very happy that Kumi's gone, even going so far as to take down the picture. As the investigation progresses, Kogoro suspects it was Mashito but Shinichi proves that it was Kazuyo who poisoned Kumi. The proof is that she knows one of the lines that mathematician Rene Descartes says, in which Mine knows about it since Mashito told her. Her motive was that she had fallen in love with Mashito since last Christmas as she's the only person who talk as serious as she does. However, she overhears Kumi's conversation that she's planning to cheat Mashito with his money and plans to murder Kumi to protect Mashito. As she's been taken away while Mashito cried in grief, Kogoro noted that Kyoko learns maths just for Mashito so she'll used him to make him remember her for all his life as lover.

        "Two scooters come into the shop, one from the twenties and one from the fifties, both of which are family heirlooms for the customer. Rick and Tyler have a contest to see who can finish their scooter the fastest. Rick's has more parts and a wooden base, and is thus harder to work on by hand, but he manages to finish it by himself. Tyler, on the other hand, despite having the simpler project, decides to get help. He sandblasts the parts without tracing the artwork first, so they have to look up another of the same kind. Tyler, attempting to \"even the odds\", steals one of the spokes from Rick's project. Both scooters are finished on time. Meanwhile, a regular customer wants a 1940s candy machine restored. The mechanism is missing, so Rick has to search for one. Originally red, the machine is painted teal.",

Prostitution, gambling, and drug abuse (particularly of opium) were widespread. Chinese criminal secret societies (analogous to modern-day triads) were extremely powerful; some had tens of thousands of members, and turf wars between rival societies occasionally led to death tolls numbering in the hundreds. Attempts to suppress these secret societies had limited success, and they continued to be a problem well into the 20th century."

The heroes are quickly called in to chase after a thief named Robin Baxter, who has stolen a statue that represents the importance of heroes. The heroes chase after him into an amusement park but find him near-impossible to catch due to his NEXT ability to instantly switch places with anyone that he can see, leading to some infights amongst the heroes.
