Until the last minute, JB keeps on professing how much he loves her and even strips himself of his pride. As such, Celine weakens with JB\u2019s great love for her. With Jackie\u2019s urging, Eli seeks a truce with Fidel back home. Yet despite his humility, Fidel still turns his back on them. Soon after that, Eli and Jackie begin to relocate in their new house. Jackie can\u2019t help feeling sad though so Eli assures her that nothing really matters as long as they are together. Meanwhile, Corazon suddenly proposes marriage to Mateo just to appease his ruffled feelings. He then gives her an engagement ring in front of Daniel. To protect his friend however, Daniel tells Corazon to sign a pre-nuptial agreement. Mateo is enraged by this suggestion but later realizes the wisdom of it.",

Tomas and Corazon on the other hand were greeted by a band with a message for Corazon which gave Tomas an idea that she was having an affair."

Veron got trapped inside the compound but Mateo was able to get her out just in time. Eli and Fidel arrived to help Lena. Fidel tried to protect his daughter from the press but Lena was offended that her father was more concerned about his family\u2019s reputation than her mother\u2019s life. Eli on the other hand tried to find Veron. He saw her with Mateo and led her to daughter. Fidel, Eli, Lena and Veron returned to the mansion and now that her mother is homeless, Lena asked to let her mother stay with them for the meantime. Later on, it was revealed that the fire was Mateo\u2019s doing as part of his plans to get revenge from Fidel. Meanwhile, Celine\u2019s condition is getting worse and JB has vowed to stay by her side until she gets better."

By this time, Jackie has also discovered that she is pregnant. But she still checks on her ailing cousin who advises her to mend fences with Eli.

Much to their surprise, Jackie suddenly arrives and catches them in an intimate situation! Eli tries to explain that she had it wrong but Jackie already accuses him and Lena of fooling her all along.

He tries his best to woo his wife back but she demands space for herself and her grieving dad. As such, Eli spends the following days in a drunken stupor. As soon as JB arrives home from the trial, he finds Celine lying unconscious on the floor. He then brings her to the hospital where he learns that Celine\u2019s cancer has relapsed! By this time, Jackie has also discovered that she is pregnant. But she still checks on her ailing cousin who advises her to mend fences with Eli. Meanwhile, Lena returns from her trip in the province with the news that Joaquin is already dead. She drops by Eli\u2019s house to share his grief with Jackie. But since her sister is not there, she ends up commiserating with him. Intoxicated, Lena begins to kiss Eli, thinking that he\u2019s Joaquin. Much to their surprise, Jackie suddenly arrives and catches them in an intimate situation! Eli tries to explain that she had it wrong but Jackie already accuses him and Lena of fooling her all along. The stressful fight causes her to bleed and lose her baby yet again.",

After talking to Celine though, Eli tries to get past Fidel to see his wife again but the latter stops him by force. In another instance, Lena also explains to her sister that for one crazy moment, she thought Eli was Joaquin so she kissed him that night. But her admission that she wanted to steal Eli away from her before only proves that she\u2019s really at fault. To her shame, Lena bids Fidel goodbye then leaves the home that she has come to love. In the prison, Mateo expresses his gratitude to Lolo Bogs for taking care of his daughter all these years. At the same time, he announces his intention to make Onay his sole heir as well as the head of his business. Instead of getting excited, Onay begs Mateo to find it in his heart to accept her brother. Because despite the conflicts between them, she believes that Mateo still cares for Eli. Meanwhile, Celine\u2019s health worsens with each passing day. Hence, she asks Onay to promise to be there, perhaps for JB, even if she\u2019s gone. Then one night, she wakes JB up just to take her back to the place where they first fell in love with each other.",

It finally dawns upon him that it's too late to fix his marriage so he meets up with Jackie to tell her that he will cooperate with their process of annulment. Back in Mateo\u2019s company, Onay presents her new marketing ideas to the board but JB embarrasses her again by discrediting her report. Later, she learns that JB hates the mere sight of her because she reminds him of Celine so much."

        "Eli suffers from his nightmares again. And this time, he gets a clear image of the man who's calling for help. He describes him to Jackie who in turn makes a sketch of the mystery guy. The next day, they ask the police to conduct a search on him. Later, the couple happily share their day with Fidel and Monique. The subject of raising a family comes up so Eli and Jackie take the opportunity to reveal their plans about establishing a home of their own. Meanwhile, JB comes home with his first big paycheck much to the delight of Celine. He explains to her though that the coming months will be a lot busier at the office and he might be needed to stay on-site with Vanessa for a week.Celine accepts this news understandingly. After showing indifference for quite a while, Veron finally talks to Lena again. Veron is glad to hear that things are going smoothly for Lena at the Madrigals\u2019 and decides that it\u2019s time now to think about her own happiness. As such, Lena is shocked to see her mother gone during her next visit.",

Rita at Joaquin\u2019s house. Eli found Lena there but she refused to join him on his way home."

Jackie frantically searches for Eli and finds him in the crash. Meanwhile, Celine goes through her treatment and she and JB meet Onay at the hospital. When they returned to the spa, Celine tries to act normal in front of employees and guests, unaware that Corazon and Tomas are watching from afar. Tomas concludes that JB was only trying to con his own mother for money but she insisted otherwise. Suddenly, Mateo appears on the scene to talk to Corazon but she refused to talk to him. On the other hand, Lena has returned home to Veron and the two reconnect. She promised never to return to the Madrigals but Mateo convinces her that she should return for her and her mother\u2019s sake. However, a mysterious man sets the nearby houses on fire and the shanties are suddenly eaten up by flames. Meanwhile, Eli has nightmares and wakes up screaming Lena\u2019s name.",

        "Tomas is livid with anger catching Corazon in her tryst with Mateo. Drawn to violence as usual, he beats her up as soon as they reach home. Tomas drags her in the stairway where Corazon falls after one of his hard blows. As if that wasn\u2019t enough, Tomas retrieves his gun and shoots her. Though obviously in pain, Corazon struggles to fight for her life. Mateo is worried sick with Corazon\u2019s plight. As such, he calls JB to tell him what\u2019s happened and both of them immediately went to her rescue. Mateo reaches her first and a brawl ensues followed by JB\u2019s arrival. But as JB carried his mom to safer grounds, Tomas suddenly gets the upper hand against Mateo, pulls the trigger and shoots the young man. Tomas runs away while Mateo rushes the wounded mother and son to the hospital. Meanwhile, Celine gets another one of her painful attacks while trying to locate JB. Good thing Onay also felt her pain and gets to her in time. Oblivious that JB\u2019s also in danger, she chances upon Eli and Jackie in the same hospital. After seeing that Celine\u2019s now in good hands, Onay bids them goodbye. But before she takes her leave, she learns too that JB got injured. Later, Celine dreams of JB where she pleads for him to stay. In her dream, JB gives her a promise that he will never leave her side. This seems to appease Celine\u2019s troubled thoughts hence, paving the way for her peaceful sleep. On the other hand, Mateo is up for his final revenge against Tomas. His gunmen catch Tomas in a deserted place where he is thrashed. Pleading for his life, Tomas reiterates that the past is all Fidel\u2019s fault, not his. However, Mateo did not stop his goons from killing him.",

        "Gloria visits Corazon but the latter remains indifferent towards her concern. Corazon drives Gloria away but before she leaves, Mateo arrives, leaving her in shock for she sees how Mateo is still obviously taken with her sister. Onay is deeply concerned with Celine and JB's critical condition. As such, she decides to stay in the hospital. Though Celine remains unconscious, Onay continues to talk to her, asking her not to give up, until the former finally stirs from her deep slumber. Onay immediately calls Jackie and Eli, from whom Celine learns about JB\u2019s accident. Meanwhile, Lena meets a famed clairvoyant known as Impo. As usual, she\u2019s hoping to discover Joaquin\u2019s whereabouts. But just like what other fortunetellers have told her, Impo says while it is true that Joaquin loves her, the time has not yet come for them to be reunited. What infuriates Lena though is the old woman\u2019s dark foreboding that she should loathe the day they meet again instead of anticipating it. Back in the hospital, Corazon worries about JB but Mateo assures her that her son is in good hands. Then he tells her how the police has found Tomas' dead body. Corazon bursts out in tears, not because she grieves her lover's death but because she's finally free from the man's cruelty. Outside the ward, Mateo chances upon Gloria who thanks him for his support and acceptance of their son. However, Mateo gives her the cold shoulder and exclaims that with the way things are going, she really doesn\u2019t have anything to be grateful for. To Eli though, Mateo easily acts like a doting father.",

        "Mateo finds Veron in tears after her bitter tiff with Lena. However, he insists that Lena was right in pointing out that Veron still pines after Fidel. And if stealing him from Monique is her plan, she's only bound to lose. Mateo further tells her that it's unfair of her to let Lena carry the same burden. Veron realizes the logic of this but she is mad at Fidel's family for getting Lena's sympathy. Jackie opens up to Monique that it's not healthy anymore for Fidel and Eli to live under the same roof. Monique is instantly shocked with the idea of them moving out. She asks Jackie to give her and Fidel enough time to adjust to this thought before they actually find a new home. Back at the spa, Celine is worried sick since JB hasn't called from the office yet. She almost convinces Onay to call the police station when JB suddenly arrives. But instead of breathing a sigh of relief, Celine is annoyed by the thought that a girl had driven him home. She confronts JB about it, but JB innocently shakes it off. However, Celine remains suspicious until the next day. Meanwhile, Eli visits his brother in jail. There he happens to see Pong leading his inmates in an upbeat dance-exercise. Eli is happy to note that Pong is really adjusting well to his life in prison. Pong explains that he's just thankful for the chance to start afresh. He even cites Eli's near-death experience, which proves that like him, Eli is also given back his life for a reason.",

Rosales for he tells her that he found a lead to Joaquin\u2019s whereabouts. Lena is thrilled to be reunited at last with Joaquin and she dolls up for the meeting. However, this development results to Eli\u2019s vision of the mysterious dove, covered with blood for the first time. Corazon finally meets Veron in person when she drops by Mateo\u2019s penthouse. Veron remains undaunted by her arrogance though and even mocks her words. As such, Corazon reports the whole incident to Mateo, who in turn, apologizes for Veron\u2019s actions.

She does not listen to the evil counsellors, (who want her) to deny god, who lives up in heaven. Not for gold, nor silver, nor jewels, not for the king's threats or entreaties, nothing could ever persuade the girl not to love continually the service of God. And for this reason she was brought before Maximian, who was king in those days over the pagans. He exhorts her \u2014 but she does not care \u2014 to abandon the name of Christian; She gathers up her strength.\" / \"And subsequently worship his god. She would rather undergo persecution Than lose her spiritual purity. For these reasons she died in great honor. They threw her into the fire so that she would burn quickly. She had no sins, for this reason she did not burn. The pagan king did not want to give in to this; He ordered her head to be cut off with a sword. The girl did not oppose that idea: She wants to abandon earthly life, and she calls upon Christ. In the form of a dove she flew to heaven. Let us all pray that she will deign to pray for us That Christ may have mercy on us And may allow us to come to Him after death Through His grace.\""

        "Jackie visits her home with Eli for the last time, filling herself with their memories together before she starts afresh with her dad in a far-off place. After three months, Eli also begins to pick up the pieces in his life though he still hopes to find Jackie one day. Pong who has just gotten out of prison advises him to stop his futile search of Jackie, to no avail. At a bus station going to San Rafael, Eli catches a vague glimpse of Jackie but fails to catch her as she went ahead of him and Pong. Onay on the other hand takes refuge at Celine\u2019s favorite island where she sings at a bar to pass time. Eli has a hint that the reason for her sudden need for solitude is her growing feelings for JB. JB is in fact missing her company but is not yet ready to admit that he\u2019s falling for Onay too. But while searching through Celine\u2019s memoirs, JB stumbles upon a CD similar to the one Onay receives from the mail, containing Celine\u2019s last message to them!",
