        "When Carlene takes the GCBs down to unincorporated Juarez for the groundbreaking ceremony for the Condos for Christian Living, the GCBs find themselves in danger, they're in the middle of the desert. Meanwhile Amanda's suspicions regarding Luke lead to a surprising discovery about Ripp. Ripp has a secret daughter in Mexico! Masson Massy discovered that Blake is gay (which he is but still wants a child) and Blake and Cricket don't know what to do. At the end, in a bar, Pastor Tudor kisses Amanda."

        "Moran first appeared as a dock worker in Los Angeles where Victor Newman, who had lost his memory, had taken a job. When Victor, believing his name was \"Christian\", wanted to fight the management for better working conditions, Moran was seen talking suspiciously on the phone to someone about a plan. In reality, they were planning an explosion to kill \"Christian\" so he would leave the management alone. Sister Celeste, a nun with a neighboring homeless mission, declared to everyone that \"Christian\" had died in the explosion when he had really survived so that the management and Moran would back off.
