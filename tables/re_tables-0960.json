        "School back in session, Daigo reiterates his discontent to Kazuma about rejecting Madoka on their way to class. As Kazuma tries to explain otherwise, she happily catches up to them. Class out for the day, and walking home together, Ibuki neutrally warns Ui that unless she confesses to Kazuma soon, someone else might; including herself. That night, as both girls ponder the conversation, Ayumu calls Ui and asks if she will model for him the next day. That morning, acting on behalf of this, Senka shoos Kazuma out of the inn. Aimless and bored, he decides to visit the shopping district, bumping into Ibuki along the way. The two instead travel together to Honchou and spend the day playing arcade games, trying on clothes, dining, and singing karaoke. Back at the house, Ayumu takes a break and sits with Ui who is surprised to learn that the drawing is a gift for Kazuma, as he believes they're dating. As the day closes in, Ui bids her regards and walks home, upset. Sitting at the park, Ibuki happily thanks Kazuma for their time out, jokingly describing them as a couple and though serious, playfully asks him out. He sharply turns down the offer and leaves; though a minute or so into doing this, runs back to apologize. Fighting the urge to cry, Ibuki, heartwrenched, maintains her offer was a joke; returning home as rainclouds drench her. Back home, discontent with her behavior from her brother's marriage, Ui calls him to the surprise that his wife, Kuriko, is pregnant. Ibuki heads to the overlook early in the morning to vent about Kazuma. As she heads to school, Ui catches up, overjoyed that she is going to be an aunt.",

        "The sons of the Prophet are brave men and bold And quite unaccustomed to fear, But the bravest by far in the ranks of the Shah, Was Abdul Abulbul Amir. If you wanted a man to encourage the van, Or harass the foe from the rear, Storm fort or redoubt, you had only to shout For Abdul Abulbul Amir. Now the heroes were plenty and well known to fame In the troops that were led by the Czar, And the bravest of these was a man by the name Of Ivan Skavinsky Skavar. He could jump twenty yards and tell fortunes at cards, and strum on the Spanish guitar. In fact quite the cream of the Muscovite team Was Ivan Skavinsky Skavar. One day this bold Russian, he shouldered his gun And donned his most truculent sneer, Downtown he did go where he trod on the toe Of Abdul Abulbul Amir. Young man, quoth Abdul, has life grown so dull That you wish to end your career? Vile infidel, know, you have trod on the toe Of Abdul Abulbul Amir. So take your last look at the sunshine and brook And send your regrets to the Czar For by this I imply, you are going to die, Count Ivan Skavinsky Skavar. Then this bold Mameluke drew his trusty skibouk, Singing, \"Allah! Il Allah! Al-lah!\" And with murderous intent he ferociously went For Ivan Skavinsky Skavar. They parried and thrust, they side-stepped and cussed, Of blood they spilled a great part; The philologist blokes, who seldom crack jokes, Say that hash was first made on the spot. They fought all that night neath the pale yellow moon; The din, it was heard from afar, And huge multitudes came, so great was the fame, Of Abdul and Ivan Skavar. As Abdul's long knife was extracting the life, In fact he was shouting, \"Huzzah!\" He felt himself struck by that wily Calmuck, Count Ivan Skavinsky Skavar. The Sultan drove by in his red-breasted fly, Expecting the victor to cheer, But he only drew nigh to hear the last sigh, Of Abdul Abulbul Amir. There's a tomb rises up where the Blue Danube rolls, And graved there in characters clear, Is, \"Stranger, when passing, oh pray for the soul Of Abdul Abulbul Amir.\" A splash in the Black Sea one dark moonless night Caused ripples to spread wide and far, It was made by a sack fitting close to the back, Of Ivan Skavinsky Skavar. A Muscovite maiden her lone vigil keeps, 'Neath the light of the cold northern star, And the name that she murmurs in vain as she weeps, Is Ivan Skavinsky Skavar."

        "On the night Sarah is to babysit Jane with Ethan and Benny, Rory accidentally ruins the cable, leaving the 5 of them bored. They find a board game that allows its players to talk to spirits. Sarah decides not to play and goes upstairs with Jane. Ethan reads the rules of the game, and he, Benny and Rory talk to a friendly spirit. After dismissing it, Rory plays alone and breaks the rules of the game, causing a demon spirit to unleash. The demon possesses Sarah and wreaks havoc in the house. The boys dig up the Cubile Animus and successfully suck the demon out of Sarah, just before Ethan's parents come home. However, all is not well when, unknown to the boys, a hand pokes out from the spot where they dug up the box, implying that Jesse has awakened from his grave. Kate Todd as Erica does not appear in this episode.",

An investigation revealed that Yanis had stolen the guns from his father and put them into a duffel bag, which he handed to a friend with the words to \"hold onto it\". After checking the bag Yanis' friend told his mother of the weapons, who then forced him to get rid of them by throwing them into a river. After his arrest Yanis admitted that he had planned to shoot people at his school he didn't like, before committing suicide."

The suspect was then pulled from class and later arrested. Shortly after, two airsoft pistols were found in his backpack, one of them looking very much like a real gun. The plan of the 13-year-old student was to force the school in lock down and shoot anybody who tried to escape. He is charged with terroristic threats and reckless endangerment and is currently held in juvenile detention. He is also charged with burglary for stealing $370 from another school in Drexel Hill on the previous weekend. It is noted that the suspect has a history of mental illness."

Alcivar was an innocent bystandard who sat next to the intended target. When trying to escape, he was apprehended by Howard Barnes, a security guard working with a television crew filming nearby. When he was told to drop his gun, Liebeskind fired a shot at Barnes, hitting him in the thigh. Barnes returned fire and hit the gunman twice in the chest, leaving him critically wounded. The shooting was apparently sparked, because of a dispute between Liebeskind and another student who left his motorcycle helmet in his seat."
