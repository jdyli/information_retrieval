Without their powers, they are easily defeated, but as Necrolai steps in to finish the Rangers off, the Tribunal reverses the wish after witnessing the Rangers' bravery. The Rangers, with their powers back, quickly defeat the Hidiacs, but 50-Below and Fightoe are sent to earth again, and after being beaten badly, the Rangers realize they have taken their magic for granted. In the underworld, Jenji tricks Leelee into letting him go and he quickly teleports to Rootcore. When the Tribunal believes the Rangers have learned their lesson, they grant them new power: Legend Mode, turning the Rangers into the Legend Warriors. The Rangers defeat 50-Below and then proceed to use the Manticore Megazord to defeat Ursus, a mechanical being powered by Fightoe. In the end the Rangers celebrate the Rock-Porium's anniversary with a cake that, while not made with magic and not as nice looking as it could be, is very much appreciated by Toby.",

The Master decides it is time to take care of things himself, starting with The Light. After taking over Nick's body, he proceeds to destroy the Mystic Village. Nick then dons Koragg's armor, taking Leanbow with him to Rootcore for one final showdown, trashing it in the process. Nick manages to break free of the Master's hold, expelling The Master into the real world. The Snow Prince then appears in Rootcore, bringing news that the Mystic Realm has been destroyed, along with Mystic Mother (the reformed Rita Repulsa).

The Rangers, along with Udonna, are seemingly defeated as they lay on the ground, powerless. Leanbow and Daggeron combine their powers in one final attempt to destroy The Master, but their magic is too weak. After The Master devours their magic, Daggeron takes a blow for Leanbow, and is destroyed. Back in the upper world, Jenji shields the Rangers from one of Sculpin's attacks, and is destroyed.

        "Nick, not willing to give up, fights Black Lance, destroying him with the other Rangers. The Master then arrives, spitting out a dead Daggeron and Leanbow. The Master then devours time until they are in the future, a dead, barren, and dark wasteland. After fighting The Master in Legend Mode, their Legend powers are taken away. Nick uses all his remaining power and forces The Master to spit out the time he has devoured. Though The Master then threatens to destroy them, they are saved by the Snow Prince and Clare. Mystic Mother apparently lived by turning herself into energy before being destroyed. As The Master decides to retreat, Udonna appears along with Itassis and Necrolai. Itassis tells how Necrolai saved her, and how she destroyed Sculpin with the power of courage. Leanbow and Daggeron are revived by Necrolai's power, while Jenji seems to have also returned to his normal self. Necrolai was turned into a human thanks to the good energy she absorbed. The humans, led by Toby, and the mystical creatures, led by Phineas, band together to return the magic to the Rangers. The Rangers stand together and take on The Master with all their fury and power, destroying him with their overwhelming magic. The story wraps up with everyone working together once again, the worlds united, having a party in Toby's store. Madison tells Nick to come back for her. He gives her his baby blanket. Meanwhile, Nick, Udonna, and Leanbow ride off into the sunset, with Fire Heart rushing behind. Clare, now a sorceress and resident of Rootcore, turns away from the Xenotome, smiles, and vanishes, leaving behind \"The End\".
