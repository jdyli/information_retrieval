        "The Tulip is pursued and crippled by The Raiders, but Senaca calls his fighters off and prepares his misson to destroy what is left of Earth with the bioweapon seeds. Luc makes contact with Navarre in hopes of warning the Orchard of Seneca's plans. She then goes to Mars to form a resistance force but time is running out. Meanwhile, Eccleston returns from the \"other side\" and helps both Travis and Dante unlock their untapped powers. Father and son use a shuttle to intercept Seneca's forces in hopes of psychically willing the seeds away from them, but the shuttle is hit by a missile and begins to burn up in the atmosphere. Meanwhile the Tulip comes under attack by a barrage of missiles and Eccleston uses the last of his power to make the ship vanish to another dimension and taking Percy with it. At the last second before impact, Dante finds himself 10 years back in time on Titan, with his wife Penny and young son Travis. An air-raid siren sounds as the Raiders begin their attack on the Titan colony and Dante appears to relive the event all over again.",

        "Having fled from The Orchard into hyperspace, each Tulip crew member finds themselves in their own pocket reality, but a problem in all realities is that the ship's molecules are destabilizing due to a warp bubble imbalance. Elsewhere in hyperspace, Travis finds Xeylon, who explains how to activate his Divinity Cluster power. Travis only wishes to return to the point in time where Callie is shot and try to stop it. Meanwhile, Catchpole lurks aboard the Tulip jumping from each reality and observing the crew as they establish a way to stabilize the ship. Once they do, he steals the horizon generator and returns to the Orchard HQ on Mars, but he kills Murchison and takes over the Hyperspace project. Travis eventually alters time and saves Callie's life. They all return to the Tulip but without the horizon generator the ship remains stuck in hyperspace. Xeylon has a theory on getting back but risks destroying the ship if it fails. The series ends there in a cliffhanger.",
