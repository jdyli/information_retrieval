        "Deflated by Christophore explaining him that a gasoline pump is simply not going to be, Porphyras is disappointed that his trademark pastime of watching automobiles is insufficient for dispelling his anxiety for Patagos-ke's micro-economy as it becomes community discourse that Christophore can repair but not fuel automobiles when Za\u00efmis approaches him for counsel in how to be a good big brother to the baby gestating within his mother Dolly; once he gets over the initial shock of the entreaty, Porphyras is not slow in explaining Za\u00efmis his perspective of the proper resolution. Running second place to Porphyras's worries about the Patagos-ke micro-economy is his anguish that Marina's cerebral computations now revolve around the movie the family saw in Ioannina; while Anek divides her energies between reliving how Christophore swept her off her feet and explaining Porphyras the advent of that same desire within Marina, the issue of subsequent siblings becomes the centerpiece of the evening discourse when Za\u00efmis misapplies Porphyras's postnatal counsel while Marina signals an interest in being a big sister. The next day has as its feature presentation the answer to scant commerce when a chance encounter with the customer Christophore helped yesterday inspires Porphyras to initiate a desperate and ignoble initiative that poses quite an ethical imbroglio for Za\u00efmis whose dissemination of this data is of null utility to Marina when she finds that Porphyras is as eager to caustically criticize her play-acting as she is to dissuade him from placing the nails.

A Gypsy woman named Isabella takes notice of Marina as she computes whether to go investigate before the bar owner loudly reminds her that there is a significant portion of the workday remaining; while Isabella files away her observing Marina for future reference prior to going back on the job, it soon becomes evident that Marina is a country girl clearly out of her element in the city when she is spellbound at the huge ferry and all the people boarding it. By the time Marina finally catches up to a woman that looks like her mother Anek, the ferry has set sail for Italy just as Porphyras arrives at the wharf at a loss for what to do next if it turns out that Marina is no longer in Greece; meanwhile, Isabella soon demonstrates that she wears multiple hats as a dancer and an augur while her assistant Carlos prosecutes rigged poker games with her father Django in order to bilk people of money. Much to the despondent orphan's good fortune, Marina's play-acting inspires Isabella to ultimately come above-ground with the anguishing prologue involving her dead daughter Lili which looks exactly like Marina; after an impromptu daybreak concert, Isabella's decision to serve as Marina's family government becomes the genesis of Marina's cerebral software starting to slowly repair itself and also inaugurates Porphyras into an odyssey that requires him to exhume, examine, execute, and exploit numerous fundamental mechanics both local and global in order to reunite with Marina.",

The dysphoric reality of Maximilian returning without any data about Marina is heavily counterbalanced by a stowaway consolation prize that all but bulldozes over him in the process of leaping out to greet Porphyras \u2014 a vivacious Daisy that prefers to be a kid rather than a workplace show-and-tell project. Seeking to return the favor of being shown the blossoming olives, Daisy acts as a tour guide to the leather workshop where her father Dario works; upon seeing a recently completed leather handbag, Maximilian decides to commission its emulation as a gift for Ilaria. It is during the trek to the Martini-ke olive processing facility that Porphyras comes to grips with the fact that he will have to leave Caulonia one day to resume his search for Marina; galvanized by insight from a carnival stevedore to travel west toward Calabria, Porphyras declares his intention to hit the road. As can be predicted, there is anguish galore as Rebecca and Daisy ultimately find that Porphyras came into their lives for a reason and stayed for a season that has now expired; stymied by the behind-schedule westbound train, Porphyras decides to stowaway on a freight train.",

        "The confusion about where to go next upon landing in Rome quickly dissipates when Captain Barnes greets Porphyras in a paternal tone that clearly illuminates how frightened he was for the orphan's safety; upon learning of Marina falling into the company of Isabella and her father Django along with her husband Carlos, Captain Barnes drives to a hotel where he makes certain the owner will do a good job. Upon getting settled into his room, Captain Barnes leaves Porphyras with a letter from Za\u00efmis prior returning to his duties; now secluded in his room, Za\u00efmis is not slow in getting across how frightened he was for Porphyras's safety along with explaining that he is residing in Timiza with his mother Dolly and his neonate sister Elpida. This becomes the backdrop for a reminiscence sequence for several of the series's earlier events \u2014 Anek explaining her prologue, Christophore's return from Athens, Marina's birthday, meeting Alessia, Porphyras being caught off guard by the earthquake, retrieving Christophore's automotive tools, and Marina going MIA in Patras; the divergence is that the focus is upon the epilogue of Porphyras losing track of Marina as experienced by Za\u00efmis. Porphyras decides to compose a reply explaining his early adventures of working in Patras to earn the boat fare, learning to face his limitations in Brindisi, and all the misadventures to ultimately get back on the trail; even as Marina somehow picks up him bellowing out her name while accompanying Isabella in spite of her damaged cerebral software, Porphyras does not realize the insidious obstacles awaiting him in Rome that could literally snatch defeat from the jaws of victory.",

After nullifying a robbery attempt by a highwayman, Porphyras comes upon a produce vendor named Samuel who has no data regarding Marina's whereabouts but indicates that he will ultimately prosecute a return trip to France; while it is not difficult to detain Samuel so that he can stow away, Porphyras barely escapes being lanced by the sentries \u2014 but not Samuel wanting to see his boarding pass!!!",
        "The progress toward approaching the France-Italy border that Porphyras has made is not insignificant; still, the same can be said for the remaining distance \u2014 and the turbulent trauma of having his late parents Anek and Christophore crushed under the rubble of his childhood home along with losing track of Marina near Patras. As if to reprimand him for not taming his anguish and properly appraising good will, Porphyras finds that the \u00bblodging fee\u00ab for catching forty winks is finding himself face-to face with an idealistic but slothful young man that calls himself Michel who wants to go to Paris in order to further refine himself as an artist in spite of the fact that his mother is hostile to this ambition and would rather that he help out on the farm; seeing that neither the plaintiff nor the defendant is demonstrating any of the good faith that makes arbitration possible, Porphyras decides to voice his disgust of the ongoing adversarial divergent concourse prior to resuming his journey furious that Michel wants to wield him as a vector to run away from home.

At the same time, MegaMan battles NetNavi Skullman who warns him he should not enter the Undernet if he can not beat him.

They are able to rectify the misunderstanding by revealing the existence of Dark MegaMan. Later, MegaMan meets with NetNavi BubbleMan who promises to share information for a price. While MegaMan is gone, Dark MegeMan attacks his friends allowing LaserMan to call out GutsMan's Dark Soul and provoking him to attack MegaMan. MegaMan is able to help GutsMan break control and the two form a Double-Soul to force Dark MegaMan to flee. BubbleMan reveals the location of a black hole the Dark Loids used to enter their world. MegaMan enters in FullSynchro mode. However, their Synchro is broken and Lan's consciousness is abducted by ShadeMan. Giving into his hatred, MegaMan deletes ShadeMan causing Dark MegaMan to strengthen. SearchMan and his army attempt to defeat Dark MegaMan but are annihilated instead. Gravely injured, SearchMan gives MegaMan his strength allowing him to Double-Soul and confront Dark MegaMan whom absorbs Bass in the process."
