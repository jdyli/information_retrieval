        "Goku, Bulma, and Oolong drive into a city to get gas. Everyone in this town seems to be afraid of Bulma, but after she buys some new clothes and gets rid of her bunny costume, no one even notices her. Just as they're about to leave, two men in bunny ears begin to hassle them. Goku beats both of them up, so they call in \"the boss\". The boss, whose name is Monster Carrot, arrives. He is a giant rabbit whose special power is his touch; if you touch him, you turn into a carrot. Not knowing this, Bulma slaps him, turning her into a carrot, which Monster Carrot grabs. Watching from behind a wall, Puar turns into a bird and snatches the carrot out of his hand. Goku then hits him with his Power Pole, forcing Monster Carrot to surrender. He changes Bulma back. Goku then ties up Monster Carrot and his henchmen and takes them to the moon by extending his Power Pole, proceeding to force them to make treats for children."

Goku tries to follow, but loses him. Luckily, Goku still has the Four-Star Ball, so Pilaf can't make his wish. Bulma's Dyno-Caps were in her suitcase as well, so they have no ride.

        "Goku and Chi Chi reach the mountain, but as they get close, a blizzard starts up. They meet an old woman named Octagon. She tells the mountain is disrupted by the presence of females but knows nothing about the Bansho fan. Goku goes to the mountain to gather snow while Pilaf, Shu and Mai are searching after the fan. The mountain starts up another blizzard. The cold weather prevents Pilaf from firing missiles and flamethrowers on Goku. Hearing from Goku that the mountain is provoked by women, Pilaf pushes Mai away. While Goku gathers snow and scares Pilaf, Chi Chi cleans up Octagon's house, but smashes many of her dishes. Chi Chi comes across the Bansho fan as she sweeps the yard, while Goku's snow is melting. Shu takes the fan but blows away his companions and flees.

Mara's owner is killed while illegally hunting a rhino, and the new manager Cedric Fatani seems even more intent on causing mayhem, as he diverts water from the shared spring, causing the death of many Leopards Den animals. A bitter inspector refuses to renew their permit to house wild animals; Sarah's difficult mother Caroline arrives; and a plane crashes nearby, exposing the family to the threat of deadly disease from a contraband chimpanzee. When Dup is nearly killed and Danny seriously injured in a lion attack, Danny's confidence is shattered, and Fatani takes advantage by trying to buy them out in a moment of weakness."

However, his cooperation turns to hostility when he thinks he's been betrayed. Sarah returns briefly to supply teaching at the local school. Tiger cubs go missing, and Rosie Trevanion gets engaged. The series ends with a spectacular drought- and wind-driven wildfire, which ruins Rosie's wedding day, and in the chaos Sarah dies trying to save the family's pet cheetah, Jana. Shocked and wracked with grief, it looks certain Danny will take Sarah's children back to their father in England \u2014 until they all agree they want to stay at Leopards Den, and the locals pitch in to help rebuild the fire-ravaged animal hospital."

A rabies outbreak threatens to decimate the wild animal population, and a new vet, Alice Collins, arrives at Leopards Den.

Liv and Fatani are struggling; nobody likes Rosie's fianc\u00e9 Dylan; and Dup receives a frightening medical prognosis. The family's cheetah Cassidy is poached, and tensions are high. Dup decides to use his remaining time to fix his ailing family by proving to Danny that his future son-in-law is worthy. As the wedding approaches, Danny, Dup, Rosie and Dylan set out on one last adventure, but Rosie is forced to fly them away from danger and it appears Dup has hatched his last disastrous plan. The saga of the Trevanion family concludes as Dup slips quietly away during Danny's wedding tribute. He climbs the rocky outcrop overlooking his beloved South African bush, where years earlier he made the decision to invite the Trevanions to live at Leopards Den. With tears of love Caroline explains, \"He'll always be here.\" Framed by the setting sun, Dup removes his hat and closes his eyes."

Yamcha realizes Chiaotzu is using his powers to paralyze Goku. Tien hits Goku dozens of times, nearly knocking him out. Goku gets up and kicks Tien in the face, but is frozen once more. Tien once again pounds Goku mercilessly. Realizing that he's winning too easily, Tien figures out that Chiaotzu is helping him and forces him to stop, wanting to beat Goku in a fair fight. Seeing the error in Shen's teachings, Tien refuses to kill Goku. Shen tells Chiaotzu to paralyze Tien, but he refuses. Shen tries to kill him, but Master Roshi hits him with a Kamehameha wave, blasting him out of the arena. Goku then attacks Tien with incredible force.

        "Goku's match is postponed by rain. While they're waiting for the weather to clear up, they relax in the bar. Giran, Goku's opponent, comes in and starts causing trouble. Yamcha warns Goku that Giran has been known to cheat. When the match finally starts, Giran tricks Goku into dropping his guard, then punches him. Goku responds with a furious attack and throws Giran out of the ring. Giran reveals that he can fly, and he lands safely back in bounds. He then spits rock-hard gum onto Goku, wraply trapping him. He throws Goku out of the ring, but Goku calls the flying Nimbus Cloud to save him. Just as Giran is about to punch Goku, his tail grows back and he dodges the punch. Since he is stronger with his tail, he is now able to break the gum. Shocked at this incredible display of strength, Giran forfeits the match."
