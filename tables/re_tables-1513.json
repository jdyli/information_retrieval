Her arrogance and unreasonable demands get the twins especially worked up; but knowing that the princess was merely putting on an act, Tamaki sets out to put things right. However, doing so forces him to confront his own feelings about Haruhi. As he broods over his troubles, Tamaki comes down with a cold, and the Host Club visits him at home, during which Tamaki has an urge to kiss Haruhi. After his father tells him it's normal to want to kiss your child, Tamaki kisses her on the forehead the next time he sees her.",

Kaoru tells Haruhi that he loves her, and kisses her cheek, but says that Hikaru is still more important to him. Haruhi does not understand that Kaoru loves her. Later, as Hikaru and Kaoru talk about their feelings for Haruhi, Hikaru realizes that Kaoru has done everything for him and tells him they can still stay together. They decide to become two different people, and shortly afterward, Hikaru dyes his hair. While in France on a class trip, Kyouya searches for Tamaki's mother. Tamaki, on the other hand, stays in Japan while letting the others believe he has gone. Haruhi eventually finds Tamaki sneaking around her house just as Kyouya calls to tell her Tamaki is with him, but has fallen sick. In France, Kyouya learns the location of Tamaki's mother. Meanwhile, Tamaki tells Haruhi about his past and his doubts about being in the Suou family. As he leaves, Tamaki kisses Haruhi on the forehead, causing her to blush. Back in France, Kyouya meets Tamaki's mother and learns about her past. He returns to Japan, soon afterward. Tamaki apologizes to the Host Club for lying about being in France. Kyouya mentions that he met a woman in France, eventually making Tamaki cry. Later that night, Haruhi feels weird but she believes that she just has a cold.",

        "62: Hikaru asks Haruhi to think about her feelings for him rather than give an answer straight away. He invites her to the Year End party and leaves. Haruhi is left surprised by his confession. Hikaru runs into the rest of the Host Club, including Tamaki who is relieved to see he is okay. Hikaru tells Tamaki that he confessed to Haruhi and hasn't got a reply, but he is going to fight for her. He tells Tamaki that he should also do his best and not give into his 'traumas'. Tamaki wonders what Hikaru means, and what Haruhi will reply to him. He wants the Host Club to stay a family forever. Later at the party, Haruhi tells Mei she was dense not to realise Hikaru's feelings and goes outside to speak to Hikaru privately. Outside, Haruhi tells Hikaru that she doesn't feel the same, but he's an important friend to her and hopes that won't change. Hikaru asks if she likes Tamaki. An embarrassed Haruhi admits she respects Tamaki, but says he's also annoying. Hikaru teases that he still has a chance with her then! Later on, Hikaru tells Tamaki that Haruhi rejected him. The Club make plans to visit a shrine together in the New Year, and Hikaru invites Haruhi to let her know they can still be friends. 63: Tamaki dreams of his father, who is kept apart from Tamaki and his mother. His father reassures him that family bonds can't be broken by distance. Tamaki wakes up and mentions that he wasn't invited to the New Year party at the main residence again and so it's unlikely that he will succeed his Grandmother, who is chairman of the Suoh business and lives at the main residence. He realises he's late to meet the others at the Asakusa temple. On meeting up, Hikaru notices that Tamaki is distracted and challenges him to a competition to buy something that Haruhi will love the most. They split up, but later on Tamaki runs into Haruhi. Tamaki mentions Hikaru, and Haruhi confesses that he hates herself for not realising his feelings sooner and questions how she can succeed as a lawyer if she's so dense. Tamaki reassures her and tells her to be more confident. He gives her an Ootoro Ring, which he bought earlier as part of Hikaru's challenge, which cheers her up. Seeing her happiness, Tamaki wonders what kind of love he feels for Haruhi and absent-mindedly touches her face - embarrassing them both. Tamaki explains to Haruhi that he's not really her father, and Haruhi calls him an idiot and says she never thought of him like a father. Embarrassed, she runs away and Tamaki chases after her. He finds her Ootoro Ring on the ground, but Haruhi has disappeared. 64: The Host Club realise that Haruhi has been kidnapped. They trace her mobile phone to find her location, and Kyoya works out that the kidnappers are people having business problems with the Suohs. Tamaki, Hikaru, Hunny and Mori reach the location and find Haruhi unharmed. Tamaki embraces her in relief. Hikaru makes sure to break up the embrace and express his concern too. Tamaki tells off the kidnappers, but also says he'll help them with their problems. Haruhi wants to return to Asakusa, and Tamaki realises it's because of the Ootoro Ring that she dropped and returns it to her. Hikaru gets a little jealous seeing how happy it makes her. Kousaka, the Suoh's lawyer who was loitering around the whole day, makes a call to Tamaki's grandmother and wants to discuss the issue of Tamaki moving into the main residence. 65: The Host Club are hosting a horse riding day. Tamaki has been acting distracted, and Hikaru wonders if Tamaki has realised his feelings for Haruhi yet. A new girl called Kanoya get into trouble with the horses and Tamaki protects her, but ends up hurt. Kanoya is grateful to Tamaki and thanks him by making him lunch, whilst he offers to show her around Tokyo. The others comment on how much Kanoya looks like Haruhi, except her personality is submissive instead. Tamaki and Kanoya start spending more time together. Kyouya reveals Kanoya has family problems like Tamaki and Hikaru comments that she is perfect for Tamaki and they have a lot in common - Tamaki overhears this. Later, Tamaki is with Kanoya when Haruhi walks by, dropping a book. Tamaki picks it up for her and comments on how different she is to him. Haruhi takes it as an insult and leaves, forgetting one of her books. Tamaki tries to return it to her, but Kanoya stops him by confessing her love to him. 66: The others are spying on Tamaki and Kanoya, and wondering what their relationship is. Hikaru tells Haruhi about the rumour Kanoya confessed to Tamaki . Haruhi wonders what his answer was, but Tamaki catches them spying before they can talk about it more. They join them for lunch, and Kanoya speaks to Tamaki in familiar terms, raising more questions about their relationship. Kyouya tells Tamaki to come with him to the clubroom and they leave. Kanoya reveals she feels good around Tamaki, and Haruhi wonders whether Tamaki likes Kanoya and knows that she's very different to herself. In the clubroom, Tamaki admits to Kyouya that he declined Kanoya, but realises that she is just like him. He thinks about his past and his longing for strong family bonds as a child. He reaffirms to himself in the present that he doesn't want to let go of his 'family' idea. The bell rings for class, and Kanoya goes to find Tamaki whilst Haruhi is told about her family problems. Whilst Tamaki is away, the Host Club decide they need a plan regarding Tamaki and Kanoya.",

        "67: The Host Club are holding an orienteering competition and Haruhi convinces Tamaki to enter with Kanoya. At 4 locations the participants have to complete a challenge and then choose from a selection of ingredients for the 5th challenge - to cook a curry. Tamaki chooses terrible ingredients, but Kanoya is too submissive to tell him he's wrong. During the challenge Tamaki realises that, although Kanoya is more suited to him and even resembles Haruhi, she has a very different personality and it's really Haruhi that he loves. 68: Tamaki reminisces on how stupidly he has acted towards Haruhi, particularly his insistence on treating her like a daughter. He remembers how his father's actions to choose love broke up his family and he's scared that he will do the same to his Host Club family. This reminds him of how Hikaru said that their bond won't be easily broken. Mori later also tells him to be honest with himself and know that everyone in the Host Club trusts him. At the curry challenge, Kanoya has a difficult task to make a curry out of terrible ingredients, but as a cook's daughter she gets back her confidence and does well. In the final 'truth' challenge Kanoya admits that she misses her dad and Haruhi encourages her to be honest with her family about her feelings. Haruhi also tells off Tamaki for keeping secrets from the Host Club and lets him know that they all want to support him \u2013 whatever it is! Tamaki realises that, despite being scared of losing his friends, he is ready to tell Haruhi how he feels. 69: In a flashback, Tamaki tells Hikaru that he also loves Haruhi. Walking to school, Haruhi is still wondering what Tamaki's secret is when he arrives on a Segway. He tries to confess but starts babbling nervously and makes Haruhi run away. Tamaki is full of self-confidence and thinks it's a sign she loves him. Hikaru tells Tamaki not to presume that he knows her feelings, but Tamaki of course doesn't listen! Meanwhile, Kanoya tells Haruhi that she was depending on Tamaki too much, and probably just liked him as a father figure. Haruhi disagrees because seeing them together made her jealous. Haruhi goes to the clubroom wondering what she sees in Tamaki \u2013 only to find him singing 'Happy Birthday' to himself like a fool. Tamaki's confidence evaporates on seeing Haruhi and he hides and starts to wonder whether he is right to assume she likes him. It is revealed that it's Haruhi's birthday next week and Tamaki and Hikaru both imagine buying her a present that will make her fall in love with them. Kyouya gets a phone call and reveals he knows something about the \"lying lawyer\" Kousaka. 70: Kyouya has found out that Kousaka has been secretly and regularly meeting with Tamaki's grandmother, and also has a link to Haruhi's family. Kousaka visits Haruhi's dad and it's revealed that she was classmates with Haruhi's mother. She warns Ranka that Haruhi should stay away from the Suoh family and Ouran. Meanwhile, Tamaki and Hikaru are trying to work out the perfect birthday present for Haruhi \u2013 finally agreeing that she'd like something low-cost and useful since she's a commoner. They end up both giving her the same thing - a Prawn Rice Water Flowing kit - but Haruhi prefers the Shiitake Mushroom kit from Ritsu. 71: It's the last day before Mori and Hunny graduate from Ouran, and the club are shocked to find out that they won't be together at university as Mori is pursing Law and Hunny pursuing Science and Technology. Haruhi finds Tamaki asleep in the clubroom and reflects on how badly she's treated him over the last few days and how hard he is taking the departure of Mori and Hunny. It's clear that something is on Mori's mind, and the Host Club think he's sad to be leaving Hunny's side. Hunny demands Mori tell him what's bothering him, and Mori says he will \u2013 after they duel.",
        "67: The Host Club are holding an orienteering competition and Haruhi convinces Tamaki to enter with Kanoya. At 4 locations the participants have to complete a challenge and then choose from a selection of ingredients for the 5th challenge - to cook a curry. Tamaki chooses terrible ingredients, but Kanoya is too submissive to tell him he's wrong. During the challenge Tamaki realises that, although Kanoya is more suited to him and even resembles Haruhi, she has a very different personality and it's really Haruhi that he loves. 68: Tamaki reminisces on how stupidly he has acted towards Haruhi, particularly his insistence on treating her like a daughter. He remembers how his father's actions to choose love broke up his family and he's scared that he will do the same to his Host Club family. This reminds him of how Hikaru said that their bond won't be easily broken. Mori later also tells him to be honest with himself and know that everyone in the Host Club trusts him. At the curry challenge, Kanoya has a difficult task to make a curry out of terrible ingredients, but as a cook's daughter she gets back her confidence and does well.

Tamaki realises that, despite being scared of losing his friends, he is ready to tell Haruhi how he feels. 69: In a flashback, Tamaki tells Hikaru that he also loves Haruhi. Walking to school, Haruhi is still wondering what Tamaki's secret is when he arrives on a Segway. He tries to confess but starts babbling nervously and makes Haruhi run away. Tamaki is full of self-confidence and thinks it's a sign she loves him. Hikaru tells Tamaki not to presume that he knows her feelings, but Tamaki of course doesn't listen! Meanwhile, Kanoya tells Haruhi that she was depending on Tamaki too much, and probably just liked him as a father figure. Haruhi disagrees because seeing them together made her jealous. Haruhi goes to the clubroom wondering what she sees in Tamaki \u2013 only to find him singing 'Happy Birthday' to himself like a fool.

        "72: Mori and Hunny fight, and Mori eventually wins by picking Hunny up and placing him out of bounds. Mori tells Hunny what's on his mind \u2013 that he doesn't want him to bring his soft toy with him to university as he's an adult now. The twins are shocked that this is all that was bothering Mori, but Hunny explains that they've known that they would have to go their separate ways eventually and would always remember the fun they had in the Host Club. Hunny and Mori graduate, but Hunny says they'll come back and visit \u2013 cheering Tamaki up. Tamaki wants to tell Haruhi the good news, and literally runs into her. They share an accidental kiss and both rush off a bit shaken by the moment. Meanwhile, Tamaki's grandmother declares that Tamaki will enter the main house and end the Host Club in the new school year. 73: Tamaki is still excited by the accidental kiss but doubts whether it meant anything to Haruhi. He is interrupted by someone that has come to see him from the main house. The lawyer Kousaka reveals she has convinced Tamaki's grandmother to let Tamaki enter the main house, and is hoping she'll get a big monetary reward from Tamaki's father. Tamaki visits Haruhi to tell her he's moving into the main house and so will be busy all holidays, but hopes to see her in the new school year. Haruhi is really happy for Tamaki. Kyouya also hears the news but has a bad feeling about it. Tamaki's grandmother says she'll be strictly supervising Tamaki. 74: Tamaki is told that he can't see his staff and pet dog from the 2nd house anymore. He'll also be expected to study all holidays. Tamaki's father greets him, and Tamaki begs to see his staff and dog, but he is told to obey his grandmother. Tamaki has to eat dinner alone, but resolves to make the best of his new situation because he'll still be able to see his friends in the new school year. School restarts, and Haruhi discovers that Tamaki can't join the Host Club as he has to study after school, his grandmother is ignoring him, and the staff at the main residence have been told not to speak to him. Tamaki remains optimistic that he'll be able to win over his grandmother and rejoin the Host Club, but admits he's lonely and wants to have lunch with everyone. Unfortunately, with the Host Club suspended, all the Host Club guests also want time with Tamaki and he gets taken away. Separately, Haruhi and Tamaki are both longing to speak to each other again. The chapter ends with Tamaki confirming to his grandmother that he'll leave the Host Club as she wishes. 75: Tamaki announces he's quitting the Host Club and tells Haruhi that she should also quit because he will pay off her remaining debt. Haruhi is furious and asks Tamaki to explain, but Tamaki tells her it's none of her business and leaves. Kyouya follows and finds Tamaki upset. Tamaki explains that his grandmother accused him of ruining Haruhi's life by forcing her into the Club and making her lie about her gender, and he has damaged the Suoh reputation by associating with a person from a lower social standing. He agrees to leave the Host Club when she threatens to get Haruhi expelled from Ouran. Kyouya thinks his grandmother will still target Haruhi despite Tamaki's actions. Haruhi goes to demand answers from Tamaki's grandmother, but Tamaki and Kyoya find out and interrupt her. Tamaki tells her to go back to school and stop causing trouble. Haruhi is shocked by his words and remembers back to when Tamaki said he would take care of her. The Host Club gets permanently suspended from Ouran by Tamaki's father.",

Meanwhile, Tamaki's grandmother declares that Tamaki will enter the main house and end the Host Club in the new school year. 73: Tamaki is still excited by the accidental kiss but doubts whether it meant anything to Haruhi. He is interrupted by someone that has come to see him from the main house. The lawyer Kousaka reveals she has convinced Tamaki's grandmother to let Tamaki enter the main house, and is hoping she'll get a big monetary reward from Tamaki's father. Tamaki visits Haruhi to tell her he's moving into the main house and so will be busy all holidays, but hopes to see her in the new school year. Haruhi is really happy for Tamaki. Kyouya also hears the news but has a bad feeling about it. Tamaki's grandmother says she'll be strictly supervising Tamaki. 74: Tamaki is told that he can't see his staff and pet dog from the 2nd house anymore. He'll also be expected to study all holidays. Tamaki's father greets him, and Tamaki begs to see his staff and dog, but he is told to obey his grandmother. Tamaki has to eat dinner alone, but resolves to make the best of his new situation because he'll still be able to see his friends in the new school year. School restarts, and Haruhi discovers that Tamaki can't join the Host Club as he has to study after school, his grandmother is ignoring him, and the staff at the main residence have been told not to speak to him. Tamaki remains optimistic that he'll be able to win over his grandmother and rejoin the Host Club, but admits he's lonely and wants to have lunch with everyone. Unfortunately, with the Host Club suspended, all the Host Club guests also want time with Tamaki and he gets taken away. Separately, Haruhi and Tamaki are both longing to speak to each other again. The chapter ends with Tamaki confirming to his grandmother that he'll leave the Host Club as she wishes. 75: Tamaki announces he's quitting the Host Club and tells Haruhi that she should also quit because he will pay off her remaining debt. Haruhi is furious and asks Tamaki to explain, but Tamaki tells her it's none of her business and leaves. Kyouya follows and finds Tamaki upset. Tamaki explains that his grandmother accused him of ruining Haruhi's life by forcing her into the Club and making her lie about her gender, and he has damaged the Suoh reputation by associating with a person from a lower social standing. He agrees to leave the Host Club when she threatens to get Haruhi expelled from Ouran. Kyouya thinks his grandmother will still target Haruhi despite Tamaki's actions. Haruhi goes to demand answers from Tamaki's grandmother, but Tamaki and Kyoya find out and interrupt her. Tamaki tells her to go back to school and stop causing trouble. Haruhi is shocked by his words and remembers back to when Tamaki said he would take care of her. The Host Club gets permanently suspended from Ouran by Tamaki's father."

        "76: Tamaki tells his grandmother that he has quit the Host Club and she is pleased. The Host Club are angry and don't understand why Tamaki is going along with it. Haruhi runs into Kousaka, and Kousaka thinks Tamaki lives in a different world and has chosen family over the Host Club. Haruhi doesn't believe Tamaki would ever betray the Club and thinks something else must be going on. She decides to return to school dressed shabbily. She tells Tamaki that she knows he wants to bond with his grandmother and has returned to how she used to be before joining the Host Club so that he can do so without worrying about her.

At school, Haruhi and Tamaki no longer speak and she is continuing to dress shabby. She tells Mei that she'll continue until Tamaki reconciles with his family. Kyouya calls a meeting and tells everyone that Tamaki's mum has SLE syndrome, but thinks she may be taking an experimental drug to get better. They later discover that Kyouya's family have made a valuable deal with a company led by Tamaki's father to exclusively sell the drug, which will give Tamaki's father a chance to gain independence from Tamaki's grandmother. Unfortunately this deal shatters Tamaki's dream of having a happy family. 78: Side story about the Hitachiin family. 79: Haruhi dreams of confessing to Tamaki.

At the main house, Tamaki is bonding with his grandmother and she compliments his knowledge of the things she likes. He tells her he learnt it all from his father, and he must have been trying to share her loves with Tamaki, which surprises her.

        "80: The Host Club have devised a plan to reunite Tamaki with his mother. With Mori's help, Haruhi breaks through a window in the main house and comes face to face with Tamaki and his grandmother. Tamaki admits he knows his mother is leaving Tokyo, but refuses to see her as he already has plans with his grandmother. Haruhi gets angry and asks him not to put aside his own feelings for the sake of his family. Tamaki still refuses, but his grandmother \u2013 who now seems to think more favourably about Tamaki - gives her blessing for him to go. With the help of several of Tamaki's friends from the Host Club and school, he is able to reach the airport on time and reunite with his mother. Haruhi finally tells Tamaki that she loves him. 81: Still at the airport, Tamaki is in pieces over Haruhi's confession and Haruhi starts to have second thoughts \u2013 finally giving Tamaki the courage to kiss her and convince her of his feelings! Tamaki's father and grandmother decide to take Haruhi's advice and speak honestly to each other to reconcile their differences. Back at school, Tamaki returns and the Host Club reopens. The twins don't think Haruhi and Tamaki have been acting like a couple, and we discover this is because Tamaki has been too busy trying to plan their first date. Meanwhile, Haruhi meets up with Kousaka to get some career advice. Later on Tamaki and Haruhi meet up and Haruhi asks Tamaki to go to the Amusement Park with her before he has the chance to ask her out on his carefully planned 'perfect date'. Haruhi finds his 'perfect date' notes, and finds it funny. She reassures him that she could never be bored as long as she's spending time with him. Tamaki tells Haruhi he loves her and she gets really flustered by his cuddles and loving stares. 82: Tamaki and Haruhi meet for their first date. Tamaki typically goes overboard, but the rest of the Host Club try to fix all his mistakes before Haruhi notices and dumps him. They also intervene when the Zuka club see Haruhi and try to steal her away. Tamaki and Haruhi escape and Tamaki takes her to visit her mother's grave so that he can pay his respects. Tamaki admits that he knows Haruhi has been offered a 1 year scholarship in the USA, as she is one of Ouran's best students, and he agrees it will be a good experience for her. After hearing Tamaki's supportive words, Haruhi is convinced her decision to accept the offer is the right one - even though it means leaving a lot behind. 83: The Host Club arrange a farewell party for Haruhi. At the party, Haruhi is surprised that Tamaki isn't paying her much attention considering tonight is their last together, but before she can think about it too much she is whisked away and given a make-over so that she can reveal the truth about her gender to everyone. She enters dressed as a girl \u2013 but everyone says they already knew Haruhi's secret. Tamaki and Haruhi dance together as a public couple. Later, Haruhi and Tamaki talk alone and Haruhi says she's sad to be leaving. When Tamaki shows her the plans to their new apartment, she realises that Tamaki is coming with her to the USA! Haruhi can't believe his extravagance, but Tamaki declares that he has no intention of leaving her side and they kiss. In the USA, Tamaki and Haruhi are settling into their new apartment \u2013 only to find their new neighbours are none other than the rest of the Host Club! Haruhi realises that they will all be together for a little longer after all.",

At the party, Haruhi is surprised that Tamaki isn't paying her much attention considering tonight is their last together, but before she can think about it too much she is whisked away and given a make-over so that she can reveal the truth about her gender to everyone. She enters dressed as a girl \u2013 but everyone says they already knew Haruhi's secret. Tamaki and Haruhi dance together as a public couple. Later, Haruhi and Tamaki talk alone and Haruhi says she's sad to be leaving. When Tamaki shows her the plans to their new apartment, she realises that Tamaki is coming with her to the USA! Haruhi can't believe his extravagance, but Tamaki declares that he has no intention of leaving her side and they kiss. In the USA, Tamaki and Haruhi are settling into their new apartment \u2013 only to find their new neighbours are none other than the rest of the Host Club! Haruhi realises that they will all be together for a little longer after all."

Thirty years in the future, the family's appearance may have changed somewhat but their love/hate relationships are still very much alive. Ben is in now in his eighties, a little slower than he used to be but still as grumpy as ever and causing grief for Susan \u2013 who, thanks to \"a little moisturiser\", hasn't aged a bit (\"a little moisturiser\" may also be an injoke to her guest appearance in Doctor Who). To say that Janey has gained a little weight is an understatement, as she now weighs in at a whopping 20 stone. Michael, meanwhile, is doing a very bad job of hiding his baldness with an unconvincing wig and, following a disastrous trip to the zoo, Roger is now merely a head in a glass dome. Susan is put out by the fact that grandson Kenzo, now 38 years old, hasn't come to visit the family for Christmas Day. Ben is quick to point out that the Harpers have had some of the worst Christmases ever, and the family are reminded of some of their Christmas disasters. Two years stand out in particular \u2013 back when they were all a lot younger, and Janey was a lot lighter, the usual arguments over presents were exacerbated by Susan's fun, new game \u2013 the Greed Gift Exchange. But, when Kenzo finally arrives, he points out that the year Uncle Richard came to stay was just as traumatic for him.",

        "The Harpers are at Grace's funeral, and while Janey is concerned for her mother, Michael seems more interested in the backside of a young undertaker, Sean. Needing some time alone with her mother, Susan's grief soon turns into shock when her father, Arthur, suddenly turns up out of the blue very much alive. Susan's angry at his sudden re-appearance. After chatting with Ben, Arthur is surprised that Susan even married him in the first place, so he offers her \u00a32 million to divorce him for good. Ben and Susan agree to the divorce, and decide they'll get married again after they receive the money. The following day, the two of them go to see a lawyer about getting divorced, but first they have to come up with a reason, and they're surprisingly imaginative. Michael's nerves get the better of him when he tells Sean that he is dying, just so he can spend some more time with him. After coming home from the lawyer they are shocked to discover that Arthur had died on the sofa while they were gone, and it seems that Arthur was lying all along and that he didn't actually have the money. Susan is disgusted with herself for even thinking about getting divorced for money. The following day, Michael finally plucks the courage to tell Sean that he isn't actually dying, but he may regret telling the truth.",

Ben decides that enough is enough and invites the local Vicar around to cheer her up and it finally does the job, getting her off the sofa and desperately wanting Ben to apply some 'Cavitox', however Ben is not too keen to apply it. How can it possibly go wrong?"

Meanwhile, Janey takes care of an annoying elderly patient, which eventually leads to him dying and leaving Janey his flat, and Michael's boyfriend Scott moves into the Harper residence."

        "It's Susan's Godparents anniversary, and Ben doesn\u2019t want to go. Susan's determined to make him, but he point blank refuses\u2026 which sparks one of many, many arguments. After their old one collapses, they go to get a new bed, which they argue over, until they find separate beds, which turns into separate rooms, which eventually turns into separate houses. Susan stays at her house, while Ben seeks solace in Roger, who's expecting a woman around. And while Susan is enjoying herself with lots of happy company, Ben is ruining Roger's evening with a woman. The following night, it's Susan's turn to find accommodation elsewhere, and she ends up in Michael and Scott's flat, where, as usual, she tries to take control of things. Ben then intrudes on Roger the following evening\u2026 mainly because he\u2019s hungry, but Michael and Janey come around, begging him to apologise to Susan... they can't stand having their separate parents in each others' flats.
