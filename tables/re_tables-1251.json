Diversified livelihood generation assistance to the community has played some encouraging role to reduce the dependency of local community upon biodiversity resources and indirectly contributing towards their conservation. The strength of Aaranyak lies in integrating research and community-based activities into a coherent programme that generates knowledge and fosters innovation at local and regional level to achieve the true meaning of sustainable development in terms of biodiversity conservation."

Aaranyak has for the first time in North East India, started the legal orientation programme for the forest officials working in the Wildlife Sanctuaries and National Parks in Assam in 1996. Since then, covering almost all the protected areas of Assam, Aaranyak has organised more than 12 legal orientation programmes. Advocate Gautom Uzir of Gauhati High Court is the Chief Legal Advisor of Aaranyak, he is in-charge of conducting the legal orientation camps for the benefit of forest staffs in Assam.

Endowed with a sub (extra) tropical type of monsoonal climate, the region shows remarkable variability of weather and climate on a regional scale and forms a distinct climatic zone within the Indian landmass. Consisting mainly of the basins if three of the large river systems of the world viz. the Brahmaputra, the Barak (Meghna) and the Irrawady, the NER possesses the richest treasure-trove of water resources in India. It possesses about 30% of the total water resources potential and about 41% of the total hydropower potential of India. The per capita and per hectare availability of water in this region is the highest in the country. The NE India is one of the wettest as well as most acutely flood prone zones of the world."

Since then the programme has been continuously managing and integrating spatial and non-spatial data that are related with mainly biodiversity characteristics of North East India. Till now the unit has prepared different thematic maps of Assam in particular and other North Eastern States as a whole. Under this initiative effort is on towards creating a complete GIS database of the protected areas of Assam and North East India. In this regard, the unit has already developed GIS database for several reserved forests, wildlife sanctuaries and National Parks of Assam."

There has always been a paucity of exploration and research on wildlife in North East India, which encompasses an important part of the Indo-Myanmar biodiversity hotspot, one of the 25 global biodiversity hotspots recognized by the international community. Molecular genetic tools provide ample opportunities for studying different aspects of population biology for species which are hard to observe directly through visual observation in the impregnable forests of North East India."

Nora moves in with Josh, Aidan, and Sally, and while unable to see her, convinces Sally to attend her high school reunion. As the full moon approaches, Nora starts asking Josh things about what he goes through, fearing that she too is now a werewolf. Sally attends her reunion, meeting with her high school friend Stevie Adkins who committed suicide their junior year, and Diane Alcott, the vapid prom queen who died on a missionary trip in Africa. When Diane ignores Stevie, even in death, Sally confronts her, leading to Diane having a revelation and her Door appearing to send her to the other side. Upset as she missed her Door, Stevie consoles her by telling her that she can still dream in death. When she is alone that night, she sleeps and has a dream where she sees her door. When she opens it, she is attacked by some unknown dark force, causing her to abruptly wake up and find herself floating several feet in the air. Aidan appears before the council of vampires at the Halloway Hotel and Mother who decides that Bishop's \"orphans\" are to be culled and Aidan will be the second-in-command to her own daughter who will control Boston. She also adds that if Aidan is successful in grooming her daughter, he will be free of the council. That night, Nora drops Josh off in the woods so he can transform, and when she begins to hear his transformation, she is relieved that she has not been infected until she doubles over in pain and begins to transform, as well.

When she opens it, she is attacked by some unknown dark force, causing her to abruptly wake up and find herself floating several feet in the air. Aidan appears before the council of vampires at the Halloway Hotel and Mother who decides that Bishop's \"orphans\" are to be culled and Aidan will be the second-in-command to her own daughter who will control Boston. She also adds that if Aidan is successful in grooming her daughter, he will be free of the council. That night, Nora drops Josh off in the woods so he can transform, and when she begins to hear his transformation, she is relieved that she has not been infected until she doubles over in pain and begins to transform, as well. As she is trapped in the car and calling out to him, Josh is shot at by Heggeman who has been tasked by Mother to kill him to remove any distractions to keep Aidan focused on her daughter. As Heggeman lifts the gun to shoot Josh again, the screen cuts to black, and a shot is heard."

        "Josh looks at Heggeman who has him in his sights when Nora, fully transformed, attacks Heggeman and kills him. Aidan digs up Suren, Mother's daughter, and brings her to the Halloway Hotel so she can feed on willing people so she may regain her strength. Sally, horrified at the actual sensation she had in her nightmare, seeks solace with Stevie and his friends Dylan and \"Boner\", who Josh and Nora meet when they get home. Josh reveals to Aidan that Nora has killed Heggeman. Nora tries to clear her head as Sally reveals to Stevie she physically felt something when she opened the Door in her dream. Aidan attempts to help Suren take her place as Boston's head vampire by suggesting that they install a new vampire police officer as their assistant, but she has other plans, having chosen the still human police officer Cecilia to pick a new subject rather than one of Bishop's sires. Suren tries to get Aidan to turn her, but he refuses. Josh tries to console Nora at work when he is reminded that he has to attend the first-year med student mixer. Josh later manages to convince her to go, where she gets drunk to take solace in the fact that she is now a werewolf and that she has miscarried her and Josh's child. Dylan convinces Sally to go to a party to \"Rage\", where Sally discovers that ghosts can take over living people's bodies if they are willing or in a weaker state of mind. Sally relishes the fact that she can eat, drink, and feel things, again, until Dylan tries to make a move on her in their stolen bodies. Sally refuses and Stevie pulls them out of their bodies to help her, before causing Dylan to disintegrate entirely. Josh decides to drop out of medical school, and try to find a cure for his and Nora's condition instead. Aidan discovers Suren has turned Cecilia, and she tells him he will do everything to make her the best so he can be free of Mother. Sally fears that she now knows that ghosts can permanently destroy each other, but Nora convinces her that it is better to know what one is capable of, with her remembering that she did kill Heggeman as the wolf.",

        "When Josh rents storage rooms for himself and Nora to safely \"wolf out\" in, Nora is far from thrilled. While they argue over it, with Nora revealing she remembers killing Heggeman, Sally, watching from a few feet away, is distracted by a dark, shadowy figure lurking in the distance before it vanishes suddenly. Meanwhile, Aidan and Julia enjoy a lovely morning together, except for the fact that Aidan almost bites her, instead taking out his urges with a blood pack. At the hospital, Josh and Sally confront Aidan about his whereabouts, and he finally admits to seeing someone he likes. Josh expresses concern but Aidan convinces him that he is fine as long as he has plenty of bagged blood to drink\u2014which might become a problem since the hospital has started locking up their blood supplies. The nursery catches Sally's attention and she accidentally discovers nurse Zoe Gonzales, a human who can not only see and talk to ghosts but also helps them merge with babies to be reincarnated. Later that night, Josh and Aidan enjoy a brief if awkward moment of male bonding about sexual conquest but the good feelings are short lived. The next morning, they discover that the woman Aidan is seeing is Josh's former fianc\u00e9. After a painful reunion (of sorts) between Josh and Julia, tensions are high all around. Josh is angry with Aidan, who likes Julia but can no longer act on it, Nora is angry with Josh and jealous of Julia, and Julia hates Josh for leaving her. Later, Aidan approaches Julia and breaks off the relationship, both because of tensions with Josh and his inability to stop himself from feeding on her. When Sally sees Zoe helping a ghost merge with a newborn baby to become reincarnated, she makes it her goal to become reincarnated, too. After having a heart to heart with Zoe, Sally convinces her to come to the house and interview her \"roommates\" Aidan and Josh. Aidan and Josh pretend to be humans who can see ghosts and try to give Zoe a good impression of Sally, but Zoe passes on reincarnating her when they reveal Sally nearly killed Danny. Sally tries to jump into a baby herself, but has to stop when the dark spirit that has been following her around attacks her. She realizes that if she does jump into a baby, the spirit will kill her. Thankfully, Zoe offers Sally help in fending off the evil spirit. Without access to the hospital's blood bank, Aidan is falling deeper and deeper into despair and sickness. He cannot stop sweating, he is weak, pale and, most of all, he is hungry. Finally, he gives in and goes to a woman who lets vampires feed off her for money and he drinks his fill. Josh and Sally are not sure that Nora is going to show up for their full moon lockdown, and they are almost right. Nora spends her day stalking Julia with the intention of hurting her. Realizing she is a danger to others, Nora shows up for Sally to lock both she and Josh up before the full moon. After a few minutes, Josh and Nora's wolf forms dent the storage rooms' doors.",

The next morning, they discover that the woman Aidan is seeing is Josh's former fianc\u00e9. After a painful reunion (of sorts) between Josh and Julia, tensions are high all around. Josh is angry with Aidan, who likes Julia but can no longer act on it, Nora is angry with Josh and jealous of Julia, and Julia hates Josh for leaving her. Later, Aidan approaches Julia and breaks off the relationship, both because of tensions with Josh and his inability to stop himself from feeding on her.

After having a heart to heart with Zoe, Sally convinces her to come to the house and interview her \"roommates\" Aidan and Josh. Aidan and Josh pretend to be humans who can see ghosts and try to give Zoe a good impression of Sally, but Zoe passes on reincarnating her when they reveal Sally nearly killed Danny. Sally tries to jump into a baby herself, but has to stop when the dark spirit that has been following her around attacks her. She realizes that if she does jump into a baby, the spirit will kill her. Thankfully, Zoe offers Sally help in fending off the evil spirit. Without access to the hospital's blood bank, Aidan is falling deeper and deeper into despair and sickness.

While they argue over it, with Nora revealing she remembers killing Heggeman, Sally, watching from a few feet away, is distracted by a dark, shadowy figure lurking in the distance before it vanishes suddenly.

        "Aidan approaches the old woman he has been paying for her blood, but she says she can no longer give any blood but offers her daughter instead for him later. At the hospital, Josh is approached by Brynn, another werewolf, who needs him to break her twin brother Connor out before the next full moon. Sally tries to help Zoe flirt with the new surgeon, Dr. Tim Forrest, to no avail, and Zoe invites her to come to the support group she holds for ghosts. Aidan goes back to drink from the old woman's daughter, but when he discovers that she is a young child, he is revolted and runs off. He is called in by Suren to consult with a proposed addition to their group: a local mobster. Aidan believes he will not be an asset, despite Suren's insistence after the mobster brings them one of Bishop's orphans. Josh is approached by Brynn and Connor who take him out to a club, revealing that they are purebred werewolves, rather than having been turned. When Josh mentions he is seeking out a cure, it piques Connor's interest, and later when he mentions he is trying to find the biological switch that initiates the transformation to turn it off, Connor and Brynn reveal that they want to become the wolf permanently. Josh is appalled at their wishes, but with their funding he may be able to solve the problem, and asks Nora to come meet them. At Zoe's support group, Sally meets up again with Nick, at which Zoe is surprised that they know each other. After accepting what seems like a date, she talks with Zoe the following day who reveals that she is seeing Nick intimately. Nick later confirms this, and his newfound ability to avoid reliving his death day after day after meeting Zoe, which leaves Sally heartbroken. Later, while idly watching Dr. Forrest and his girlfriend Janet being intimate, Sally takes the opportunity to possess Janet so she can feel a loving embrace. While mulling over the mobster's inclusion as a vampire, Aidan has flashbacks to 1930 when his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Henry started to want more out of his immortal life, specifically what Suren would give them. When Aidan turned down Suren's advances, Henry took up the offer and became Suren's lover. In the present, he tells Suren that he has made up his mind and will turn the mobster. As he begins drinking the mobster's blood, he has another flashback before he starts draining the mobster dry. He proclaims that this time he will have Suren, who begins feeding on the mobster before the two vampires make love to each other.",

        "Aidan begins to fall into bad habits as his affair with Suren gets deeper, including feeding on live blood. Their affair does not go unnoticed by Mother, who has them go after the orphans. Flashbacks to 1930 continue, with Aidan having become angered at Henry for having affairs with other women under Suren's nose. When Suren finally discovered Henry with another woman, the emotional distress led her to attack the woman in the hotel's crowded ballroom, forcing Mother to call on all of the vampires to lock down the room and kill all of the human occupants. This also led to Suren being \"grounded\" for the next 80 years, and Aidan warned Henry that he should not come back to Boston ever again. In the present, Sally continues to use Janet's body to enjoy the sensations of life and sex with Dr. Forrest. However, when this comes to the attention of Josh and Aidan, they warn her she should stop. She agrees, but the pull is too strong and the next time she possesses Janet she gets stuck. She seeks out Josh's help at the hospital in Janet's body, but Dr. Forrest's arrival waylays her plans. He brings her home so she can meet his mother, but the shadow entity appears before Sally, and as she yells at it, it rushes at her and removes her from Janet's body. Later, Janet comes to the gang's house, having had a part of Sally's memories stuck in her after the ordeal. When Sally goes to try to apologize with her, she finds Janet drawing the shadowy figure fervishly, until she writes down the name \"Reaper\" on one of the drawings. Elsewhere, Josh has been sharing his plans to find the cure with Connor, Brynn, and an irritated Nora. Nora's condition is only made worse when her abusive ex-boyfriend Will has come to town. With the full moon approaching, Connor manages to convince Josh to retaliate against Will for what he did to Nora. However, Brynn talks to Nora first, knowing that she is not willing to be cured. Nora reveals that she has been stalking Will ever since he came into town, and has been waiting for the full moon to come to exact her own revenge. That night, three werewolves viciously attack Will, devouring him. Josh wakes up in the warehouse alone, while Nora wakes up satiated in the woods with Brynn and Connor.",

While Sally tries to get Josh to make her father comfortable, and make sure that her mother does not spend the afterlife in a hospital gown, Josh crosses paths with two detectives who inform him that Will has been found dead and they are looking for Nora. Elsewhere, Aidan hunts down the orphan's vampire dens to find Henry, but has no luck, so he instead takes out his energy by drinking blood. However, he gets so drunk on the blood that he begins to see visions of Bishop, who advises Aidan to hunt down Henry and kill him.

        "Josh and Nora awake nude in the woods after a full moon, unsure of the events the night before. In a flashback to 24 hours earlier, Aidan and Josh are preparing to leave for work when they realize that strange things are happening, and believe Sally is losing control of her abilities, but she claims it is not her but some poltergeist come to bother her. At the hospital, Josh finds Nora who is still conflicted over what happened. Josh reveals she hurt him by leaving without any answer, and mentions that the twins said they were in contact with her, which they were not. Elsewhere in the hospital, Aidan is approached by Atlee of the Dutch who believes Aidan knows something about Heggeman's disappearance. Back at the house, Sally continues to see the effects of the poltergeist, and when she ascends the stairs, it attacks her, with the threatening voice of Danny. She goes to see Aidan at the hospital, wondering if Danny is somehow behind the Reaper's appearance, but they soon discover that Danny was murdered in prison. Aidan tells her to use iron to disperse Danny's essence and assures her that she is the stronger ghost, if he is truly the Reaper, and then confronts Josh about Cecilia's sudden disappearance. Josh reveals that Cecilia did help him, and in exchange he told her that the twins killed Heggeman. When he finally gets Cecilia's phone to pick up, Connor is on the other line, revealing that they have captured Cecilia and want to have a showdown with Aidan in the woods that night: a full moon. Aidan tells Atlee that he knows the where the purebred wolves who killed Heggeman are and have him come along to save Cecilia and get revenge. Elsewhere, Nora and Josh have a fight, as Nora (and the twins) believe Cecilia was sent by Aidan to kill the twins, and she goes to the woods to change with the twins. At the house, Sally has her showdown with Danny, who reveals his ghostly form. While Sally believes she has the upper hand, Danny's death in prison has taught him more in a short period of time and overpowers her until the Reaper appears to kill Danny's spirit, before taking on a more corporeal form.

        "Josh and Nora awake nude in the woods after a full moon, unsure of the events the night before. In a flashback to 24 hours earlier, Aidan and Josh are preparing to leave for work when they realize that strange things are happening, and believe Sally is losing control of her abilities, but she claims it is not her but some poltergeist come to bother her. At the hospital, Josh finds Nora who is still conflicted over what happened. Josh reveals she hurt him by leaving without any answer, and mentions that the twins said they were in contact with her, which they were not.

        "It has been a week since the events of the full moon. Sally is on edge as the Reaper has not sought her out to \"shred\" her, but he appears to her to give her an ultimatum as he has found a loophole. Sally can either be reaped or become the new Reaper. Josh has been out of work for the past week, in a slump since the breakup with Nora. Aidan, however, has called in Emily to cheer Josh up. When Sally asks Aidan for advice on the Reaper, he suggests she shred him before he gets the chance to shred her. Emily plans Josh's recovery from the breakup, saying that the two of them should go out drinking. Sally goes to see Stevie to ask his advice on how to shred ghosts, but he warns her that shredding makes ghosts dark and it is not something she wants to do. Aidan meets with Suren who is upset that Cecilia has been killed. Suren also reveals that Mother will be making a trip to Boston to check on her progress, but she has lied to her and said that Bishop's orphans have been culled so they must take care of them. Aidan hunts down Henry to warn him, finding him at the house of a human who offers passage across the threshold in exchange for money. Aidan tells Henry to gather all of the orphans at the house because he has found a way to save them and Henry. Josh leaves work early, as the hospital reminds him too much of Nora, and catches up with Emily at the bar where he finds she has been hanging out with Julia. Still not ready to face his ex-fianc\u00e9e, Josh orders drinks, which is out of character for him. As the night goes on, Sally ultimately faces the Reaper, managing to shred him before he can do the same to her. However, the Reaper quickly reforms his spiritual form, surprised that Sally had the gall to attack him, but also instilling the exhilaration in her of being a Reaper. Realizing she has no way out, she takes on his offer to be a Reaper and he takes her out on her first assignment. Elsewhere, the orphans gather at Henry's beckoning where Aidan promises them that they will have safe passage to Baltimore, where the vampire society has no hold. However, the owner of the house is brought in front of Suren who offers to buy the house from him for a large sum of money. He agrees, and her living lawyer takes ownership of the house. Aidan and Henry quickly trap the orphans in the basement and escape the house as the lawyer uninvites the vampires from his new house, causing the orphans to turn to ash. Henry is upset, but Aidan reminds him that this is the only way to end his exile. At the bar, Julia throws insults at Josh, feeling somehow relieved at his worse situation, until Emily needs to be taken home as she has drunk too much and hit on a straight girl. At Julia's apartment, after they put Emily to bed, Julia realizes she has come to Boston to find Josh and to find answers. Josh tells her as much of the truth as possible (without revealing his transformation into a werewolf), saying he did not want to hurt her, and leaves the apartment to head back home. The Reaper takes Sally to Stevie, saying that he has been shredding too many ghosts and is stalking his former bully to shred him once he dies and that he must be reaped. Sally, upset that she will have to reap her best friend, tries to talk to Stevie to find a way out of him being reaped, but when he admits he will shred his former bully, Sally realizes she cannot help him and the Reaper shreds him. Aidan presents Henry to Suren, who is ready to take out revenge for what he did 80 years prior by flaying him alive. Aidan tells Henry this is the only way he can re-enter vampire society and leaves him in Suren's hands. The next day, Aidan sees that Sally is still on this plane of existence, and Josh sees Emily off, but not before she tells him he missed his chance to have angry and drunk make-up sex with Julia.",

Emily plans Josh's recovery from the breakup, saying that the two of them should go out drinking. Sally goes to see Stevie to ask his advice on how to shred ghosts, but he warns her that shredding makes ghosts dark and it is not something she wants to do. Aidan meets with Suren who is upset that Cecilia has been killed. Suren also reveals that Mother will be making a trip to Boston to check on her progress, but she has lied to her and said that Bishop's orphans have been culled so they must take care of them. Aidan hunts down Henry to warn him, finding him at the house of a human who offers passage across the threshold in exchange for money. Aidan tells Henry to gather all of the orphans at the house because he has found a way to save them and Henry. Josh leaves work early, as the hospital reminds him too much of Nora, and catches up with Emily at the bar where he finds she has been hanging out with Julia. Still not ready to face his ex-fianc\u00e9e, Josh orders drinks, which is out of character for him. As the night goes on, Sally ultimately faces the Reaper, managing to shred him before he can do the same to her. However, the Reaper quickly reforms his spiritual form, surprised that Sally had the gall to attack him, but also instilling the exhilaration in her of being a Reaper. Realizing she has no way out, she takes on his offer to be a Reaper and he takes her out on her first assignment. Elsewhere, the orphans gather at Henry's beckoning where Aidan promises them that they will have safe passage to Baltimore, where the vampire society has no hold. However, the owner of the house is brought in front of Suren who offers to buy the house from him for a large sum of money. He agrees, and her living lawyer takes ownership of the house. Aidan and Henry quickly trap the orphans in the basement and escape the house as the lawyer uninvites the vampires from his new house, causing the orphans to turn to ash. Henry is upset, but Aidan reminds him that this is the only way to end his exile. At the bar, Julia throws insults at Josh, feeling somehow relieved at his worse situation, until Emily needs to be taken home as she has drunk too much and hit on a straight girl. At Julia's apartment, after they put Emily to bed, Julia realizes she has come to Boston to find Josh and to find answers. Josh tells her as much of the truth as possible (without revealing his transformation into a werewolf), saying he did not want to hurt her, and leaves the apartment to head back home. The Reaper takes Sally to Stevie, saying that he has been shredding too many ghosts and is stalking his former bully to shred him once he dies and that he must be reaped. Sally, upset that she will have to reap her best friend, tries to talk to Stevie to find a way out of him being reaped, but when he admits he will shred his former bully, Sally realizes she cannot help him and the Reaper shreds him. Aidan presents Henry to Suren, who is ready to take out revenge for what he did 80 years prior by flaying him alive. Aidan tells Henry this is the only way he can re-enter vampire society and leaves him in Suren's hands.

        "Aidan and Josh try to figure out what to do with Sally, who has fallen into a catatonic state since the \"Reaper\" took over. As Aidan has never encountered something like this in the past, they decide to seek out Zoe's help, even though Sally has just shredded Nick. Zoe is reluctant at first, as she watched Sally shred all of her ghosts, but Aidan pleads with her to help and she agrees. Upon learning the full story, she realizes that Sally's subconscious has created the Reaper as a form of feeling guilty for passing up her door, and this entity has taken hold of Sally. Inside Sally's mind, she is living out a fantasy where she is still alive and she is living in the house with her fianc\u00e9 \"Scott\", the Reaper personality. As Sally is preparing breakfast, she sees Josh's reflection in a microwave, but she cannot remember him. Meanwhile, Scott is continuously pushing her that they should move out of the house, an attempt to make sure his personality will overwrite Sally's. Aidan and Josh's attempts to contact Sally while she is out cold anger \"Scott\", deciding to trap them all in the house, and once he puts Sally in bed in her mind, making her think she is ill, she takes control of Sally's ghostly body. He first taunts them, bringing up Aidan's murders and Josh's breakup with Nora, before revealing to Zoe that Nick has been shredded. Aidan is beginning to feel the effects of live blood withdrawal, and Zoe is tempting him, and it is also the night of the full moon. If Sally is not saved, Zoe will be killed by one of the housemates. The two try to push Zoe to save Sally, even if they are all trapped together, but her insistence that she will not help forces the two to reveal their supernatural natures. Zoe attempts a \"mind meld\" with Sally, hoping that by contacting Sally's mind she will be able to free herself. As their consciousnesses merge, Zoe falls limp. She finds herself at Sally and \"Scott's\" engagement party, where she does her best to convince Sally that she is living in a fantasy and that \"Scott\" is not who he seems. To try to convince her, Zoe reminds Sally that she has shredded Nick, but Nick is alive and well in her fantasy. In the house, Josh tries to find a way to shift in the house without killing either Zoe or Aidan, but Aidan cannot hold back and begins feeding on Zoe until Josh tears him away. He then offers up his blood to Aidan to drink from to keep Zoe alive, and after some hesitation he drinks from Josh, feeling an immediate buzz from the werewolf blood, until he starts to convulse in pain. In Sally's mind, Zoe is beginning to get through to her, as Sally remembers Nick's drowning death, until \"Scott\" attacks Zoe. It is not until Aidan lets out a ghastly scream from his body violently rejecting Josh's blood that Sally's self-contained illusion is broken, leaving only Sally, Zoe, and \"Scott\" left. With the illusion failing, allowing Sally to see Aidan in pain and Josh trying to revive him does she reject \"Scott\" and goes through her death once more, awakening in her ghostly body, freeing everyone. Zoe walks off, still angry, and Josh breaks the salt ring before running off to the woods to change. Aidan, recovered but seeping blood from every orifice, welcomes Sally home before he goes upstairs to rest. Zoe comes back with dressing on her wound to tell Sally she will never forgive her for what she did to Nick. Sally is left alone, except for \"Scott\" who reminds her that he is a part of her and will always be there, waiting for her to slip, again.",

Josh enlists Sally to possess Ray's wife, using her to call Ray out to a deserted stretch of road under the guise of fixing a flat tire. However, this act brings the Reaper entity back into Sally's mind. Once Ray arrives, Josh marches Ray out into the woods at gunpoint. Meanwhile, Aidan infiltrates Mother's coven and attempts to kill her and finds that Henry (who helped Aidan get inside) has been severely beaten and may be dead. Aidan is eventually captured and brought before Mother, who kills Suren in front of him. As she turns to ashes, Aidan screams in fury and attempts to kill Mother but is overpowered. Aidan is then locked in a coffin and buried alive. Elsewhere, Sally returns to the hospital to seek out her mother so she may shred her in order for Sally to be able to enter Limbo to save all of the ghosts she shredded herself, as taking another ghost's Door would condemn them to insanity. Rena refuses to kill her own daughter, and after she disappears Sally comes across Nora and she tells her Josh's plans. Sally returns back to their shared house, the Reaper still taunting her, as Rena approaches her to tell Sally how proud she is of her now that she's become so strong in death. The reconciliation brings Rena's Door forth and she offers it to Sally, believing that if she can find a way back from the Door, another will come for her. Sally thanks her mother for the offer, but takes her fate into her own hands by shredding herself, all while the Reaper protests until he too is destroyed with Sally's spirit. Back in the woods, Josh hesitates shooting Ray, who then attacks Josh and knocks the gun from his hand. Before Ray can kill Josh, Nora arrives armed with her own weapon. She and Ray have a stand-off and everything fades to black as a gunshot is heard. With Aidan buried alive and Josh's fate unknown, the empty brownhouse is quiet until a radio starts to tune itself into a particular station.

        "Josh resolves to kill Ray to save both himself and Nora from the werewolf curse while Aidan resolves to kill Mother so he and Suren may be together at last. Josh enlists Sally to possess Ray's wife, using her to call Ray out to a deserted stretch of road under the guise of fixing a flat tire. However, this act brings the Reaper entity back into Sally's mind. Once Ray arrives, Josh marches Ray out into the woods at gunpoint. Meanwhile, Aidan infiltrates Mother's coven and attempts to kill her and finds that Henry (who helped Aidan get inside) has been severely beaten and may be dead. Aidan is eventually captured and brought before Mother, who kills Suren in front of him. As she turns to ashes, Aidan screams in fury and attempts to kill Mother but is overpowered. Aidan is then locked in a coffin and buried alive. Elsewhere, Sally returns to the hospital to seek out her mother so she may shred her in order for Sally to be able to enter Limbo to save all of the ghosts she shredded herself, as taking another ghost's Door would condemn them to insanity. Rena refuses to kill her own daughter, and after she disappears Sally comes across Nora and she tells her Josh's plans. Sally returns back to their shared house, the Reaper still taunting her, as Rena approaches her to tell Sally how proud she is of her now that she's become so strong in death. The reconciliation brings Rena's Door forth and she offers it to Sally, believing that if she can find a way back from the Door, another will come for her. Sally thanks her mother for the offer, but takes her fate into her own hands by shredding herself, all while the Reaper protests until he too is destroyed with Sally's spirit. Back in the woods, Josh hesitates shooting Ray, who then attacks Josh and knocks the gun from his hand. Before Ray can kill Josh, Nora arrives armed with her own weapon. She and Ray have a stand-off and everything fades to black as a gunshot is heard.

        "Fifteen months have passed. In flashbacks, it is revealed that Josh managed to kill Ray, and he has been cured of the werewolf curse, but Nora has not been so lucky. The couple have been trying to recover Sally from Limbo, ultimately contacting a medium who happens to be the exorcist Danny hired to get rid of Sally. She at first refuses to help, but she directs the two to meet with Donna, a witch who directs them to bring her $2,000, Sally's body, and the heart of someone they have killed (they ultimately choose Ray). In Limbo, Sally, together with Nick and Stevie, have been trying to escape for the umpteenth time through Limbo's version of the brownstone; as they fail again and even Sally wants to give up, the door to the brownstone opens up because of Donna's spell. Sally convinces the others to enter the portal first to make sure the door does not close behind her, leaving them stuck in Limbo. She then awakes in her human body, telling Nora and Josh that her friends also came back with her and Nora fears that they may have woken up in their coffins. Elsewhere, Aidan has been underground in the coffin; he is rescued by Atlee who reveals that an influenza epidemic happened in the past year, and while humans had a vaccine, the inert viruses in their systems are incredibly toxic to vampires; almost all are dead including Mother. Atlee intends to bring Aidan to the other Dutch, as they all believe his pure blood will cure them. Visions of Josh and Sally try to talk Aidan into giving up, but Bishop appears to him, giving him the resolve to try to overpower Atlee, although to no success as Atlee drains him of blood. It is hours later that Atlee realizes that Aidan's blood is not a cure and falls apart into dust, causing the car they were in to crash, ejecting Aidan from the front seat. As he lies on the ground in pain, \"Josh\" and \"Sally\" tell him that maybe it is finally his time to die, but this only gives him the resolve to fight through the pain and proclaim that he will not die. Elsewhere, Donna performs an incantation in the woods, leading her directly to where Josh and Nora had buried Ray's corpse and she asks herself what she can do with him.",

However, he later realizes the ends that they had to go through, including the taking of another life and the use of blood magic. Aidan, however, feels the need for blood and goes to find his old source Tracy, who reveals she caught the flu virus that is killing the vampires. She instead sends him to the black market to find pure blood. As it is the night of the full moon, Josh plans on dropping Nora off at the storage unit, but she convinces him to go take Sally out on a night on the town, as she knows Josh sits outside the unit watching over her. At the hospital, Liam seeks out Nora. Josh takes Sally to a bar where she indulges in her new found humanity, and she tries to make Josh do the same, when he reveals he wants to propose to Nora. Sally congratulates Josh on his choice until she is recognized by an old high school friend Trent, despite the fact Donna warned Josh that Sally could not see anyone from her old life. Sally tells Trent that she had to fake her death to escape Danny, and not even her family or her estranged brother Robbie know. They hit it off well, leaving Josh to contemplate the proposal alone. Aidan has found the black market source of blood, but it is actually a trap set by the werewolves who have taken over Boston.

Sally takes Trent home, but he feels a bit of apprehension that he cannot explain, so he takes his leave for the evening. That night, Sally and Aidan catch up, and they seem to enjoy their company until Aidan feels weird about Sally's body. The next morning, Aidan has let Emma escape, angering Henry, but Aidan promises that they will find a new way to survive. With Sally awake, Josh talks to her about proposing to Nora when he opens up the storage unit, despite Sally's protests, but their discussion is cut short when they hear sirens outside. They investigate and discover that Trent is being loaded into a body bag and being sent to the morgue, with Josh realizing this was why Donna warned them about meeting people from the past: they die as a result of the blood magic.

        "Nora survives her night with Liam who says he never doubted he would not kill her, as werewolves never kill one of their own, leading her to doubt the events of Ray's death. She finally makes it back to the house, after Sally and Josh have spent all morning looking for her, and she reveals that Liam is looking for his son's killer and his daughter. Three weeks later, Aidan is playing chess with an old man in the park as part of a ruse to look for clean blood. However, when he sneezes on Henry after he compels him, Henry turns him away, in fear of the flu. Aidan promises Henry he will survive, but Henry is not that sure. At home, Sally is upset about having accidentally killed Trent, and Josh pushes her to do something about it instead of constantly eating. Aidan returns to the house, asking Josh to question his patients to see if they had the flu virus, but Josh refuses. However, at work, after promising Nora he would not, he looks through some patient files anyway. Sally heads to the funeral home where Trent is being prepared for his funeral service, seeing his ghost. She tells him that she will find a way to get him back to the other side by getting his door. Back in the hospital, Josh notices a patient's files with several missing entries and asks for more information. The patient Erin reveals to Josh that she was scratched by a strange dog during the last full moon, with Josh realizing that she must have been attacked by a werewolf and she will become one on the next full moon only a day away. Josh tells Nora about the event, saying they will keep her in the hospital for as long as they can, as she believes that as an abused girl Erin will act the same way she did after she first turned. Outside, Henry is tracking down Emma, but Aidan stops him from attacking her, as she has probably gotten the flu virus by now. Back at the hospital, Erin's social services worker arrives, ready to take her back into another foster home as the last will not take her after she stole from them and struck their grandson, but Josh and Nora prevent her from doing so, claiming that she has clearly been abused and must stay at the hospital, before both deciding to take her in and reveal the truth to her. At the funeral home, Sally continues to plead with Trent that she will find a way to get him his door, which he decides must be telling his fianc\u00e9e Candice his infidelity. Sally is shocked, but agrees to go to the memorial service to talk with Candice. In the hospital, Henry goes through several patient files before Josh stops him, and Henry taunts him by saying that now that he is human he couldn't care less about Aidan's well being. Later, Josh gives Aidan the address of a patient who has not been infected with the flu. That night, Josh and Nora sit Erin down to tell her that she will be a werewolf. She does not believe it at first, but Josh shows her a video from the storage unit of his transformation. The following day, Aidan and Henry track down the patient who did not have the flu, but Henry is too impatient and attacks the man. In the struggle of Aidan pulling him away, he sees the telltale sign that Henry has ingested virus-tainted blood. Sally and Trent wait at the memorial service, and Sally has Max, the mortician who was working on Trent, pull Candice aside. After trying to find the way for Trent to reconcile, Sally reveals to Candice that he cheated on her with him, only for Candice to reveal she has been cheating on Trent for a year, and the fact that they both believed each other to be wrong together lifts the guilt from her heart, but leaves Trent without his door. At the house, Aidan tries to get Henry to drink his untainted blood, but he will not, as it did not help Atlee. Henry admits that he gave in at the hospital, but also reveals that he knew he would never make it because everyone who Aidan loves ends up dead. Aidan tries to keep his hopes up, but the virus takes its toll on Henry quickly, and by nighttime he is fully infected with very little time left. At the funeral home, Sally tries to help Trent think of other unfinished business, but Trent gives up, thrashing out at Sally for screwing up both the living and dead worlds. He leaves, but Max talks to Sally and says he is envious that she was able to bring light into the life of Candice, and Sally finds him charming. In the woods, Nora and Erin prepare to turn, with the pot roast trick Ray had taught him, and Josh gives Erin a duffel bag full of things to use after the turn. When Erin leaves and Josh gives Nora her things to prepare for the night, he accidentally reveals he has a gun on him to protect himself just in case Erin turns out to be less like Nora and more like Brynn. The hours pass and Erin starts to be showing the signs that she is turning. Nora tries to comfort her, but the turn comes quickly for Erin. Erin then goes back to the car and tries to attack Josh. Josh holds his ground with the gun until Nora fully transforms and puts Erin in her place. Back in Boston, Aidan tries to talk to Henry, but Henry has accepted his fate, and goes to die alone. Back in the funeral home, Trent has given up hope when he sees his door appear before him. He passes through only to find himself in Donna's soup kitchen. Donna wakes up and states how happy she is to have her \"first delivery\". Trent realizes he should not be in the kitchen, but Donna dismisses the fact, and notes that it took some time for Sally to give into the urge to see someone from her past. Incredulous that he will spend the rest of eternity in the kitchen, Donna says he will in fact not spend eternity anywhere and uses an iron meat cleaver to slice through his spirit, which does not dissipate temporarily but converts to a pile of dust. Donna takes some dust from the pile and eats it, before suddenly gaining a more youthful appearance.",

In the woods, Nora and Erin prepare to turn, with the pot roast trick Ray had taught him, and Josh gives Erin a duffel bag full of things to use after the turn. When Erin leaves and Josh gives Nora her things to prepare for the night, he accidentally reveals he has a gun on him to protect himself just in case Erin turns out to be less like Nora and more like Brynn. The hours pass and Erin starts to be showing the signs that she is turning. Nora tries to comfort her, but the turn comes quickly for Erin. Erin then goes back to the car and tries to attack Josh. Josh holds his ground with the gun until Nora fully transforms and puts Erin in her place. Back in Boston, Aidan tries to talk to Henry, but Henry has accepted his fate, and goes to die alone. Back in the funeral home, Trent has given up hope when he sees his door appear before him. He passes through only to find himself in Donna's soup kitchen. Donna wakes up and states how happy she is to have her \"first delivery\". Trent realizes he should not be in the kitchen, but Donna dismisses the fact, and notes that it took some time for Sally to give into the urge to see someone from her past. Incredulous that he will spend the rest of eternity in the kitchen, Donna says he will in fact not spend eternity anywhere and uses an iron meat cleaver to slice through his spirit, which does not dissipate temporarily but converts to a pile of dust. Donna takes some dust from the pile and eats it, before suddenly gaining a more youthful appearance.",
        "Nora survives her night with Liam who says he never doubted he would not kill her, as werewolves never kill one of their own, leading her to doubt the events of Ray's death. She finally makes it back to the house, after Sally and Josh have spent all morning looking for her, and she reveals that Liam is looking for his son's killer and his daughter. Three weeks later, Aidan is playing chess with an old man in the park as part of a ruse to look for clean blood. However, when he sneezes on Henry after he compels him, Henry turns him away, in fear of the flu. Aidan promises Henry he will survive, but Henry is not that sure. At home, Sally is upset about having accidentally killed Trent, and Josh pushes her to do something about it instead of constantly eating. Aidan returns to the house, asking Josh to question his patients to see if they had the flu virus, but Josh refuses. However, at work, after promising Nora he would not, he looks through some patient files anyway. Sally heads to the funeral home where Trent is being prepared for his funeral service, seeing his ghost. She tells him that she will find a way to get him back to the other side by getting his door. Back in the hospital, Josh notices a patient's files with several missing entries and asks for more information. The patient Erin reveals to Josh that she was scratched by a strange dog during the last full moon, with Josh realizing that she must have been attacked by a werewolf and she will become one on the next full moon only a day away. Josh tells Nora about the event, saying they will keep her in the hospital for as long as they can, as she believes that as an abused girl Erin will act the same way she did after she first turned. Outside, Henry is tracking down Emma, but Aidan stops him from attacking her, as she has probably gotten the flu virus by now. Back at the hospital, Erin's social services worker arrives, ready to take her back into another foster home as the last will not take her after she stole from them and struck their grandson, but Josh and Nora prevent her from doing so, claiming that she has clearly been abused and must stay at the hospital, before both deciding to take her in and reveal the truth to her. At the funeral home, Sally continues to plead with Trent that she will find a way to get him his door, which he decides must be telling his fianc\u00e9e Candice his infidelity. Sally is shocked, but agrees to go to the memorial service to talk with Candice. In the hospital, Henry goes through several patient files before Josh stops him, and Henry taunts him by saying that now that he is human he couldn't care less about Aidan's well being. Later, Josh gives Aidan the address of a patient who has not been infected with the flu. That night, Josh and Nora sit Erin down to tell her that she will be a werewolf. She does not believe it at first, but Josh shows her a video from the storage unit of his transformation. The following day, Aidan and Henry track down the patient who did not have the flu, but Henry is too impatient and attacks the man. In the struggle of Aidan pulling him away, he sees the telltale sign that Henry has ingested virus-tainted blood. Sally and Trent wait at the memorial service, and Sally has Max, the mortician who was working on Trent, pull Candice aside. After trying to find the way for Trent to reconcile, Sally reveals to Candice that he cheated on her with him, only for Candice to reveal she has been cheating on Trent for a year, and the fact that they both believed each other to be wrong together lifts the guilt from her heart, but leaves Trent without his door. At the house, Aidan tries to get Henry to drink his untainted blood, but he will not, as it did not help Atlee. Henry admits that he gave in at the hospital, but also reveals that he knew he would never make it because everyone who Aidan loves ends up dead. Aidan tries to keep his hopes up, but the virus takes its toll on Henry quickly, and by nighttime he is fully infected with very little time left. At the funeral home, Sally tries to help Trent think of other unfinished business, but Trent gives up, thrashing out at Sally for screwing up both the living and dead worlds.

The hours pass and Erin starts to be showing the signs that she is turning. Nora tries to comfort her, but the turn comes quickly for Erin. Erin then goes back to the car and tries to attack Josh. Josh holds his ground with the gun until Nora fully transforms and puts Erin in her place. Back in Boston, Aidan tries to talk to Henry, but Henry has accepted his fate, and goes to die alone. Back in the funeral home, Trent has given up hope when he sees his door appear before him. He passes through only to find himself in Donna's soup kitchen. Donna wakes up and states how happy she is to have her \"first delivery\". Trent realizes he should not be in the kitchen, but Donna dismisses the fact, and notes that it took some time for Sally to give into the urge to see someone from her past. Incredulous that he will spend the rest of eternity in the kitchen, Donna says he will in fact not spend eternity anywhere and uses an iron meat cleaver to slice through his spirit, which does not dissipate temporarily but converts to a pile of dust. Donna takes some dust from the pile and eats it, before suddenly gaining a more youthful appearance."

        "A pack of werewolves hunt down a sickly vampire, and Liam appears to deal the finishing blow. The younger werewolf admits there's no sport anymore, but Liam says he was never in it for the sport. At the house, Sally eats breakfast voraciously, as her body still will not take on any food, when Aidan returns from his night shift at the hospital. Aidan has a nightmare where he nearly kills Kenny, who is appearing as a doctor accompanied by two nurses, and when he awakes he sees the women, Beth and Holly, from the dream are the two young women he killed for Henry previously. They have come to haunt him, as they have not been able to pass on. Josh and Nora try to find Erin, while Sally begins her first day of work at the funeral home. Max tries to introduce her to the job, but the appearance of the ghost of the man he is working on divides her attention. She lures the ghost to the garage where she uses a tire iron to disperse him. As the ghosts of Beth and Holly continue to taunt him, Nora's friend Kat arrives to drop off her rent pay for subletting Nora's apartment, and Beth and Holly taunt him to drink from her, but he leaves before the temptation takes him. Liam approaches Josh and Nora at work, seeking answers as to why Connor paid him $1,700. At the funeral home, Max attempts to flirt with Sally, and Sally, feeling things for him back, invites him over for dinner as Zoe and Nick will be spending the night and she does not want to be a third wheel. He accepts and agrees to come over at 8 o'clock, just as Sally hears another ghost talking. It is Linda, Max's mother, who keeps watch over him. At the hospital, Josh reveals he used the money Connor gave him to find a cure for himself, and a way to prolong the wolf in the twins, but nothing worked. Liam notices Josh is not a werewolf, and he is forced to reveal he had killed his maker, with Nora adding it was in her defense. Back at the house, Zoe and Nick reveal their plans to go to India, as Linda watches on and makes comments throughout the night. Still unsuspecting of the three's nature, Sally asks Linda to leave them be. At the hospital, Aidan spends some time with Kenny, who wants company, but with Beth and Holly taunting him, Aidan ultimately takes a blood sample from Kenny to drink. As the night winds down, Zoe and Sally talk about Linda, and then Sally reveals that she does not help out the new ghosts, to which Zoe is unnerved. Zoe and Nick take their leave, and Sally says good night to Max, leaning in for a kiss, but he is befuddled and leaves quickly. Aidan heads home, noticing he is being tracked by a pair of werewolves. The wolves, expecting a weak vampire, attempt to slay him, but Aidan has the strength to overwhelm them, as Liam watches on from the shadows. Kenny wakes up, lethargic from the drawn blood, surprised that Nurse Kerwin is asking for another sample, and piquing his interest in Aidan. At the house, Josh and Nora realize Aidan is feeling better, and he reveals he had drank some of Kenny's blood. At the funeral home, Max apologizes to Sally for not reciprocating their feelings the night before, when they become intimate. At the hospital, Kenny takes film of Aidan, believing that he will not appear on the film, nor will he have a reflection, but Aidan's vampirism is not like in the movies. At the funeral home, Sally is feeling better after the tryst with Max, but he is somewhat appalled as they had sex in the viewing room. Linda reappears, calling Sally a slut for taking her son's flower. Josh and Nora still cannot find Erin, when Liam approaches them, asking them to kill Aidan, or else he will take action on them. Back at the funeral home, Sally appears to dump Max and quit her job. As Josh and Nora discuss their options in dealing with Liam or Aidan, Sally wakes up to discover Linda in her room, and she realizes that Linda had taken over her body to dump Max, and roughly. At the hospital, Kenny holds up a cross to Aidan, expecting it to have some effect on him, and when it does not, he outright asks if Aidan is a vampire. Taken aback, Aidan instead explains that he should no longer be watching horror movies, and now paranoid that he may have been discovered. Sally talks with Zoe to see if there is some way to deal with Linda, and Zoe lends her her Soul Lock, a pendant made by the hill people of Thailand (that she picked up in Bangkok Airport as a cheap souvenir) that will bind Sally's spirit to her body, preventing Linda from taking over. Josh meets up with Liam, holding him at gunpoint to demand he not come near Aidan or Nora again, and admitting that when he changed he had no pack, only Aidan. Liam, taken aback by Josh's brazen act, tells him to leave. In the hospital, Kenny apologizes to Aidan, believing he may be going crazy from lack of interaction, but Aidan assuages his problems and sits to watch TV with him. Sally returns to the funeral home and prepares to exorcise Linda. Protected by the Soul Lock, Sally binds Linda with a salt line, burns sage, and prepares the rite until Linda admits that all she wants is for Max to be happy. Sally then helps her realize that what she has been doing has not been making Max happy. At the house, Liam arrives, with Erin in tow, and with Erin now back in the house he approaches Josh, commending his bravery and saying he is now part of the family. Sally manages to meet with Max again, and apologizes for \"her\" actions earlier and asks if they can start over, to which he agrees. They kiss, and Linda looks on happily. At the hospital, Aidan awakes with Nurse Kerwin's urging, demanding that she tell him about the blood samples. When she threatens to make a report, Aidan kills her, until he realizes the gravity of his actions. As he goes over ideas in his head, ultimately drinking on her blood, he wakes up from the nightmare. However, his eyes and teeth have taken on their vampiric nature, and Kenny has seen everything, just as Aidan runs out of the room with Beth and Holly still taunting.",

At the funeral home, Max attempts to flirt with Sally, and Sally, feeling things for him back, invites him over for dinner as Zoe and Nick will be spending the night and she does not want to be a third wheel. He accepts and agrees to come over at 8 o'clock, just as Sally hears another ghost talking. It is Linda, Max's mother, who keeps watch over him. At the hospital, Josh reveals he used the money Connor gave him to find a cure for himself, and a way to prolong the wolf in the twins, but nothing worked. Liam notices Josh is not a werewolf, and he is forced to reveal he had killed his maker, with Nora adding it was in her defense. Back at the house, Zoe and Nick reveal their plans to go to India, as Linda watches on and makes comments throughout the night. Still unsuspecting of the three's nature, Sally asks Linda to leave them be. At the hospital, Aidan spends some time with Kenny, who wants company, but with Beth and Holly taunting him, Aidan ultimately takes a blood sample from Kenny to drink. As the night winds down, Zoe and Sally talk about Linda, and then Sally reveals that she does not help out the new ghosts, to which Zoe is unnerved. Zoe and Nick take their leave, and Sally says good night to Max, leaning in for a kiss, but he is befuddled and leaves quickly. Aidan heads home, noticing he is being tracked by a pair of werewolves. The wolves, expecting a weak vampire, attempt to slay him, but Aidan has the strength to overwhelm them, as Liam watches on from the shadows. Kenny wakes up, lethargic from the drawn blood, surprised that Nurse Kerwin is asking for another sample, and piquing his interest in Aidan. At the house, Josh and Nora realize Aidan is feeling better, and he reveals he had drank some of Kenny's blood. At the funeral home, Max apologizes to Sally for not reciprocating their feelings the night before, when they become intimate. At the hospital, Kenny takes film of Aidan, believing that he will not appear on the film, nor will he have a reflection, but Aidan's vampirism is not like in the movies. At the funeral home, Sally is feeling better after the tryst with Max, but he is somewhat appalled as they had sex in the viewing room. Linda reappears, calling Sally a slut for taking her son's flower. Josh and Nora still cannot find Erin, when Liam approaches them, asking them to kill Aidan, or else he will take action on them. Back at the funeral home, Sally appears to dump Max and quit her job. As Josh and Nora discuss their options in dealing with Liam or Aidan, Sally wakes up to discover Linda in her room, and she realizes that Linda had taken over her body to dump Max, and roughly. At the hospital, Kenny holds up a cross to Aidan, expecting it to have some effect on him, and when it does not, he outright asks if Aidan is a vampire. Taken aback, Aidan instead explains that he should no longer be watching horror movies, and now paranoid that he may have been discovered. Sally talks with Zoe to see if there is some way to deal with Linda, and Zoe lends her her Soul Lock, a pendant made by the hill people of Thailand (that she picked up in Bangkok Airport as a cheap souvenir) that will bind Sally's spirit to her body, preventing Linda from taking over. Josh meets up with Liam, holding him at gunpoint to demand he not come near Aidan or Nora again, and admitting that when he changed he had no pack, only Aidan. Liam, taken aback by Josh's brazen act, tells him to leave. In the hospital, Kenny apologizes to Aidan, believing he may be going crazy from lack of interaction, but Aidan assuages his problems and sits to watch TV with him. Sally returns to the funeral home and prepares to exorcise Linda. Protected by the Soul Lock, Sally binds Linda with a salt line, burns sage, and prepares the rite until Linda admits that all she wants is for Max to be happy. Sally then helps her realize that what she has been doing has not been making Max happy. At the house, Liam arrives, with Erin in tow, and with Erin now back in the house he approaches Josh, commending his bravery and saying he is now part of the family. Sally manages to meet with Max again, and apologizes for \"her\" actions earlier and asks if they can start over, to which he agrees. They kiss, and Linda looks on happily. At the hospital, Aidan awakes with Nurse Kerwin's urging, demanding that she tell him about the blood samples. When she threatens to make a report, Aidan kills her, until he realizes the gravity of his actions. As he goes over ideas in his head, ultimately drinking on her blood, he wakes up from the nightmare. However, his eyes and teeth have taken on their vampiric nature, and Kenny has seen everything, just as Aidan runs out of the room with Beth and Holly still taunting.",
        "A pack of werewolves hunt down a sickly vampire, and Liam appears to deal the finishing blow. The younger werewolf admits there's no sport anymore, but Liam says he was never in it for the sport. At the house, Sally eats breakfast voraciously, as her body still will not take on any food, when Aidan returns from his night shift at the hospital. Aidan has a nightmare where he nearly kills Kenny, who is appearing as a doctor accompanied by two nurses, and when he awakes he sees the women, Beth and Holly, from the dream are the two young women he killed for Henry previously. They have come to haunt him, as they have not been able to pass on. Josh and Nora try to find Erin, while Sally begins her first day of work at the funeral home. Max tries to introduce her to the job, but the appearance of the ghost of the man he is working on divides her attention. She lures the ghost to the garage where she uses a tire iron to disperse him.

        "Aidan starts leaving the house more often to avoid being in contact with Nora. Meanwhile, Nora discovers the presence of Beth and Holly who taunt Josh without his knowledge and reveal more about the events of their deaths to Nora when Sally complains that they reappear in her room after dispersal. As Nora grieves over Erin and the deaths in the house, Sally checks up on her scalp, which is still rotting away. Liam calls Nora to give her wolfsbane to help her grieve, and she lets it slip that Brynn is dead, but covers up quickly after. At the hospital, Aidan tries to apologize to Nora, also revealing he has figured out that she killed Brynn. The two call a truce on their mutual dislike for the time being, but Nora still claims she will seek vengeance against whoever is responsible for Erin's death, even if it is Aidan. Aidan approaches Kat, trying to break off their relationship as to appease Nora, but Kat refuses the breakup and insists that they still go out the next night, the night of the full moon. Sally tries to talk to Nick to see if he is experiencing any decomposition like her, as she cannot find Stevie, while he puts food out for a stray cat, but he ushers her out of the house, before checking up on a decomposing sore on his stomach. Josh and Nora go to an open house at a house out of their price range, and after the real estate agent leaves them alone, Josh proposes to Nora, and she accepts, before the proximity of the full moon enrages her libido. At the funeral home, Sally is amazed at the work of the embalmer's wax that Max uses on a corpse he is preparing. Aidan and Kat flirt after she is done giving a lecture, until Liam and his men approach them. Aidan promises he will call Kat before the night is through, and willingly goes with Liam. At his residence in Boston, Liam tortures Aidan with various vampire-killing implements, demanding to know what has happened to his daughter, but Aidan refuses to tell him the truth he has discovered. At the funeral home, Sally tries to take some embalmer's wax, and Max catches her, believing she is stealing formaldehyde to huff, until she reveals the truth about her previous death, and her decomposing sore, to him. He is appalled that she is technically a zombie and runs out of the room. At Zoe and Nick's house, Nick watches the stray cat he has been feeding from a distance until he pounces on the cat, devouring it alive. Kat calls the brownstone and Josh picks up, asking if Aidan has returned to the house, before revealing to Josh that he went to speak with Liam, alone. Josh calls Nora, asking where Liam turns, and gathers ammunition and a silver-bladed knife before driving out to the mansion, where Liam is preparing to inject Aidan with a vial of virus-tainted whore's blood. As the full moon nears its zenith, Josh storms into the mansion, just as Aidan lies to Liam to say that he killed Brynn as well. Josh fires a few rounds at Liam, but not before Liam injects Aidan. Josh fires off a few rounds just as Liam begins to turn into a wolf, and frantically tries to get Aidan free from the chains he is bound with, managing to get him free just as Liam has fully transformed. They run away, and in a last-ditch effort Josh stabs Liam with the silver knife, only to be scratched by the transformed werewolf, and they make their escape by locking Liam in the torture chamber. At the house, Max returns with a chest of mortuary tools, now ready to accept Sally for who she is and help her cover up her rotting sore. At Zoe and Nick's, Nick cleans up the mess of killing the stray cat, before examining his chest to see his decomposition gone, and setting out another dish of cat food to catch his next meal. In the car, Josh and Aidan talk, with Josh realizing that Aidan has figured out what happened to Brynn and lied to Liam to save Nora and a means to make up for the deaths of Erin, Holly, and Beth. Josh tries to apologize for not coming sooner, just as Aidan begins to cough. They enter the house, and Max says he will call 911, but Josh, Aidan, and Sally simultaneously tell him not to. As Aidan and Josh head to the kitchen, Max demands to know the truth, but because Sally wants to protect her friends, he walks out in anger that she is still keeping secrets. Aidan stitches up Josh's wounds and Sally gives Aidan some of Kenny's blood to heal, when Josh reveals that Liam has scratched him and he will turn into a werewolf on the next full moon. Sally tries to console him as they both realize that the virus is advancing through Aidan at an alarming rate. Sally asks if it can be stopped, but Aidan says there is no way, but she proclaims they will find a way. Later that night, Sally is ravenously hungry, emptying out the fridge, as Josh and Aidan reflect on their respective curses. Sally, still hungry, eyes a pack of raw ground beef in the fridge, and after proclaiming she will never stoop that low, she gives into her hunger and eats the raw meat, finally feeling some relief from the endless hunger she has had since her resurrection.",

Sally, still hungry, eyes a pack of raw ground beef in the fridge, and after proclaiming she will never stoop that low, she gives into her hunger and eats the raw meat, finally feeling some relief from the endless hunger she has had since her resurrection.",
        "Aidan starts leaving the house more often to avoid being in contact with Nora. Meanwhile, Nora discovers the presence of Beth and Holly who taunt Josh without his knowledge and reveal more about the events of their deaths to Nora when Sally complains that they reappear in her room after dispersal. As Nora grieves over Erin and the deaths in the house, Sally checks up on her scalp, which is still rotting away. Liam calls Nora to give her wolfsbane to help her grieve, and she lets it slip that Brynn is dead, but covers up quickly after. At the hospital, Aidan tries to apologize to Nora, also revealing he has figured out that she killed Brynn. The two call a truce on their mutual dislike for the time being, but Nora still claims she will seek vengeance against whoever is responsible for Erin's death, even if it is Aidan. Aidan approaches Kat, trying to break off their relationship as to appease Nora, but Kat refuses the breakup and insists that they still go out the next night, the night of the full moon. Sally tries to talk to Nick to see if he is experiencing any decomposition like her, as she cannot find Stevie, while he puts food out for a stray cat, but he ushers her out of the house, before checking up on a decomposing sore on his stomach. Josh and Nora go to an open house at a house out of their price range, and after the real estate agent leaves them alone, Josh proposes to Nora, and she accepts, before the proximity of the full moon enrages her libido. At the funeral home, Sally is amazed at the work of the embalmer's wax that Max uses on a corpse he is preparing. Aidan and Kat flirt after she is done giving a lecture, until Liam and his men approach them. Aidan promises he will call Kat before the night is through, and willingly goes with Liam. At his residence in Boston, Liam tortures Aidan with various vampire-killing implements, demanding to know what has happened to his daughter, but Aidan refuses to tell him the truth he has discovered. At the funeral home, Sally tries to take some embalmer's wax, and Max catches her, believing she is stealing formaldehyde to huff, until she reveals the truth about her previous death, and her decomposing sore, to him. He is appalled that she is technically a zombie and runs out of the room. At Zoe and Nick's house, Nick watches the stray cat he has been feeding from a distance until he pounces on the cat, devouring it alive. Kat calls the brownstone and Josh picks up, asking if Aidan has returned to the house, before revealing to Josh that he went to speak with Liam, alone. Josh calls Nora, asking where Liam turns, and gathers ammunition and a silver-bladed knife before driving out to the mansion, where Liam is preparing to inject Aidan with a vial of virus-tainted whore's blood. As the full moon nears its zenith, Josh storms into the mansion, just as Aidan lies to Liam to say that he killed Brynn as well. Josh fires a few rounds at Liam, but not before Liam injects Aidan. Josh fires off a few rounds just as Liam begins to turn into a wolf, and frantically tries to get Aidan free from the chains he is bound with, managing to get him free just as Liam has fully transformed. They run away, and in a last-ditch effort Josh stabs Liam with the silver knife, only to be scratched by the transformed werewolf, and they make their escape by locking Liam in the torture chamber. At the house, Max returns with a chest of mortuary tools, now ready to accept Sally for who she is and help her cover up her rotting sore. At Zoe and Nick's, Nick cleans up the mess of killing the stray cat, before examining his chest to see his decomposition gone, and setting out another dish of cat food to catch his next meal. In the car, Josh and Aidan talk, with Josh realizing that Aidan has figured out what happened to Brynn and lied to Liam to save Nora and a means to make up for the deaths of Erin, Holly, and Beth. Josh tries to apologize for not coming sooner, just as Aidan begins to cough. They enter the house, and Max says he will call 911, but Josh, Aidan, and Sally simultaneously tell him not to. As Aidan and Josh head to the kitchen, Max demands to know the truth, but because Sally wants to protect her friends, he walks out in anger that she is still keeping secrets.

        "While hallucinating under the virus, Aidan flashes back to leaving his wife Susanna and son Isaac for the war, just as his coughing wakes up Josh who has been keeping watch over him. Sally brings the two of them breakfast, having bought groceries after emptying the kitchen the night before. Aidan proclaims he will go to work, even as his health deteriorates, but before he leaves, Sally uses mortician's makeup to cover up his various lesions. Josh tries to contact Nora, but she is just waking from the previous night's transformation. As she heads back to her car she crosses paths with a nude old man in the woods, who introduces himself as Pete and nonchalantly reveals to her his lycanthropy and vegetarianism. After Sally puts the finishing touches on Aidan, she tells him to use her room for his last days and he notes that something smells, making her self conscious to realize that her decomposition is starting to get noticeable. She feverishly brushes her teeth, only for the toothbrush to pierce her cheek and for a tooth to fall out. Nora and Pete head back to the road, Pete revealing he has come to Boston due to the large concentration of wolves in the city, but reveals he was never one for pack life, as wolves should only be together if they are bonded by blood or by love. After finding his RV, Nora kindly tells him they should meet again, and gives him her jacket that she used to cover him. Aidan goes to the hospital to see Kenny, who soon realizes that Aidan is dying from the virus. Aidan regretfully tells him that he will not be able to turn him, and refuses to do so as Kenny demands that it be done now before Aidan dies. Sally gets hungry again and goes to the kitchen, only to watch as a mouse gets caught in a mouse trap. She soon gives into her temptation and eats it. Nora finally comes home to learn of the events the night before, and feels horrible that Josh went in alone and now is a wolf again. She goes to the hospital to see Aidan, offering to cover for him for the day so he can rest. Meanwhile, Josh sees Sally resetting the mousetrap, but she lies that a mouse was caught and goes to check the mirror, finding her cheek and scalp restored. While Josh tends to his wounds and gets upset that he has been cursed, again, Aidan has another flashback of his times in the house, before he remembers returning to his home after his turning in the war, only to recoil in fear from his wife, revealing that while he has returned to her, he is no longer alive. When he snaps out of it, he sees Blake outside who has come to take Kenny back as her siring, with the virus ravaging Aidan even more and making him ultimately weaker than she is. Zoe meets up with Sally who reveals that Nick has bit her, but he has broken the skin and been looking at her strangely since. Josh tries to make things best for Aidan's final night when Nora brings over Kat to make peace. However, the virus takes hold of him stronger and he loses consciousness, continually flashing back to when Susanna took care of him and renewed their love for each other. After he comes to and passes out, again, Josh and Nora usher Kat out, passing off Aidan's sickness as the flu, even though they know they will never see each other, again. Sally speaks with Nick, revealing she has eaten a mouse, and he is relieved and tells her that eating fresh kills is the only way they can stave off the decomposition, while Sally is put off by Nick's gung-ho attitude about everything. Josh and Nora share a moment until Pete arrives, taking up Nora's invitation that night. Josh is upset that Pete has come on such short notice, particularly after all of the trouble that Erin and Liam have put them through, leaving to check on Aidan, and as Nora apologizes to Pete, he offers to hear their story. Elsewhere in the city, Sally is looking at a pet store window, rationalizing that her hunger is only for mice, as she gradually gets more hungry while looking at the guinea pigs, the rabbits, the kittens, and the puppies, before a young boy walks out of the store and she becomes disgusted at her hunger for the child. As Aidan rests, Pete reveals that he has had vampire friends who have also died from the virus, bringing the two closer together. As Pete tells them more of his life, he reveals he had the same problems that Josh had after his change, and suddenly changed after he accepted Gordon, his wolf, as part of himself through meditation. He leads the other two in a meditation, and Josh while dismissive at first, soon envisions himself in the woods, knowing he is being watched. Pete later makes him realize that what he saw was because his wolf is still afraid of him, because of how Josh has been trying to kill him the past several years. Aidan has another flashback, with Susanna saying they should become a family again, but Aidan believes his eternal youth makes him a monster. However, Susanna puts his fears aside, saying he should not be afraid of who he has become because everyone deserves a chance to live. Aidan wakes up from the dream, to find Josh and Sally at his side. He goes through a seizure, coughing up blood from his eyes and mouth, with Josh and Sally believing it is the end. The next morning, they are all surprised to find that he is healthy. While the others believe that he has fought the infection, their revelation that he had a seizure makes him realize that his cure was not his own doing, but because he had drank Josh's werewolf blood two years prior and Erin's blood in her assassination attempt. He goes to see Kenny, who is amazed that he is still alive, and then approaches Blake, who is also surprised. He offers her the cure, but only after she promises that Kenny as well as Josh and Nora are off limits to the vampires. She agrees, and he reveals the werewolf blood cure, and that only enough should be taken so both live. She takes it in stride, as both are watched by a werewolf who wishes to slay them. Later, Sally confesses to Aidan that she has been rotting (even though she hates the word) and has eaten live flesh, but she proclaims she will go cold turkey from then on. Her proclamation that she should use the opportunity she has in this new life spurs Aidan's memories once more to Susanna, who implores him that should the opportunity arise that he falls in love centuries later that he takes it. He goes to the university to see Kat, who is surprised that he has bounced back from the flu so easily, but he embraces her and kisses her passionately before she can say another word. Later that night, the werewolf stalking Blake corners her, but she has laid a trap with dozens of other vampires who all plan to drink from the werewolf to produce a vaccine for the virus. Elsewhere, Josh meditates once more, and finally sees his wolf in his mind's eye, marveling at his wolf's beauty, before he runs off. And at Zoe's house, she comes home to see Nick eating on a recently killed cat. She is scared, but he says he is only eating to make everything better. With his face bloody and eyes glazed over, he looks at Zoe apologetically before proclaiming that he is still hungry and lunges for her as she screams in terror.",

While Josh tends to his wounds and gets upset that he has been cursed, again, Aidan has another flashback of his times in the house, before he remembers returning to his home after his turning in the war, only to recoil in fear from his wife, revealing that while he has returned to her, he is no longer alive. When he snaps out of it, he sees Blake outside who has come to take Kenny back as her siring, with the virus ravaging Aidan even more and making him ultimately weaker than she is. Zoe meets up with Sally who reveals that Nick has bit her, but he has broken the skin and been looking at her strangely since. Josh tries to make things best for Aidan's final night when Nora brings over Kat to make peace. However, the virus takes hold of him stronger and he loses consciousness, continually flashing back to when Susanna took care of him and renewed their love for each other. After he comes to and passes out, again, Josh and Nora usher Kat out, passing off Aidan's sickness as the flu, even though they know they will never see each other, again. Sally speaks with Nick, revealing she has eaten a mouse, and he is relieved and tells her that eating fresh kills is the only way they can stave off the decomposition, while Sally is put off by Nick's gung-ho attitude about everything. Josh and Nora share a moment until Pete arrives, taking up Nora's invitation that night. Josh is upset that Pete has come on such short notice, particularly after all of the trouble that Erin and Liam have put them through, leaving to check on Aidan, and as Nora apologizes to Pete, he offers to hear their story. Elsewhere in the city, Sally is looking at a pet store window, rationalizing that her hunger is only for mice, as she gradually gets more hungry while looking at the guinea pigs, the rabbits, the kittens, and the puppies, before a young boy walks out of the store and she becomes disgusted at her hunger for the child. As Aidan rests, Pete reveals that he has had vampire friends who have also died from the virus, bringing the two closer together. As Pete tells them more of his life, he reveals he had the same problems that Josh had after his change, and suddenly changed after he accepted Gordon, his wolf, as part of himself through meditation. He leads the other two in a meditation, and Josh while dismissive at first, soon envisions himself in the woods, knowing he is being watched. Pete later makes him realize that what he saw was because his wolf is still afraid of him, because of how Josh has been trying to kill him the past several years. Aidan has another flashback, with Susanna saying they should become a family again, but Aidan believes his eternal youth makes him a monster. However, Susanna puts his fears aside, saying he should not be afraid of who he has become because everyone deserves a chance to live. Aidan wakes up from the dream, to find Josh and Sally at his side. He goes through a seizure, coughing up blood from his eyes and mouth, with Josh and Sally believing it is the end. The next morning, they are all surprised to find that he is healthy. While the others believe that he has fought the infection, their revelation that he had a seizure makes him realize that his cure was not his own doing, but because he had drank Josh's werewolf blood two years prior and Erin's blood in her assassination attempt. He goes to see Kenny, who is amazed that he is still alive, and then approaches Blake, who is also surprised. He offers her the cure, but only after she promises that Kenny as well as Josh and Nora are off limits to the vampires. She agrees, and he reveals the werewolf blood cure, and that only enough should be taken so both live. She takes it in stride, as both are watched by a werewolf who wishes to slay them. Later, Sally confesses to Aidan that she has been rotting (even though she hates the word) and has eaten live flesh, but she proclaims she will go cold turkey from then on. Her proclamation that she should use the opportunity she has in this new life spurs Aidan's memories once more to Susanna, who implores him that should the opportunity arise that he falls in love centuries later that he takes it. He goes to the university to see Kat, who is surprised that he has bounced back from the flu so easily, but he embraces her and kisses her passionately before she can say another word. Later that night, the werewolf stalking Blake corners her, but she has laid a trap with dozens of other vampires who all plan to drink from the werewolf to produce a vaccine for the virus. Elsewhere, Josh meditates once more, and finally sees his wolf in his mind's eye, marveling at his wolf's beauty, before he runs off. And at Zoe's house, she comes home to see Nick eating on a recently killed cat. She is scared, but he says he is only eating to make everything better. With his face bloody and eyes glazed over, he looks at Zoe apologetically before proclaiming that he is still hungry and lunges for her as she screams in terror.",
        "While hallucinating under the virus, Aidan flashes back to leaving his wife Susanna and son Isaac for the war, just as his coughing wakes up Josh who has been keeping watch over him. Sally brings the two of them breakfast, having bought groceries after emptying the kitchen the night before. Aidan proclaims he will go to work, even as his health deteriorates, but before he leaves, Sally uses mortician's makeup to cover up his various lesions. Josh tries to contact Nora, but she is just waking from the previous night's transformation. As she heads back to her car she crosses paths with a nude old man in the woods, who introduces himself as Pete and nonchalantly reveals to her his lycanthropy and vegetarianism. After Sally puts the finishing touches on Aidan, she tells him to use her room for his last days and he notes that something smells, making her self conscious to realize that her decomposition is starting to get noticeable. She feverishly brushes her teeth, only for the toothbrush to pierce her cheek and for a tooth to fall out. Nora and Pete head back to the road, Pete revealing he has come to Boston due to the large concentration of wolves in the city, but reveals he was never one for pack life, as wolves should only be together if they are bonded by blood or by love. After finding his RV, Nora kindly tells him they should meet again, and gives him her jacket that she used to cover him. Aidan goes to the hospital to see Kenny, who soon realizes that Aidan is dying from the virus. Aidan regretfully tells him that he will not be able to turn him, and refuses to do so as Kenny demands that it be done now before Aidan dies. Sally gets hungry again and goes to the kitchen, only to watch as a mouse gets caught in a mouse trap. She soon gives into her temptation and eats it.

While Josh tends to his wounds and gets upset that he has been cursed, again, Aidan has another flashback of his times in the house, before he remembers returning to his home after his turning in the war, only to recoil in fear from his wife, revealing that while he has returned to her, he is no longer alive. When he snaps out of it, he sees Blake outside who has come to take Kenny back as her siring, with the virus ravaging Aidan even more and making him ultimately weaker than she is. Zoe meets up with Sally who reveals that Nick has bit her, but he has broken the skin and been looking at her strangely since. Josh tries to make things best for Aidan's final night when Nora brings over Kat to make peace. However, the virus takes hold of him stronger and he loses consciousness, continually flashing back to when Susanna took care of him and renewed their love for each other. After he comes to and passes out, again, Josh and Nora usher Kat out, passing off Aidan's sickness as the flu, even though they know they will never see each other, again. Sally speaks with Nick, revealing she has eaten a mouse, and he is relieved and tells her that eating fresh kills is the only way they can stave off the decomposition, while Sally is put off by Nick's gung-ho attitude about everything. Josh and Nora share a moment until Pete arrives, taking up Nora's invitation that night. Josh is upset that Pete has come on such short notice, particularly after all of the trouble that Erin and Liam have put them through, leaving to check on Aidan, and as Nora apologizes to Pete, he offers to hear their story. Elsewhere in the city, Sally is looking at a pet store window, rationalizing that her hunger is only for mice, as she gradually gets more hungry while looking at the guinea pigs, the rabbits, the kittens, and the puppies, before a young boy walks out of the store and she becomes disgusted at her hunger for the child. As Aidan rests, Pete reveals that he has had vampire friends who have also died from the virus, bringing the two closer together. As Pete tells them more of his life, he reveals he had the same problems that Josh had after his change, and suddenly changed after he accepted Gordon, his wolf, as part of himself through meditation. He leads the other two in a meditation, and Josh while dismissive at first, soon envisions himself in the woods, knowing he is being watched. Pete later makes him realize that what he saw was because his wolf is still afraid of him, because of how Josh has been trying to kill him the past several years. Aidan has another flashback, with Susanna saying they should become a family again, but Aidan believes his eternal youth makes him a monster. However, Susanna puts his fears aside, saying he should not be afraid of who he has become because everyone deserves a chance to live. Aidan wakes up from the dream, to find Josh and Sally at his side. He goes through a seizure, coughing up blood from his eyes and mouth, with Josh and Sally believing it is the end. The next morning, they are all surprised to find that he is healthy. While the others believe that he has fought the infection, their revelation that he had a seizure makes him realize that his cure was not his own doing, but because he had drank Josh's werewolf blood two years prior and Erin's blood in her assassination attempt. He goes to see Kenny, who is amazed that he is still alive, and then approaches Blake, who is also surprised. He offers her the cure, but only after she promises that Kenny as well as Josh and Nora are off limits to the vampires. She agrees, and he reveals the werewolf blood cure, and that only enough should be taken so both live. She takes it in stride, as both are watched by a werewolf who wishes to slay them. Later, Sally confesses to Aidan that she has been rotting (even though she hates the word) and has eaten live flesh, but she proclaims she will go cold turkey from then on. Her proclamation that she should use the opportunity she has in this new life spurs Aidan's memories once more to Susanna, who implores him that should the opportunity arise that he falls in love centuries later that he takes it. He goes to the university to see Kat, who is surprised that he has bounced back from the flu so easily, but he embraces her and kisses her passionately before she can say another word. Later that night, the werewolf stalking Blake corners her, but she has laid a trap with dozens of other vampires who all plan to drink from the werewolf to produce a vaccine for the virus. Elsewhere, Josh meditates once more, and finally sees his wolf in his mind's eye, marveling at his wolf's beauty, before he runs off. And at Zoe's house, she comes home to see Nick eating on a recently killed cat. She is scared, but he says he is only eating to make everything better. With his face bloody and eyes glazed over, he looks at Zoe apologetically before proclaiming that he is still hungry and lunges for her as she screams in terror.",
        "While hallucinating under the virus, Aidan flashes back to leaving his wife Susanna and son Isaac for the war, just as his coughing wakes up Josh who has been keeping watch over him. Sally brings the two of them breakfast, having bought groceries after emptying the kitchen the night before. Aidan proclaims he will go to work, even as his health deteriorates, but before he leaves, Sally uses mortician's makeup to cover up his various lesions. Josh tries to contact Nora, but she is just waking from the previous night's transformation. As she heads back to her car she crosses paths with a nude old man in the woods, who introduces himself as Pete and nonchalantly reveals to her his lycanthropy and vegetarianism. After Sally puts the finishing touches on Aidan, she tells him to use her room for his last days and he notes that something smells, making her self conscious to realize that her decomposition is starting to get noticeable. She feverishly brushes her teeth, only for the toothbrush to pierce her cheek and for a tooth to fall out. Nora and Pete head back to the road, Pete revealing he has come to Boston due to the large concentration of wolves in the city, but reveals he was never one for pack life, as wolves should only be together if they are bonded by blood or by love. After finding his RV, Nora kindly tells him they should meet again, and gives him her jacket that she used to cover him. Aidan goes to the hospital to see Kenny, who soon realizes that Aidan is dying from the virus. Aidan regretfully tells him that he will not be able to turn him, and refuses to do so as Kenny demands that it be done now before Aidan dies. Sally gets hungry again and goes to the kitchen, only to watch as a mouse gets caught in a mouse trap. She soon gives into her temptation and eats it. Nora finally comes home to learn of the events the night before, and feels horrible that Josh went in alone and now is a wolf again. She goes to the hospital to see Aidan, offering to cover for him for the day so he can rest. Meanwhile, Josh sees Sally resetting the mousetrap, but she lies that a mouse was caught and goes to check the mirror, finding her cheek and scalp restored. While Josh tends to his wounds and gets upset that he has been cursed, again, Aidan has another flashback of his times in the house, before he remembers returning to his home after his turning in the war, only to recoil in fear from his wife, revealing that while he has returned to her, he is no longer alive.

        "Josh tries once more to commune with his wolf, but the wolf still will not trust him. Elsewhere, Aidan has a flashback to when he and Susanna failed to produce a child, for what was another time, before he wakes up in a gutter, barefoot. Upon returning home, Sally psychoanalyzes him, believing that he is sexually backed up and Kat is pushing his buttons. He denies it and goes to take a shower when Sally receives a call from Zoe. At Pete's RV, after Josh reveals that he does not know how he really fits in with the world anymore, Pete offers him the chance to make things right with his wolf that night if he brings a six-pack of beer. At Zoe and Nick's place, Zoe reveals she has had to kill Nick in self-defense using a nearby baseball bat after he attacked her. Nick's ghost returns to assuage their fears, but to warn Zoe that Sally is a danger to her just as he was, just as his Door, emblazoned with a gilded clamshell, appears. He passes through, and Zoe asks Sally not to speak with her, again, out of fear that her hunger will soon be out of control as well. Josh later helps Sally dispose of Nick's once again lifeless body, revealing to him the decomposition and hunger. As he tries to figure out what to do should Sally end up in the same way, Sally suddenly remembers Stevie. Aidan has another flashback, remembering when the Corwich, Massachusetts, Reverend Herring used their recent loss in his mass the following Sunday. Aidan is upset, and feels that Herring is only jealous that he was the one to woo Susanna, and later shows that his faith is wavering when he admits to his wife that if the God the reverend speaks of would not want them to have a child, simply because there is darkness in their hearts, then it is not the God he wants to believe in. Back in the present day, Kat takes Aidan to Boston's rare book archive to show him the book Days on the Charles, a book written by Edmund Waite (his father) after Kat heard him say Corwich in his \"fever\" dreams. Although Aidan nearly lets it slip that the author is indeed his father, their attention is soon drawn to Jeff Westin, Kat's ex-boyfriend and former college professor who has brought along his newest girlfriend. Sally and Josh find their way to Stevie's parents old place, expecting to have to reveal to the boy's parents that he is alive and now a flesh-craving undead, when they instead find Stevie who lets them in. Aidan and Kat continue their awkward meeting with Jeff and his new student Marissa, when Kat asks if they are at the archives to see the atlases, the same first date she had with Jeff years before. They leave, but Kat needs to drink. At Stevie's house, Stevie reveals he ran out of money upon getting to Memphis, and tried to get a job and living on the street until he tells them that they went to their Lake House, feeling secure that his family will not come home early from the vacation. Sally tells him he has to come home with them immediately. At Kat's apartment, she reveals the relationship she had with Jeff, with her wanting to get married and have children, after which their relationship fell apart. Aidan reveals to her that he can also not have children (although not why) and knows what she is going through. He has another flashback to when Reverend Herring came to visit his and Susanna's house after he stopped going to church for two months. The two verbally cross swords, until Herring strikes a chord and Aidan punches him in the face, further cementing his loss of faith. Back at Stevie's house, Stevie tries to talk his way out of going with them, until Sally reveals Nick is dead and that she is decomposing. Josh notices an odd smell in the house, finding a severed arm in the bread box. Stevie then reveals he came home earlier than he said before and saw his parents, but it was long before the spell's side effects were lifted and they died. Using his knowledge of their passwords and pin numbers, he kept the charade that they were still alive until he began to hunger and decompose, eventually eating their long dead corpses. However, he reveals the man's arm in the bread box is actually the mailman's. Stevie still feels guilty, and asks them help him kill himself, as he has tried to hang himself in the garage for weeks but chickens out at the last moment. Sally and Josh try to talk him out of it until he lunges at Josh in hunger. Josh, knowing that he is too far gone and that this is now what his life has become, tells Sally to leave the garage. After taking care of business, Josh calms Sally down, reminding her that they will find a way to stop things, until Stevie's ghost arrives to thank them for helping him. His Door appears and he gets ready to go through it, until Sally notices the gilded clamshell and realizes something is wrong, but Stevie passes through before she can stop him. Aidan and Kat say good night to each other, and they begin to get intimate until Aidan feels the blood lust. He excuses himself and prepares to leave, but decides to drink a blood bag he had with him to sate his hunger, returning to Kat's apartment moments later having changed his mind. As Josh tries to cover up his fingerprints after finding the arm, Sally reveals that ghosts' Doors are never the same, and that they have to figure out what is going on. She says she does not have much time left, with Josh believing she is afraid of what is on the other side of the Door, but she reveals that she is instead hungering for human flesh. Josh returns to the RV to find Pete being attacked by vampires seeking the blood cure. Josh tries to save him, and the vampires attack him until Pete calls out Josh's name, revealing to Josh that he and Nora are somehow off limits from the vampires, and they return to drinking Pete's blood. Aidan has yet another flashback, where Susanna is in labor once more, and he begs for God to let their wife and yet-to-be-born child live and he will be the Lord's servant for as long as he may live, promising to be a good man. As his prayers and his wife's screams of agony end, Aidan hears the healthy cries of a baby, just as the midwife reveals he has had a son. As Aidan holds Isaac for the first time in the 18th century, he wakes up in an alley, his odd blackouts still not cured. As he heads off, he unknowingly passes by the blood-drained body of Jeff Westin.",

Back at Stevie's house, Stevie tries to talk his way out of going with them, until Sally reveals Nick is dead and that she is decomposing. Josh notices an odd smell in the house, finding a severed arm in the bread box. Stevie then reveals he came home earlier than he said before and saw his parents, but it was long before the spell's side effects were lifted and they died. Using his knowledge of their passwords and pin numbers, he kept the charade that they were still alive until he began to hunger and decompose, eventually eating their long dead corpses. However, he reveals the man's arm in the bread box is actually the mailman's. Stevie still feels guilty, and asks them help him kill himself, as he has tried to hang himself in the garage for weeks but chickens out at the last moment. Sally and Josh try to talk him out of it until he lunges at Josh in hunger. Josh, knowing that he is too far gone and that this is now what his life has become, tells Sally to leave the garage.

As Josh tries to cover up his fingerprints after finding the arm, Sally reveals that ghosts' Doors are never the same, and that they have to figure out what is going on. She says she does not have much time left, with Josh believing she is afraid of what is on the other side of the Door, but she reveals that she is instead hungering for human flesh.

        "Josh and Aidan fight after the vampires killed Pete the previous night, particularly because Aidan revealed the cure to the other vampires. Aidan says he did not mean for Pete to die, but Josh is upset that he even decided to help the others. Aidan goes to check on Kenny who has been told that he has a bone marrow donor match, but he does not want to go through the surgery and slim chance of success and would rather take his chances in the outside world. Aidan forbids him from leaving, but Kenny gives him an ultimatum: either he turns him now or Kenny leaves on his own accord. Aidan reluctantly agrees and sneaks Kenny out of the hospital, where he enjoys time out in the sunshine and playing with a dog. At the house, Sally begs for Nora and Josh to lock her up in her bedroom in case the hunger gets stronger. After they reluctantly agree they find Aidan has returned to the house, and with Kenny. Aidan reveals to the others that he promised he would turn Kenny, and despite Josh's misgivings on the previous events concerning Erin and Stevie, Nora says she believes they should help out anyone they can if they have the chance. Josh, Nora, and Sally decide to meet with Donna to get her to change things, and Josh has brought a gun along just in case, but when they get to the soup kitchen it has disappeared completely. With everything falling apart around them, Nora suggests to Josh that they get married in the next couple of days before Sally dies, again, as they would never invite either of their families along anyway. Meanwhile, Sally goes to see Max, begging him for help after revealing the extent of her changes, particularly due to her discovery of an obituary for a lonely women who is intended for cremation, but Max does not let her eat, saying it is his job to watch after the dead. She tells him she would not come for his help in such a state because of her love for him, and he reveals he has loved her as well, but both proclamations come too late. At the house, Kenny is enjoying his day out in the world, having finally seen a Red Sox game, when Josh's sister Emily drops by, invited by Nora, for the wedding which they will have in two days on Thursday. To celebrate, Emily takes Josh, Kenny, and Aidan to a strip club for Josh's bachelor party. Meanwhile, Sally is at the funeral home helping prep a body with Max, but when he leaves the room, she takes a bite, only to see Max's body beneath her. She wakes up from this nightmare in terror, and discovers another open sore on her back. At the strip club, Kenny enjoys his first time there, with Emily revealing that one stripper in particular, Sadie, as well as several other strippers in the club are lesbians like herself. Josh and Aidan argue over the latter's choice to turn Kenny, as Josh feels he resembles Henry, when Aidan stops Kenny from flaunting what will be his vampirism. While distracting Kenny, Aidan sees a figure watching him from across the room. Emily, however, has Sadie give Josh a lap dance for his bachelor party. At the house, Nora tries to cheer Sally up by having a makeshift bachelorette party, complete with wine coolers and penis straws, as they talk plans for the wedding. In the private room, Sadie tries to get Josh to loosen up, but she is soon revealed to be a vampire after Josh's werewolf blood, as he is now starting to smell like a wolf, again. Aidan stakes Sadie through the heart, saving Josh, but with Emily and Kenny viewing the events. Josh reveals the truth to Emily, that he and Nora are werewolves and Aidan is a vampire, and that they have all killed, but Emily is too upset, particularly after Josh equates his condition to her lesbianism, and storms off. Kenny, however, is worried that Aidan may have to turn the stake on him, but Aidan promises that his experience with all of his previous mistakes will mean the best for Kenny. With Kenny resting after Aidan's bite, Josh and Aidan reconcile their differences about Pete's death and the other events that have unfolded, and Josh realizes that despite their curses the can still be who they want to be. Upstairs, Aidan talks to Sally, who reveals that she wants him to be the one to kill her should the hunger be too strong. Aidan tells her that they have gotten in touch with Ilana Myers who may know how to fight Donna. Sally is reluctant to go, but Aidan insists, and even allows her to eat his flesh to satisfy her hunger for the time being. After much difficulty in biting through Aidan's stomach, Sally speaks with Ilana to try to figure what to do, revealing the same Door for Stevie and Nick, and Ilana realizes it must lead to somewhere on Earth rather than to the next world. Sally asks if she can avoid the Door, but Ilana realizes there would be no escape, but once she passes through she may be able to fight back. Sally is reluctant, but Ilana says she must be very powerful, as she has survived an exorcism, came back from the dead, and brought two souls back with her. Sally is ready, but Ilana tells her she must resolve any issues she has in this second life, and after Sally asks what she does afterwards, Ilana grabs an old book off of a shelf and asks how good Sally is at Latin, preparing her to learn some magic of her own. At the funeral home, Sally says goodbye to Max for the last time, knowing there may be no coming back for her, and Max is upset that he wanted to try everything to make their relationship work, something that pleases Sally. Aidan leaves the house, still sore from Sally's bite, when the hooded figure from the strip club attacks him, saying he is hungry. After a fight, during which the other man, a disfigured vampire, has the upperhand, but Aidan manages to stake him through the heart.

        "Josh and Aidan fight after the vampires killed Pete the previous night, particularly because Aidan revealed the cure to the other vampires. Aidan says he did not mean for Pete to die, but Josh is upset that he even decided to help the others. Aidan goes to check on Kenny who has been told that he has a bone marrow donor match, but he does not want to go through the surgery and slim chance of success and would rather take his chances in the outside world. Aidan forbids him from leaving, but Kenny gives him an ultimatum: either he turns him now or Kenny leaves on his own accord. Aidan reluctantly agrees and sneaks Kenny out of the hospital, where he enjoys time out in the sunshine and playing with a dog. At the house, Sally begs for Nora and Josh to lock her up in her bedroom in case the hunger gets stronger. After they reluctantly agree they find Aidan has returned to the house, and with Kenny. Aidan reveals to the others that he promised he would turn Kenny, and despite Josh's misgivings on the previous events concerning Erin and Stevie, Nora says she believes they should help out anyone they can if they have the chance. Josh, Nora, and Sally decide to meet with Donna to get her to change things, and Josh has brought a gun along just in case, but when they get to the soup kitchen it has disappeared completely. With everything falling apart around them, Nora suggests to Josh that they get married in the next couple of days before Sally dies, again, as they would never invite either of their families along anyway. Meanwhile, Sally goes to see Max, begging him for help after revealing the extent of her changes, particularly due to her discovery of an obituary for a lonely women who is intended for cremation, but Max does not let her eat, saying it is his job to watch after the dead. She tells him she would not come for his help in such a state because of her love for him, and he reveals he has loved her as well, but both proclamations come too late. At the house, Kenny is enjoying his day out in the world, having finally seen a Red Sox game, when Josh's sister Emily drops by, invited by Nora, for the wedding which they will have in two days on Thursday. To celebrate, Emily takes Josh, Kenny, and Aidan to a strip club for Josh's bachelor party. Meanwhile, Sally is at the funeral home helping prep a body with Max, but when he leaves the room, she takes a bite, only to see Max's body beneath her. She wakes up from this nightmare in terror, and discovers another open sore on her back. At the strip club, Kenny enjoys his first time there, with Emily revealing that one stripper in particular, Sadie, as well as several other strippers in the club are lesbians like herself. Josh and Aidan argue over the latter's choice to turn Kenny, as Josh feels he resembles Henry, when Aidan stops Kenny from flaunting what will be his vampirism. While distracting Kenny, Aidan sees a figure watching him from across the room. Emily, however, has Sadie give Josh a lap dance for his bachelor party. At the house, Nora tries to cheer Sally up by having a makeshift bachelorette party, complete with wine coolers and penis straws, as they talk plans for the wedding. In the private room, Sadie tries to get Josh to loosen up, but she is soon revealed to be a vampire after Josh's werewolf blood, as he is now starting to smell like a wolf, again. Aidan stakes Sadie through the heart, saving Josh, but with Emily and Kenny viewing the events. Josh reveals the truth to Emily, that he and Nora are werewolves and Aidan is a vampire, and that they have all killed, but Emily is too upset, particularly after Josh equates his condition to her lesbianism, and storms off. Kenny, however, is worried that Aidan may have to turn the stake on him, but Aidan promises that his experience with all of his previous mistakes will mean the best for Kenny. With Kenny resting after Aidan's bite, Josh and Aidan reconcile their differences about Pete's death and the other events that have unfolded, and Josh realizes that despite their curses the can still be who they want to be. Upstairs, Aidan talks to Sally, who reveals that she wants him to be the one to kill her should the hunger be too strong. Aidan tells her that they have gotten in touch with Ilana Myers who may know how to fight Donna. Sally is reluctant to go, but Aidan insists, and even allows her to eat his flesh to satisfy her hunger for the time being. After much difficulty in biting through Aidan's stomach, Sally speaks with Ilana to try to figure what to do, revealing the same Door for Stevie and Nick, and Ilana realizes it must lead to somewhere on Earth rather than to the next world. Sally asks if she can avoid the Door, but Ilana realizes there would be no escape, but once she passes through she may be able to fight back. Sally is reluctant, but Ilana says she must be very powerful, as she has survived an exorcism, came back from the dead, and brought two souls back with her. Sally is ready, but Ilana tells her she must resolve any issues she has in this second life, and after Sally asks what she does afterwards, Ilana grabs an old book off of a shelf and asks how good Sally is at Latin, preparing her to learn some magic of her own. At the funeral home, Sally says goodbye to Max for the last time, knowing there may be no coming back for her, and Max is upset that he wanted to try everything to make their relationship work, something that pleases Sally.

She tells him she would not come for his help in such a state because of her love for him, and he reveals he has loved her as well, but both proclamations come too late. At the house, Kenny is enjoying his day out in the world, having finally seen a Red Sox game, when Josh's sister Emily drops by, invited by Nora, for the wedding which they will have in two days on Thursday. To celebrate, Emily takes Josh, Kenny, and Aidan to a strip club for Josh's bachelor party. Meanwhile, Sally is at the funeral home helping prep a body with Max, but when he leaves the room, she takes a bite, only to see Max's body beneath her. She wakes up from this nightmare in terror, and discovers another open sore on her back. At the strip club, Kenny enjoys his first time there, with Emily revealing that one stripper in particular, Sadie, as well as several other strippers in the club are lesbians like herself. Josh and Aidan argue over the latter's choice to turn Kenny, as Josh feels he resembles Henry, when Aidan stops Kenny from flaunting what will be his vampirism. While distracting Kenny, Aidan sees a figure watching him from across the room. Emily, however, has Sadie give Josh a lap dance for his bachelor party. At the house, Nora tries to cheer Sally up by having a makeshift bachelorette party, complete with wine coolers and penis straws, as they talk plans for the wedding. In the private room, Sadie tries to get Josh to loosen up, but she is soon revealed to be a vampire after Josh's werewolf blood, as he is now starting to smell like a wolf, again. Aidan stakes Sadie through the heart, saving Josh, but with Emily and Kenny viewing the events. Josh reveals the truth to Emily, that he and Nora are werewolves and Aidan is a vampire, and that they have all killed, but Emily is too upset, particularly after Josh equates his condition to her lesbianism, and storms off. Kenny, however, is worried that Aidan may have to turn the stake on him, but Aidan promises that his experience with all of his previous mistakes will mean the best for Kenny. With Kenny resting after Aidan's bite, Josh and Aidan reconcile their differences about Pete's death and the other events that have unfolded, and Josh realizes that despite their curses the can still be who they want to be. Upstairs, Aidan talks to Sally, who reveals that she wants him to be the one to kill her should the hunger be too strong. Aidan tells her that they have gotten in touch with Ilana Myers who may know how to fight Donna. Sally is reluctant to go, but Aidan insists, and even allows her to eat his flesh to satisfy her hunger for the time being. After much difficulty in biting through Aidan's stomach, Sally speaks with Ilana to try to figure what to do, revealing the same Door for Stevie and Nick, and Ilana realizes it must lead to somewhere on Earth rather than to the next world. Sally asks if she can avoid the Door, but Ilana realizes there would be no escape, but once she passes through she may be able to fight back. Sally is reluctant, but Ilana says she must be very powerful, as she has survived an exorcism, came back from the dead, and brought two souls back with her. Sally is ready, but Ilana tells her she must resolve any issues she has in this second life, and after Sally asks what she does afterwards, Ilana grabs an old book off of a shelf and asks how good Sally is at Latin, preparing her to learn some magic of her own. At the funeral home, Sally says goodbye to Max for the last time, knowing there may be no coming back for her, and Max is upset that he wanted to try everything to make their relationship work, something that pleases Sally. Aidan leaves the house, still sore from Sally's bite, when the hooded figure from the strip club attacks him, saying he is hungry. After a fight, during which the other man, a disfigured vampire, has the upperhand, but Aidan manages to stake him through the heart. As the vampire crumbles away, he asks why Aidan had done this to him, and his face becomes less disfigured as Aidan realizes the vampire was Kat's ex-boyfriend Jeff Westin. Emily has not returned, and Nora tries to cheer Josh up saying she may come back, but Josh knows his sister is stubborn, and that with Emily gone, Liam wanting them dead, and the vampires would not heed Aidan's requests, but Nora says all she needs for her wedding is him, and to prevent Sally from eating her. Aidan goes to check on Kenny, worried that the virus has had some more side effects, but Kenny is still peacefully sleeping. Elsewhere, Ilana is woken up by a sound in her house, when she is accosted by Ray, seeking to know what she has told Sally. Ilana begs for Donna to leave Sally alone and attempts to banish the spirit from Ray's body, before Ray snaps her neck and says Ilana picked the losing side in the fight.",
        "Josh and Aidan fight after the vampires killed Pete the previous night, particularly because Aidan revealed the cure to the other vampires. Aidan says he did not mean for Pete to die, but Josh is upset that he even decided to help the others. Aidan goes to check on Kenny who has been told that he has a bone marrow donor match, but he does not want to go through the surgery and slim chance of success and would rather take his chances in the outside world. Aidan forbids him from leaving, but Kenny gives him an ultimatum: either he turns him now or Kenny leaves on his own accord. Aidan reluctantly agrees and sneaks Kenny out of the hospital, where he enjoys time out in the sunshine and playing with a dog. At the house, Sally begs for Nora and Josh to lock her up in her bedroom in case the hunger gets stronger. After they reluctantly agree they find Aidan has returned to the house, and with Kenny. Aidan reveals to the others that he promised he would turn Kenny, and despite Josh's misgivings on the previous events concerning Erin and Stevie, Nora says she believes they should help out anyone they can if they have the chance. Josh, Nora, and Sally decide to meet with Donna to get her to change things, and Josh has brought a gun along just in case, but when they get to the soup kitchen it has disappeared completely. With everything falling apart around them, Nora suggests to Josh that they get married in the next couple of days before Sally dies, again, as they would never invite either of their families along anyway.

        "It's Josh & Nora's wedding day; Sally starts the day with a nightmare, being carved up by Donna. Kat arrives to attend the ceremony, which Aiden will officiate; he apologises to Kat for leaving her after they had sex, explaining that he only acted as he did as it has been so long since his last relationship. Nora discovers that Sally is rotting away. They decide to postpone the wedding to say their goodbyes. Josh realises the Door Sally had seen is a portal to Donna. As her death draws near Sally begins to feel afraid, as her original death was sudden, and Aidan walks her through it, assuaging her fears as she passes away. It is only a few moments later that she feels herself awake, and she is a ghost, once more. Aiden pulls the heart from Sally's corpse, believing it will be the perfect weapon to use against Donna's own black magic, as it has the most magical potential. Josh says his goodbyes to Nora, as the three friends go through the portal. They awake in what appears to be the soup kitchen, but Josh can see Sally perfectly, as they are now in some alternate pocket dimension that Donna calls home. Donna has brought Ray to protect her; Josh battles the wolf while Aiden and Sally confront Donna, with Sally reciting the incantation she got from Ilana; while it does have some effect, Donna reveals it was only a \"true face\" spell. Josh manages to behead Ray, killing him once and for all. Donna is starving and prepares to eat Sally's spirit, although commending her on fighting back. Aidan throws Sally's heart into a flame Donna has made, and it begins to immolate Donna. However, Donna uses the flames to return the source of the magical pain to Sally, whose spirit goes up in flames. Sally says she loves Aidan and Josh before Donna uses a cleaver to disperse her spirit, ingesting the dust it has left behind. Gloating over her victory, Donna radiates a bright light; she screams in agony and suddenly Josh, Aidan, and Sally's spirit are back in the bedroom, and they realize they have won. Josh says that they should postpone their wedding until after the full moon so he can properly see Sally, but Emily arrives, having come to terms with the gang's supernatural nature. When Josh tells her they will be postponing the wedding, Emily refuses, and forces them to have the wedding that day just as they had planned. Later, in a cabin in the woods, Josh and Nora enjoy their honeymoon bed. When the fire dies low, Nora decides to get some more firewood rather than let Josh go out, but as she exits the cabin, Liam confronts her.",

        "At gunpoint, Liam takes Josh and Nora to a warehouse in Boston, showing them a nest of the strange new vampires created after the flu-cursed vampires drank too much werewolf blood. Liam says they kill without prejudice, even killing young children. Liam wants to make a family with Josh and Nora, but they refuse, and Nora reveals she killed Brynn. Back at the house, Kenny has woken up, screaming in terror of what he has become. Kat discovers Sally's corpse and runs away. Aiden confesses to Sally he has long wanted a family, in part due to what happened to his wife and son (shown in flashbacks). Learning of Kenny, Liam locks Josh and Nora with the feral vampires and returns to the brownstone to kill him in revenge. Josh and Nora escape, burning the vampires away, and arrive just in time to stop Liam, but Aiden is the one to kill him, which will leave Josh a wolf forever. The ravenous Kenny drinks from Nora, and could have killed her if Josh had not stopped him. Josh admits to Nora that he now feels closer to his wolf than before, particularly after the event with Donna. Aiden has Blake compel Kat so that she forgets what she has seen.

Sur le refus de la demoiselle, il lui avait li\u00e9 les mains, et l'avait fait conduire au ch\u00e2teau et mettre dans une affreuse prison.

Ne pouvant rien obtenir, il la posa sur une poutre par le milieu du corps, de sorte que la t\u00eate et les pieds pendaient ; il lui suspendit aux jambes et aux bras des cabas charg\u00e9s de pierres, et la laissa dans cette position. Le sang sortit par les narines de cette malheureuse, qui ne fut d\u00e9livr\u00e9e qu'\u00e0 condition d'avouer, ce qui \u00e9tait faux, qu'elle avait eu un enfant. Pierre paiera cinq cents livres d'amende au Roi et cent livres \u00e0 la demoiselle."

At the old wing of the hospital, Sally finds a message from Nicholas Fenn, one of her teaching assistants from college on whom she had a crush and who has died. They begin to hang out, but Nick relives his drowning death every day. Rebecca turns Bernie for Aidan, thinking it will cheer him up but Aidan knows that children should not be made into vampires. Bernie believes he has superpowers now and plans on only using them to hurt bad people, but Aidan tells him he should not hurt any humans. Later, Aidan comes across a crime scene with the bullies killed and Bishop berates him for having turned a child, despite Aidan telling him it was Rebecca who turned Bernie. Sally tries to figure out a way to help Nick and realizes that she takes her boyfriends' problems onto herself, but Nick reassures her that now he has something good to come back to after the \"echo\". Aidan takes Bernie to the woods to stalk a deer; he uses this excuse to stake the boy. Meanwhile, Bishop thanks Marcus for killing the two bullies so that Aidan would kill Bernie. Elsewhere, Josh tries to tell Nora he is distancing himself from loved ones due to his condition.
