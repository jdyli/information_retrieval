In the end, Ieyasu stands firm in his alliance with Oda, and orders his army to advance on Takeda and Uesugi's armies. While the two-on-one battle quickly gains favor of the alliance, Ieyasu summons his general, Honda Tadakatsu, an enormous man with an enormous drill for a weapon, who quickly turns the tide of battle.

The two are quick to begin their fight, but midway, as Masamune begins to gain ground on Nagamasa, he stops at the heralding of Oda himself on a nearby cliff face. Oda, still in possession of Oichi, sends his men to flank around behind Nagamasa in order to take aim at Masamune. Seeing through this, Oichi rides off with Akechi, through Akechi's sadism and Oda's unemphatic tendency, to warn Nagamasa that Oda will shoot through him to reach Masamune.

Matsunaga refuses, saying that a negotiation is out of question unless his initial demands are met first. Yukimura finally arrives at the scene and hands over the armor. Sasuke tries to sneak past Matsunaga, but unfortunately Matsunaga senses Sasuke's presence, and he destroys his surroundings and everyone else's with a series of explosions.

        "Matsunaga Hisahide is intrigued by Katakura Koj\u016br\u014d's arrival, and plans to use him in order to force Takeda's hand. Under normal circumstances, Takeda will not lend out the armor for the life of foreign soldiers, but this condition changes if Koj\u016br\u014d - the highest ranking vassal of the Date army and Masamune's confidant - gets captured and taken hostage. Matsunaga wanted to drive a wedge between the two factions. This is his display of contempt toward the will and purpose of the Anti-Oda alliance. Miyoshi Death Squad blocks Koj\u016br\u014d's path, using a special incense which works as slow acting poison. With his strength reduced, Koj\u016br\u014d has a hard time fending off his enemies, but he overcomes with quick thinking, skill, and sheer willpower. Yukimura and Sasuke arrives at T\u014ddai-ji some time later. With the lingering presence of poison in the air, they worry about Koj\u016br\u014d's current state and follow after him. Matsunaga greets Koj\u016br\u014d at a temple ruin. He is surprised that Koj\u016br\u014d actually brought Date Masamune's swords and mocks Date for throwing away his precious swords for mere lives of grunt soldiers.

        "Oda Nobunaga advances from Kyushu where he cuts down all in his path, killing both Shimazu Yoshihiro and Zabby, and decimating their forces. Meanwhile, the other alliance generals recoup, Date Masamune (who is now up and about) and Koj\u016br\u014d are once again on equal terms, while Takeda Shingen gifts Sanada Yukimura with a new spear to replace the one that was lost during the previous battle. However, Sarutobi Sasuke bring bad news as he fills the others in on Nobunaga's movements as well as the fact that many warlords are falling to Owari forces. This includes Tokugawa Ieyasu, who has been assassinated by Akechi Mitsuhide. It is figured that Oda's vassals will soon be coming after Masamune, Shingen and Uesugi Kenshin. Yet, Sasuke feels no need to send a warning to Kenshin since the man's own scouts must have informed him of the advance by now. Meanwhile, Kenshin and Kasuga have an intellectual talk, but they are interrupted by a shinobi who professes to work for Sasuke, showing the Takeda Clan symbol. Kenshin decides to meet with her, but after only a few words, the woman shoots at him instead. The shinobi reveals herself to be N\u014dhime and proceeds to initiate a battle between herself and the warlord. She is quickly subdued, but Mori Ranmaru shows up as her back up, killing Kenshin's men and wounding the general himself. N\u014dhime takes advantage of the situation and aims her guns at Kenshin. Kasuga steps in to take the hit, but Kenshin pulls her away, taking a bullet in the chest, abdomen, and wrist. After the warlord falls, N\u014dhime and Ranmaru escape, leaving a devastated Kasuga holding the body of her lord in the rain.

Masamune and Koj\u016br\u014d also show up, and Masamune is enraged by the sight of his enemy from the last battle. Using one of his attacks, Akechi destroys the dam, causing all the men and villagers to be swept away. While Shingen tries to hold his own against the raging water, Akechi jabs the blade of his scythe into the warlord, causing the man to lose his grip and fall into the river. Yukimura dives into the water to save his lord, but fails to reach him.

She blames herself deeply and makes up her mind to assassinate Oda by herself. Sasuke tries to put a sense into her, but no avail - his words cannot offer her any comfortFinally relenting, he hands to her a small wooden whistle. Due to the destruction of Ryuoh levee, Kai is devastated by flood and torrent of water sweeps everything in its path. Yukimura finds himself washed up ashore along with Shingen. He calls on his lord desperately and tries to wake him up, but Shingen would not open his eyes. His scream echoes the riverside. At Oda's throne room in Owari, Oichi asks Oda about why he continues on with these senseless violences and conquests. Oda throws a double-bladed naginata at her feet as his answer. Akechi enters, interrupting their confrontation, and compliments Oda for his brutal campaigns. He brings up a plan with its own twist to wipe out the remaining factions and Oda approves his deployment. After settling Takeda Shingen in the room of Shieldless Armor, Masamune and Koj\u016br\u014d listen to Sasuke's information on Oda army's movement and discuss their next move.

Sasuke reminds him of his duty, but Yukimura confesses that he feels lost in confusion and the uncertainty is making him scared. Masamune leaves Yukimura to himself and walks out. Once outside, he orders his army to disband and expresses his will to go alone. The decision stuns everyone including Yukimura, enough to make him run out to the courtyard and ask why would he do this to his royal soldiers who sworn to serve him. Masamune finds him unconvincing and points out how unfitting Yukimura is to wear his six coins (\u516d\u6587\u9322; insignia of bravery; also, Sanada clan emblem) in his current state. After he leaves, Koj\u016br\u014d explains the meaning behind Masaume's action and helps Yukimura to realize his reason to fight.

        "The episode starts with Yukimura and Masamune leading the multi-faction army toward Azuchi Castle. Sasuke leaves the entourage to stop the rest of Oda army heading the same way for castle defense. With high morale, men of era runs toward the battlefield where the overlord awaits. Koj\u016br\u014d and Mitsuhide fight against each other, when Ranmaru wanders in there too. Mitsuhide tries to take advantage of the situation by taking Ranmaru as a hostage, but Koj\u016br\u014d was already aware of the child's identity and attacks the general regardless. In the end Koj\u016br\u014d wins and lets Ranmaru live although he is Oda Nobunaga's underling. As expected, the doors of Azuchi castle are strong. Date Masamune starts to feel his battle wounds aching. Just as they feel stumped, supporting fires shoot through the sky and destroy the castle walls and anybody unfortunate enough to stand close to the impact. Allies from Tosa (Ch\u014dsokabe Motochika) and Aki (M\u014dri Motonari) have arrived! Now the alliance to rise against Oda Nobunaga the demon king, imagined by Maeda Keiji and Takeda Shingen, is truly complete. In the meanwhile, Oichi realizes that she, albeit unwittingly, neutralized N\u014dhime. She approaches her brother Oda, with an uneasy resolve to kill him if she cannot stop him. However, she cannot bring herself to kill him nor convince him to change his way. Yukimura and Masamune arrive in time only to see Oichi killed mercilessly by her brother for her hesitation. Then the big battle between Oda Nobunaga and Sanada Yukimura and Date Masamune begins. Two generals' relentless attacks are no match for the demon king's fearsome might. Oda smites Masamune with one of his attack and it worsens the already injured Masamune's condition to the point that he can barely resist Oda's grip. Just as Yukimura runs in to help, suddenly Honda Tadakatsu flies in and faces Oda instead to give time for Masamune to recover. He is killed but does significant damage to Oda's weapon. Yukimura thanks Honda Tadakatsu for his sacrifice with great sadness and wishes lord Tokugawa Ieyasu to honor his faithful retainer in afterlife. Masamune and Yukimura faces Oda one last time with an attack with every once of their power and successfully defeats Oda Nobunaga. After the battle, every state returned to their original state of battling against each other. The episode ends with Takeda Shingen battling against Uesugi Kenshin and Sanada Yukimura fight with his rival Date Masamune for supremacy.",

The two who revealed themselves to be serving Oda Nobunaga had arrived with a message for Motochika to seed Sanuki and Eao. When Motochika refuses both Maeda and Matsu prepared to attack, but instead Ch\u014dsokabe tells them about choosing the wrong lords to serve and mentioned Keiji, who was currently imprisoned in Aki at Itsukushima. Keiji is then confronted by Motonari for his reasons and Keiji replied for the two to meet of the hostage exchange for their spies and an alliance for Chosukabe and Mori of intent to attack Oda, but also reveal about Ch\u014dsokabe's new weapon, Fugaku, leading Mori to accept the meeting. Motochika then reveal Keiji's plan to Maeda and Toshiie and suggest to them to find their resolve, which after their meeting, led the two to no longer support Oda. The two sides later meet at sea, but Motonari tricked them as he got his men on Ch\u014dsokabe's possession killed and has the Fugaku surrounded and then demand that Ch\u014dsokabe abandons the Fugaku to him, which he refused. In anger and disbelief, Keiji then attacks Motonari but was his by an arrow and fell in the ocean, with Maeda and Matsu onboard the Fugaku watched in shocked and Ch\u014dsokabe in rage, leading the two sides to attack each other.

Knowing he would become a laughing stock if the family found out he was going out with an older woman, he hides her until the next morning.

        "In an elegant Spanish-style apartment building located at 4616 Melrose Place, in the trendy Melrose neighborhood of Los Angeles, a diverse group of 20-somethings have formed a close-knit surrogate family. Sydney Andrews is the landlady, still beautiful at age 40, and a central figure in the lives of all her tenants, especially handsome and rebellious David Breck. Sydney started an affair with David despite her turbulent history with his estranged father, Dr. Michael Mancini. Both father and son learned through experience that Sydney was not above using blackmail to control people. Another tenant, high-powered publicist Ella Simms, once considered Sydney her mentor, but their friendship was destroyed by betrayal, and Sydney threatened to evict Ella and ruin her career. Sydney also played a pivotal role in the career of Auggie Kirkpatrick. After they met at an AA meeting, she became Auggie's sponsor and encouraged his dream to become a chef. Now a successful sous chef at the trendy restaurant Coal, Auggie has been avoiding Sydney since she began drinking again. The other tenants include Lauren Yung, a medical student in desperate need of money to pay her student loans, and Jonah Miller, an aspiring filmmaker who has just proposed to his live-in girlfriend of five years, Riley Richmond, a first-grade teacher. The newest tenant, 21-year-old Oregon native Violet Foster, has just arrived in LA with her own secret connection to Sydney. When a bloody body is found floating in the courtyard pool, David is the leading suspect. However, as the police are soon to discover, almost everyone living at Melrose Place had a reason to want the deceased out of the way.",

Drew tries to stop Michael from performing a dangerous surgery, but Michael sets him up to get caught with drugs, causing the former to be thrown in jail, and out of ULA. Eventually, Drew reveals to Riley that he had a heart surgery five years earlier and had one of Michael Mancini's faulty heart valves put in due to a genetic heart problem... meaning he may die anytime. Lauren risks her job when she stops Dr. Mancini from another M-valve surgery by announcing his secret in front of his surgical team. Lauren and David reconcile, but a jealous Morgan finds out and seeks revenge by having her equally evil father blackmail David into performing robberies for him and also forces David not to tell Lauren about their secret agreement or she will be physically harmed. Meanwhile, Jonah asks Riley to reconcile after they attend an NYU reunion program, but she denies. Amanda is haunted by Sydney's illusion over the Ella situation. Eventually, Amanda accepts Ella's demands for a large severence pay, a WPK letter of recomondation, as well as erasing the false evidence of Ella's embezzlement. Ella then gives Amanda the stolen painting, who then sells it on the black market and makes $2 million in cash. The next day, when Ella shows up at WPK to collect, Amanda (not surprisingly) goes back on her word when she refuses to give Ella her severence pay and naturally denies making any secret deal. Just then, FBI agents arrive in Amanda's WPK office and arrest her after Ella (predicting exactly that Amanda would not keep her promise) informed them of the fraud Amanda committed (over the stolen painting) and the board of directors have now appointed Ella as Amanda's replacement as head of WPK. The audience is left unsure of all of the characters' fates at this point.

Lauren risks her job when she stops Dr. Mancini from another M-valve surgery by announcing his secret in front of his surgical team. Lauren and David reconcile, but a jealous Morgan finds out and seeks revenge by having her equally evil father blackmail David into performing robberies for him and also forces David not to tell Lauren about their secret agreement or she will be physically harmed. Meanwhile, Jonah asks Riley to reconcile after they attend an NYU reunion program, but she denies. Amanda is haunted by Sydney's illusion over the Ella situation. Eventually, Amanda accepts Ella's demands for a large severence pay, a WPK letter of recomondation, as well as erasing the false evidence of Ella's embezzlement. Ella then gives Amanda the stolen painting, who then sells it on the black market and makes $2 million in cash. The next day, when Ella shows up at WPK to collect, Amanda (not surprisingly) goes back on her word when she refuses to give Ella her severence pay and naturally denies making any secret deal. Just then, FBI agents arrive in Amanda's WPK office and arrest her after Ella (predicting exactly that Amanda would not keep her promise) informed them of the fraud Amanda committed (over the stolen painting) and the board of directors have now appointed Ella as Amanda's replacement as head of WPK. The audience is left unsure of all of the characters' fates at this point. As Amanda is taken away by the police to finally face justice for her vast list of crimes, she defiantly utters the final words of the show to Ella: \"You say you modelled your career after me, studied my every move? Well, then you know this war beteween us is just the beginning!!!\".",

        "After having a dream of herself as a child, reading a picture book titled The Black Flame and The Golden Wind before being saved from demonic creatures by a golden knight, Kaoru Mitsuki prepares for her debut tomorrow as an artist. Meanwhile, a man named Kouga Saezima just finished his training when his butler Gonza gives him a document that directs him to the art gallery Kaoru is at where a fiend called a Horror is located. After seeing the girl not to be possessed, he follows the frightened girl to the art dealer Tasuke Taniyama, offering to pay for one of Kaoru's pieces early and asking for the girl to take it to his manor. Once alone, Kouga attempts to kill Taniyama who runs off and put the entire building on lockdown. After taking out Taniyama's traps, with Kaoru in the crossfire, Kouga battles Taniyama until the demon possessing him, a woman-eating Horror named Anglay, bursts out of his host and uses another painting to assume another physical form. Telling Kaoru to run, Kouga transforms into the golden knight from Kaoru's dreams. Though Garo manages to kill the Horror, some of its blood splashes on Kaoru's face and arm.

Garo then climbs up, as Rei manages to snap him out of it before canceling the armor. Kouga thanks Rei for saving him from himself as the two proceed into the building."

The plan to prove Melanie is really Sam takes an unexpected turn when Melanie kisses Freddie, who then becomes extremely paranoid. Since Freddie refuses to believe it, Sam admits to Freddie that there is no Melanie. Satisfied, Freddie departs right before Melanie arrives to go to the mall with Sam and Carly. Meanwhile, Carly tries to tutor Chuck in math, and Spencer shows Carly how evil Chuck really is. Carly gets revenge on Chuck by telling him there's a new number called \"derf\" between 5 and 6, and because of this, Chuck fails his math test. Spencer gives Chuck's dad a brochure about a summer math camp he attended as a kid, called Camp Add-m-Up, sending Chuck to math camp for the whole summer. Notes: In this episode, Jennete McCurdy played both Sam and her twin sister, Melanie."
