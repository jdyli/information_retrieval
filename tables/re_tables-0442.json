Lupe and Sonja shop for wedding dresses and tell Sonja's son Brandon about the ceremony. He is excited and agrees to give Sonja away. Gregg and Dan discuss their families' conflicted feelings about two men getting married. Eve and Dale pick up their rings and search for a venue. Dale tells her parents about the ceremony and is hurt by her family's refusal to treat her wedding as equal to those of her siblings."

Their friends Dottie and Laura offer their back yard for the ceremony and, after facing discrimination in seeking another venue, they accept. Scott and Harley's friends, Tracey and Trent, agree to co-officiate their wedding. Harley is uncomfortable at the religious content of the ceremony Scott writes. The pair are going to couples counseling and Scott is also seeing a private therapist, which bothers Harley. Eve and Dale find a venue they love but Eve's parents back out of a promise to help pay for the wedding. Gregg and Dan discuss having children."
