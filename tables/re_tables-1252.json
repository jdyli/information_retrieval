On the other hand, Elena is back to Pueblo and begins to put her plan of revenge into action. A platoon of Spanish soldiers led by Juancho attacked the hideout of the native rebels.

Simeon thought that the only way to find out where Juancho hid his family is to threatening the commandant's wife Victoria.

The photographer Amon T. Joslin owned \"Joslin's Gallery\" located on the second floor of a building adjoining the Woodbury Drug Store, in Danville, IL. This was one of Lincoln's favorite stopping places in Vermilion County, Illinois, while he was a traveling lawyer. Joslin photographed Abraham Lincoln twice at this sitting. Lincoln kept one copy and gave the other to his friend, Thomas J. Hilyard, deputy sheriff of Vermilion County. Today, one original resides in the Illinois State Historical Library."

        "\"At the time I was [a young] clerk of the circuit court, and was about as well acquainted with Mr. Lincoln as with most of the forty-odd lawyers who practiced law in the circuit... On the opening day of court, which was always an interesting occasion, largely because we were curious to see what attorneys from a distance were in attendance...I observed that Mr. Lincoln was among them; and as I looked in his direction, he arose from his seat, and came forward and gave me a cordial hand-shake, accompanying the action with words of congratulation on my election. I mention this fact because the conduct of Mr. Lincoln was so in contrast with that of the other members of the bar that it touched me deeply, and made me, ever afterwards, his steadfast friend.\" \u2014C. F. Gunther of Chicago,circa 1896 Letter \"One morning I was in the gallery of Mr. Alschuler, when Mr. Lincoln came into the room and said he had been informed that he (Alschuler) wished him to sit for a picture. Alschuler said he had sent such a message to Mr. Lincoln, but he could not take the picture in that coat (referring to a linen duster in which Mr. Lincoln was clad), and asked if he had not a dark coat in which he could sit. Mr. Lincoln said he had not; that this was the only coat he had brought with him from his home. Alschuler said he could wear his coat, and gave it to Mr. Lincoln, who pulled off the duster and put on the artist's coat. Alschuler was a very short man, with short arms, but with a body nearly as large as the body of Mr. Lincoln. The arms of the latter extended through the sleeves of the coat of Alschuler a quarter of a yard, making him quite ludicrous, at which he (Lincoln) laughed immoderately, and sat down for the picture to be taken with an effort at being sober enough for the occasion. The lips in the picture show this.\" \u2014Mr. J. O. Cunningham,present when the picture was taken"

Mr. Lincoln, upon entering, looked at the camera as though he was unfamiliar with such an instrument, and then remarked: 'Well, do you want to take a shot at me with this thing?' He was shown to a glass, where he was told to 'fix up,' but declined, saying it would not be much of a likeness if he fixed up any.

Following the address, Lincoln, at the request of Gilmer, went to the portable canvas photo gallery of Calvin Jackson on the northeast corner of the square and sat for two ambrotype poses. The photos were soon processed, but one was not finished, probably because it had been overexposed.

Wilson had been commissioned to paint the president\u2019s portrait, but because Lincoln could spare so little time to pose, the artist needed recent photographs to work from. The pictures served their purpose, but the resulting painting- a traditional, formal, bust-length portrait in an oval format\u2014is not particularly distinguished and hardly remembered today.

        "Pacey and Joey return from their summer vacation on \"True Love\". Now they have to deal with Dawson's feelings, who has been deeply hurt over the past few months. At first, he doesn't want to talk with either one of them, but Jen convinces him to talk to Joey. Meanwhile, Pacey's older sister, Gretchen, arrives in Capeside and moves in with Doug, making Pacey homeless. He refuses to live with his parents anymore (going so far as to declare that he would rather sleep on death row), and after exhausting all other options, ends up back on his boat. Dawson tells Jack about his childhood crush on Gretchen. Andie meets two French boys, and she is attracted to both of them. Joey apologizes for hurting Dawson, but he tells her he isn't sure if he wants their friendship back. Everybody is wondering if Pacey and Joey had sex while on their trip, but both refuse to discuss it. However, when Dawson asks the same question, Joey tells him the answer wouldn't kill him, confirming that she and Pacey have not yet slept together."

An encouraged Apple Bloom goes off to follow Zecora to her home, and the others quickly follow once they notice her missing. They recover Apple Bloom just as she enters a field of blue flowers, where Zecora warns them off. The next day, Twilight and her friends find themselves suffering from strange problems, leading the others to conclude Zecora has cursed them. They find Apple Bloom missing again, and assume Zecora took her. They race to Zecora's hut and confront her, only to find her and Apple Bloom making a potion to cure them of the afflictions, which were caused by the Poison Joke flowers they had stepped in the day before.

        "The night of the Grand Galloping Gala in Canterlot has finally arrived. (\"At the Gala\" song) At the Gala, Twilight and her friends quickly separate to enjoy the Gala in their own ways, but each soon finds their experience fall well short of their expectations. As events mount, the friends' actions lead to a mass of chaos in the grand ballroom. They regroup later at a donut shop and express their disappointment with the night's events, but are soon joined by Princess Celestia, who explains that she had invited Twilight and her friends to liven up the normally boring Gala, and is happy with what happened. Everyone agrees the night to be the \"best night ever\". Featured songs \"At the Gala\" - lyrics by Amy Keating Rogers, composed by Daniel Ingram, orchestrated by Steffan Andrews, sung by Twilight Sparkle, Applejack, Fluttershy, Pinkie Pie, Rainbow Dash and Rarity (backed by the Gala guests)"

        "Rarity is in Canterlot to design a dress for Twilight's upcoming birthday. When members of the elite class snub her Ponyville background, she is convinced that she can demonstrate high fashion. She runs into another upper-class unicorn, Fancypants, who is more curious to her background, and invites her to a high class event. (\"Becoming Popular (The Pony Everypony Should Know)\") This soon builds to many more invitations to other fancy events for Rarity, leaving her torn between attending the events or finishing the half-completed dress. She decides to stay in Canterlot to mingle with the upper class and is surprised when Twilight and her friends arrive, having moved the birthday party to Canterlot. At Twilight's party, Rarity attempts to sneak out to a fancy garden party next door, but when her friends discover this, they decide to join the party as well. The upper class is initially shocked at their behavior, but Rarity stands up for her Ponyville friends.

However, this triggers a hoarding instinct in him, and the next day, Twilight is shocked to find he has grown larger. Twilight learns that as a dragon becomes more greedy, he will grow to larger and larger sizes. Spike's greed soon runs out of control, and as a giant dragon, he kidnaps Rarity and climbs a nearby mountain. When Spike sees Rarity wearing a fire ruby gemstone, he remembers when he had willingly given it to Rarity before his birthday. The generous thoughts reverse his growth, returning him to normal.

After a botched first attempt, their second tornado falls just short of the necessary speed. Twilight convinces Fluttershy to try to help. Fluttershy is able to dispel her fears long enough to give enough speed to complete the tornado. Rainbow Dash and the other pegasi cheer Fluttershy on as their hero.",

Rainbow Dash wants all the pegasi to improve their speed to beat the record, but finds that Fluttershy suffers from public anxiety from her time at flight school. Fluttershy tries to train on her own with her animal friends, and while she does improve, her performance is far worse than the other pegasi, and runs off.

Joey stays with her attacker, checking up on him and trying to get an ambulance to get him to the hospital.

Twilight and her friends talk with the brainwashed residents of the Empire, and learn of a Crystal Fair which used to enlighten the hearts of the Empire and protect it from the king. Only too late does Twilight realize that the missing Crystal Heart is the centerpiece of the fair and a necessary artifact to protect the city.

The pair pass several traps King Sombra had placed in the castle and eventually come to the Crystal Heart, just as Cadance's magic gives out and King Sombra races to reclaim the Empire. Twilight tries to get the Heart but becomes trapped; believing this would fail Celestia's test, she tells Spike to take the Heart. On his way down, Spike falls, but he and the Heart are saved at the last moment by Cadance and Shining Armor. The Crystal Ponies pour their emotions into the Heart, recreating the protective spell on the Empire and destroying King Sombra.

When Lightning Dust decides to create a tornado during a cloud-clearing exercise, the tornado threatens to harm Rainbow's friends, who have come by to give her a care package. Though everyone is safe in the end, Rainbow decides to quit the Wonderbolts, finding the organization's apparent approval of such reckless behavior morally abhorrent. However, Spitfire reveals that she agrees with her and persuades Rainbow to withdraw her resignation with a promotion to cadet team leader, stripping Lightning Dust of her rank."
