Despite this, they began a relationship and were soon very much in love. However, Sadie was keeping a secret from Jack; being that she was really Jayne Payton, the sister of former Starman Will Payton, and believed that Will was still alive. She was afraid that when she told Jack this, it would be the end of their relationship, but instead, because he loved her so much, Jack agreed to go to space to try and find Will Payton. Whilst Jack was in space, Sadie decided that if Jack was doing something for her, she should do something for him and took over his responsibility to help Jon Valor prove his innocence. This led to her becoming entangled in Nash's second crime wave in Opal City. Once this was over, and Jack returned to her, she discovered she was pregnant with his daughter and decided she had to leave, terrified by the violent life that Jack lived. After she had settled in San Francisco, she wrote to him and begged him to join her there, and, abandoning his role as Starman and taking his son with him, Jack did."

Eventually, Mikaal remembered how to speak English and gradually rediscovered his forgotten history."

When reborn in a more gentle and childlike temperament than usual, he relocated to Opal City's sewers, where he hid until Jack Knight went searching for him. Taking him back to Ted Knight to look after, Jack rechristened the gentle version Solly and he became almost a part of the Knight family. In particular, he built up a good relationship with previous Starman Mikaal Tomas. This relationship proved fatal for Solly, as he died saving Tomas' life. True to form, Grundy was reborn, but this version more resembled his previous incarnations, and the bond with the Knight family was broken as he went back to his criminal ways."

He earned the nickname \"Bobo\" (which he personally never cared for, but let Jack Knight alone use) and was eventually caught and imprisoned for his crimes. Upon his release, Bennetti found himself in an Opal City he both remembered and did not recognise, feeling old and out of place \u2014 something not helped by the fact that he had retained his 1960s fashion sense and dialect. Despite a promise to a woman that he would go straight, he considered robbing the Opal City bank and getting put back in prison, somewhere he at least understood. However, as he went in to rob the bank, he found that it was already being robbed by a gang of criminals. As Starman arrived, Benetti decided instead to help him capture the criminals. In gratitude, the bank offered him a job as their head of security. Later, when Jack Knight retired and the bank decided that Benetti was attracting criminals, he was given a career as one of Opal's new licenced superheroes."

At first attempting to keep to himself, he found himself warming to Opal's charms, and when the opportunity to leave presented itself to him, he decided instead to stay. Shortly before Jack Knight retired, he helped protect the city from Nash's second crime spree and registered with the Opal City Police as one of their officially recognised superheroes. He took over part of the responsibility for Opal when Jack retired."

Although Ralph has stretching super powers, it was primarily as a detective that his expertise was needed, and he leapt at the chance to help \u2014 especially once he found that he would be working alongside his personal hero, Hamilton Drew. Following Nash's second crime wave in Opal, Ralph and Sue promised Jack that they would stay on a little while in the city to help protect it, but told him that they were the restless, wandering types and would be unlikely to stay forever."

The inscriptions read \"NON SIBI SED PATRIAE / THE RESPONSE 1914\" inscription and \"QUO FATA VOCANT/ TO COMMEMORATE THE RAISING OF THE B COMPANY / 9TH BATTALION AND THE 16TH, 18TH AND 19TH SERVICE / BATTALIONS, NORTHUMBERLAND FUSILERS, BY THE / NEWCASTLE AND GATESHEAD CHAMBER OF COMMERCE AUGUST - OCTOBER 1914\" inscription The memorial comprises a granite base with a large group of figures on one side, all in bronze, and on the other side three figures carved from granite. The memorial is known by the name \"The Response\" and shows the men of Tyneside rushing to join the Colours. Other men follow carrying tools or rifles. Some of the men wear uniforms and other working clothes. Some of the men are saying goodbye to their families and others wave. Flags flutter above and a winged figure sounds a trumpet. One of the granite figures on the other side of the memorial is St George who is flanked by a soldier in the Northumberland Fusilier's unifom of the Great War period and another soldier who wears the uniform of 1674, the year the Regiment was formed. The unveiling took place on 5 July 1923 the ceremony being led by HRH Prince of Wales. The memorial was the gift of Sir George and Lady Renwick. It commemorated the contribution made to the war effort by the Northumberland Fusiliers, the safe return of the Renwick's five sons from the Great War and Sir George Renwick's 50 years of commercial involvement in the Newcastle Quayside.",

        "Much information on this Goscombe John work can be gleaned from The National Archives' files at their Kew offices. File WORK 20/105 covers the period November 1913 to August 1920 and gives us background information on the choosing of the site for the memorial and its design. The correspondence involves, amongst others, H.M.Office of Works, the War Office, the Committee of the Memorial to Lord Wolseley, Lady Wolseley, the Prime Minister\u2019s Office, and Goscombe John (many hand written letters written from his 24 Greville Road, St.John\u2019s Wood address). We read that it was a visit to Cardiff by the First Commissioner of Works that prompted him to suggest using Goscombe John to the memorials organising committee; He had seen Goscombe Johns' equestrian statue of Lord Tredegar there and was most impressed by it. The First Commissioner wrote \" This statue is certainly one of the most striking modern equestrian statues I have ever seen, and I think Goscombe John is well worthy of your consideration as a sculptor for the Wolseley Memorial\". We also learn that Lady Wolseley was involved in the choice of uniform which Wolseley would wear in the statue. The First Commissioner had suggested less formal wear ( \"the kind of garb he wore, say, during the Egyptian Campaign, or some active service kit.\") but Lady Wolseley preferred that her husband be shown in full Field Marshal\u2019s attire. It is also interesting to read that at one point Lady Wolseley wrote that many of Lord Wolseley\u2019s friends wished that Adrian Jones be given the commission. She talked in admiring terms of Jones\u2019 statue of the Duke of Cambridge (in Whitehall). She had seen a photograph of the Lord Tredegar statue but was not impressed with the representation of the horse. Later however we learn that Lady Wolseley had seen Goscombe John\u2019s model for the statue and had been happy with it. From another file, WORK 20/213, we learn that during the 1939-1945 war and after suffering bomb damage the statue was moved to Berkhampstead Castle in 1941 to avoid the risk of further damage and stayed there until 1949.",

It was the gift of Lady Webb.

The sitter served as a 2nd Lieutenant with the Welsh Guards during the First World War and was killed in December 1917. See entry above.

        "In the south nave vestibule of St Paul's is another Goscombe John work, this a memorial to the 207 men of the Coldstream Guards who lost their lives in the Second Boer War. Goscombe John's composition depicts two men of the Coldstream Guards. One man from the 1st Battalion is mortally wounded and lies dying in the arms of his comrade from the 2nd Battalion. Above these two is a group of Coldstreamers of former times watching proudly, as if in a vision, the bravery of their successors. Goscombe John includes the figure of General Monck, the first Colonel of the Coldstream Guards who is depicted on a horse. The other figures suggest campaigns in which the Regiment had seen service, including those of Marlborough, the Peninsula, Waterloo and the Crimea. In the background of the relief Goscombe John recreates the South African veldt, with distant kopjes, from behind which the setting sun floods both the landscape and the figures. Below the panel and on a riband is a Garter star (the regimental badge) and the motto 'Nulli Secundus'.",

He had an early success when he assassinated then-Starman David Knight. However, this led to a confrontation with his successor and brother, in which Jack Knight killed Kyle to ensure the safety of his father. Kyle returned later in the series as a ghost, having made his peace with the ghost of David Knight and asking for Jack's forgiveness for forcing him to commit murder. Jack's response is to wordlessly hug Kyle."
