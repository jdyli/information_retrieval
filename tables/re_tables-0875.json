        "When the Nighloks are revived and begin to attack the mortal realm, Jayden of the Shiba Clan takes arms to fight them as the Red Ranger. After defeating a company of Moogers, Jayden is informed by his mentor, Ji, that he must assemble his team of Samurai Rangers instead of fighting on his own. Meanwhile, on the Sanzu River, Xandred finally awakens, and upon learning that the Samurai Rangers still exist, becomes enraged and sends the Nighlok Tooya to attack the humans with an army of Moogers. Ji summons four other warriors: Olympic swimmer Kevin, kindergarten teacher Mia, carefree gamer Mike, and pure-hearted country-girl Emily. Upon meeting the four, Jayden gives each one a chance to back out of his crusade, and when all four decline, he gives each one a Samuraizer phone. Jayden, Emily, Kevin, Mia and Mike then take on Tooya and his numerous Moogers. Red Ranger defeats Tooya, but in spite of that, he tells his teammates to remain on their guard. Sure enough, the Nighlok is reborn as a mega monster, so the Samurai Rangers enlarge their Foldingzords to confront and destroy him. After the battle, Ji welcomes Emily, Kevin, Mia and Mike into the Shiba House and all five warriors become full-fledged Power Rangers.",

        "The Samurai Rangers are seen training, but Mike can't seem to sense Jayden or Kevin's attacks. Mike soon leaves practice to hang out with his friends, telling them of his struggles. However, the city is attacked by the Nighlok Rofer, sent by Xandred to raise the Sanzu River's water levels with human fear. Even in his Ranger form, Mike is no match for Rofer as the others arrive as the monster falls back to rehydrate. Jayden explains to Mike that being a Samurai Ranger is the ultimate sacrifice and must stay away from his friends and family to protect them. After giving it thought, Mike gets an idea and starts to train himself as Jayden undergoes his own training. The next day, when Rofer resumes his attack, Mike once again takes on the Nighlok on his own, tricking him into tangling up his arms. Mike then executes the finishing move. When Nighlok is revived and enlarged, despite Mike's intent to finish him off himself, the Rangers form their Megazord and use Jayden's training to finish the monster off.",

Kevin and Mia find the boy, only for the boy to refuse to answer them as he runs off. Following him to his home to learn whatever secret he has, the two get into a discussion of Kevin's personal regret of his life-long dream that he has been keeping to himself before Mia assures him he'll live his dream once Xandred is defeated. After an all-night stake out, Kevin and Mia find Ryan on the move as he suddenly disposes of his baseball stuff and calls Doubletone as he performs his end of the promise, hurting himself so he cannot play baseball in order to get his father back. However, as the garbage truck arrives to take out the trash, Doubletone revealed it to be a lie as part of his plan to make the boy cry to overflow the Sanzu River. Vowing to make the Nighlok pay, Kevin and Mia fight him as the others arrive, defeating Doubletone as he revives into a giant before Samurai Megazord destroys him. Later, the Rangers attend Ryan's game after the boy learns the garbage man saved his stuff and gave it to his coach, with Jayden using his Symbol Power to ease Ryan.",

Even with the Red Ranger's arrival, the team are no match for Dreadhead before he falls back when he begins to dry up.

The next day, a rehydrated Dreadhead resumes his attack with the other Rangers arriving to fight him as Jayden arrives and succeeds to using the Beetle Disc to have his Fire Smasher assume Cannon Blast Mode in order to destroy Dreadhead. When Dreadhead resurrects into a giant, he overwhelms Samurai Megazord until Jayden uses the Beetle Disc to summon the Beetle Zord. To counter the summoned giant Moogers, the Beetle Blaster Megazord is formed to take them out before destroying Dreadhead. After the fight, Jayden joins the others at the amusement park.",

        "During battle training, Emily accidentally injures Mike in the arm, Emily's attempts to care for his arm making a mess of everything. The Nighlok Negatron appears and subjects his victims to insults that hurt their feelings so deeply that the verbal abuse actually becomes a physical assault. Confronting him all the Rangers are struck down by Negatron's attacks save for Emily who is unaffected as the Nighlok is forced to retreat. When her teammates wonder about her immunity to Negatron's attacks, Emily tells them how her sister Serena taught her to ignore insults and how you need to keep thinking that the person never even said it. When Negatron resumes his attack, Emily succeeds in weakening him with Mike's help as Jayden destroys him with the five disc Beetle Cannon. Negatron revives as a Mega Monster and the Rangers destroy him with the Beetle Blaster Megazord. Later, the Rangers are then seen walking along the sidewalk while Mike carries Emily who lose consciousness at the end of the fight. Mia hears an ice cream truck and Emily, who has been faking unconsciousness for a few minutes at least, pretends to wake up so they can all get ice cream.

        "As Antonio heads to the samurai mansion, the others listen to Jayden and Ji talk of young Antonio-- How Jayden gave him the Octozord, how Jayden threatened to quit his training if Ji tried to take back the Octozord, etc.-- Antonio makes an entrance, fancy, then gets embarrassed when his fish hook rips his pants. Antonio explains that after moving away when he was a kid, he trained himself to be a samurai and built his Samurai-Morpher from a trashed cellphone to communicate with Octozord through text-- because the Zords understand the Rangers who were born into the Samurai heritage. Ji, feeling that Antonio lacks discipline and true samurai training confiscates Antonio's morpher, which he later doesn't react too well to. Jayden agrees with Mentor despite Antonio begs Jayden with memories of childhood friendship. As the Rangers fight the Nighlok Steeleto (who vows to avenge Vulpes), they're powerless to destroy it. Steeleto retreats when he starts to dry up and the team start to consider bringing Antonio along. Antonio, down at the fishing pier, angrily talks with Octozord about regretting meeting the Rangers. Emily and Mike go to ask him to join and go to the mansion. There, Jayden is convinced to give Antonio back his morpher just in time for the next attack by Steeleto. When the Rangers arrive, Antonio struggling to get in to a heroic position, they begin fighting and Steeleto is overpowered when Jayden and Antonio tag-team it. Once Steeleto mega-sizes, Antonio combines the Octozord with the Samurai Megazord and defeats Steeleto. To celebrate, Antonio cooks fish barbecue and everyone appreciates Antonio's membership.

While Antonio tries to work on the Black Box, the others Rangers recover, leave their ranger discs for Antonio to access the Black Box, and end up fighting a mutated Arachnitor. When Antonio cannot finish the Black Box, because he does not have enough strength to use any more symbol power, he instead locates Jayden and saves him right before Deker can duel Jayden. Though both weakened, Jayden and Antonio then join the others and they all manage to repel Arachnitor before the giant Moogers attack the city."

Devastated, Dayu escapes into the human world to fix it. Meanwhile the Rangers end up facing the Nighlok Rhinosnorus who traps Dayu, as well as Mia and Antonio in a dream world.

When joining martensitic stainless steels, cracks appear in the fillets on cooling (due to volume strain caused by martensitic transition of the base metal) and may reduce fatigue life of the joint; this can be prevented by a time-intensive stress relief heating just above the martensitic transition of the base metal, or by using BNi-1A, a reduced-carbon version, which reduces modulus of the filler alloy enough to prevent crack formation.",
