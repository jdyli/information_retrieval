Confirming her own feelings, Uzume meets up with Komachi again, proving that the dolls still regard Uzume as their master, and stands to fight against her.",
        "After returning Madeleine to Uzume, Komachi breaks a seal held on the dolls' memories, revealing that she was once their original master. Postponing the discussion concerning her motives til the next day, Komachi has the dolls stay at her place for the night, leaving Uzume restless. The next day, the girls and dolls meet up with Rafflesia and his partner Mikasa, who explain the origins of the Fantasista Dolls. Having been created by a company that soon got caught up in an international conspiracy, the cards and devices where given to various masters to test the dolls' ability to grow. It is also revealed that the one who came up with the idea for the cards was Kagami's brother, Makoto, who had been hiding in town as a character mascot the entire time. As Uzume feels she has many questions left unanswered, Komachi reveals she started the MDAG in the hopes of reviving Sonnet, a doll who was used as the basis for Proto-Zero, using the data Sasara and the others had gathered. Put under pressure by Komachi's request, Uzume is unable to convince Sasara to stay with her, leaving behind her cards and running off. As she leaves, she meets up with Anne, who tells her that dolls that have had their data extracted will lose all of their memories. Arriving home, Uzume finds a card and a note from the dolls, telling her to search for a 'birthday present'. Confirming her own feelings, Uzume meets up with Komachi again, proving that the dolls still regard Uzume as their master, and stands to fight against her."

        "Swami comments of Randeep & Rashmi's relationship, which starts a fist-fight between Swami & Randeep. After the fight, Rashmi tries to tell them that they have to work together. They disagree & decide to work separately & asks Rashmi to choose. She thinks about it, but before she can answer Randeep asks her to work with Swami & he walks away. Randeep goes to Al's old office to check on things left behind. He finds a notepad & finds some imprints. As he leaves, a bomb blows up the whole place. He shows the note to an expert, who shades over & finds two lines in Arabic, the language of Lisiya. It translates to, \"Victory will be ours. Common man will die\". Rashmi, Swami & Ehsaan go to the Sea View hotel to get the CCTV recordings. Swami & Ehsaan create a diversion & Rashmi gets all the videos related to Bidisha, Al, Sameer & the actual killing. Shahana goes to Rashmi's building & keeps an eye on Mithoo. She then meets one of her old henchman & asks him to get details about 2613 & tell him that she wants to get involved. Al talks to Sameer & tells him that they have to wait till the situation cools down. Sameer meets a politician regarding an old deal they made years ago. He refuses at first & says that the money is not enough. Sameer warns him that they will not leave him if he backs off. He finally agrees, when Sameer offers him double the money."

During the meeting, he asks Swami to stop following Sameer & arrest Randeep & Rashmi. He also promises a promotion. When Swami is hesitant, he says that if he fails to follow the order, he will be fired from SIU. Swami agrees to the offer & tells him that he will bring them to him in 2 hours.
