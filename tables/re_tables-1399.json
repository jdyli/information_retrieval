        "Alice finds herself in a serious bind when she's called by Colonel Davis to testify on behalf of the U.S. Army against Tasha. Alice must decide whether to tell the truth about her romance with Tasha, or lie and risk facing charges of perjury. While testifying, Alice goes on the offensive and inadvertently strikes a nerve when she says that anyone, even Col. Davis, could be deemed gay by association. Col. Davis, fearful of Alice's new platform to out people on The Look, offers Tasha a deal in exchange for Alice's discretion. Tasha, however, chooses to unequivocally state her love for Alice, ending her military career. Meanwhile, Jenny continues her romance with Niki just as Niki's managers push into full-force damage control after photos of Niki's oil wrestling stint are posted in numerous tabloid magazines and internet sites. When one of Niki's movies opens, Tina and the producers ban Jenny from attending as Niki's date, and force Greg, the young male actor playing Jim, to accompany Niki to the premiere. Jenny asks Adele to sneak her into the theater, but the increasingly manipulative Adele instead uses her time inside without Jenny to network with many people about the movie. Across town, Bette and Tina's anguish over hiding their secret tryst begins to get to both of them emotionally as Jodi continues to slowly drift away from Bette, while Tina invites the Lez Girls cinematographer, Samantha, over for dinner at Jodi's house. Elsewhere, Molly continues to resent Phyllis' action concerning her divorce, and Shane tries to get Molly to see her mother in a more positive light.",

Silk offers to give up her body so that Makoto can live once the monster is defeated, and asks UFO-man to erase any memory of her from Makoto. She then goes to fight the monster, which she defeats after destroying its core. However, she hesitated before destroying it, and didn't hurt Makoto very much, so UFO-man used his power to repair Makoto instead. Makoto decides to not go to America after all, and gives her a picture he took of her while she was transformed."

        "As the Simpson family is driving home after spending the day at a ghost town tourist attraction, Grampa needs to use the restroom but Homer refuses to stop the car. Grampa is forced to hold his urine in for hours and as a result his kidneys explode. With not much time left for Grampa to live, Homer offers to give his father one of his kidneys. However, he runs away from the hospital out of fear of the procedure and decides to hide, feeling shame for leaving Grampa at the operating table. He joins a group of weird characters on a ship who are also hiding out of shame for things they have done in their lives. However, Homer is rejected even from these outcasts because they are angered and disgusted by what he has done to his father. They throw him into the ocean and he drifts back to Springfield. There, he plans on giving his kidney again, but runs away at the last minute once more. After being knocked out by a car while fleeing from the hospital, Homer unwittingly gives his kidney while unconscious.",

        "Alice walks in on Jenny and Shane after their night of passion, and naturally does not hesitate to gossip about it to everyone she knows before they have a chance to explain. Meanwhile, Tina gets into trouble when the film negatives for the movie The Girls (which the producers changed from \"Lez Girls\"), have been stolen from the studio and Tina gets blamed by her boss, Aaron, because of her frustation over the movie's new ending. Tina thinks Jenny stole them, but Jenny denies it. But the real unseen culprit soon frames Tina for the theft by sending a ransom note e-mail from Tina's office computer.

As she prepares to kill her victim, she steps on the tack, stabs her foot and falls from the building to her death.

Soon, Trevor enacts a policy of 'complete openness', installing cameras all across Bregna and giving him ultimate control over the people. But Gildemere, a Breen soldier loyal to Clavius, is plotting against the new Chairmen, guessing rightly that Trevor was the mastermind behind the kidnapping. Trevor\u2019s reasons for the coup are two-fold; he gains ultimate power in Bregna, and uses Clavius\u2019 body to create an isolated place, locked with a strange ornate key, where he can keep \u00c6on for good, keeping her to himself in perfect privacy. \u00c6on, for her own reasons, allies with Gildemere and finds her way 'into' Clavius, confronting Trevor and leading Gildemere to his leader, allowing him to free Clavius from Trevor\u2019s captivity: however Clavius is revealed to be completely insane and Gildemere is forced to kill him. He and \u00c6on then fight and she easily overpowers him. Trevor finds them both near the walled frontier and Gildemere condemns Trevor as a traitor.

As they do, Trevor uses his tongue to open up \u00c6on's fake tooth and place a rolled up picture inside. After the two of them part, \u00c6on spies an industrial vehicle driving past. \u00c6on then retrieves the picture from her tooth to find it is a photo of a fellow passenger, and a suitcase. She climbs out and moves along the side of the plane to spy on the man, who is reading documents from the same suitcase. \u00c6on must jump mid-air to the back of the plane to get inside, but she misses and falls. Realising her fate, \u00c6on prepares to shoot herself, but distracted by the industrial vehicle from earlier stopping at the edge of a cliff. The workers pull at ropes to bring something to the surface while an intrigued \u00c6on struggles to keep her binoculars at her eyes from the air resistance. She notices a bridge near the point where she will land, and shoots her grapple at it. At the same time Trevor's train is passing over the bridge and inside he is kissing his Breen lover. While she swings from the rope \u00c6on is again distracted by the men salvaging the object which is obscured from view by the cliff, but is glowing brightly. \u00c6on's distraction leads the rope to loop around her neck. A moment before she can clearly see what the object is, her neck is snapped.",

She handcuffs him, but drops the floor number attached to the key, leaving her no choice but to go down from level to level. On each floor, \u00c6on shoots up the stairwell to keep a pursuing Breen soldier at bay, tests the key on that floor's locker and shoots a distant sky hook that is attempting to latch on to the railing of a small, distant, water level platform. Each time she exits the lift, Trevor and the red-clothed agent make love, with the agent springing back to either guard Trevor or try to retrieve the number. \u00c6on begins to suspect and sets a trap, exposing the agent\u2019s weakness. The agent attacks and apparently kills \u00c6on as she advances, then comes out on the correct floor for the key and finds an odd plug-shaped object in the locker; not knowing what it is for, she discards it. Without \u00c6on to keep him at bay, the Breen guard runs down to the small platform, killing Trevor on the way, and helps the sky-hook get a grip on the platform's railing. Just before the red-clad agent reaches them, the sky-hook lifts up the entire platform, revealing an identical 'plug' attached below it. The base sinks and the agent is left stranded."

        "This episode focuses on a massive battle between the leather-clad, dark-haired Monicans and the Aryan soldiers of Bregna, with \u00c6on Flux in the thick of battle. During the course of the battle, \u00c6on cuts down dozens of guards before she is knocked down by a Breen guard who had been playing dead. \u00c6on sees another Monican agent creeping up on the guard and keeps him distracted with alluring tongue movements. But the Breen sees the agent and kills him and \u00c6on. The Breen makes his way into the battle, slaughtering dozens more attackers, and encounters a long-haired, super-fit Monican agent (called Romeo Svengali in the DVD commentary) with a sword. The Breen tries to shoot the agent down, but the bullet is deflected and the Monican kills the Breen. We then follow the Monican as he opens a way into a heavy-duty prison and heads up into a Breen airship, killing more soldiers before being shot in the chest. The track then switches to a redhead female Breen agent who infiltrates the base and frees someone who seems to be her lover from his cell. They run, pursued by guards, but are heading towards a pool of grease started when the Monican opened the gate...",
