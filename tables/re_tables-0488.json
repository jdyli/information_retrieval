A man's body is pulled from the canal, with \u00a36000 in cash and a list of numbers on him, but no identifying papers. Tasked to work with former sergeant and good friend Maureen Lawson, Frost's investigations reveal not one, but two, separate lives that he led, and how he financed them. Meanwhile, at a local fridge recycling holding site, a dismembered man's body is found in one of fridges. All the body parts fit together, except that he has two left feet - could he be linked to the local ballroom dancing scene? Frost's investigation leads him into the competitive world of ballroom dancing and Miss Dolores Delmonte, whose search for perfection in her partners goes to alarming lengths.",

        "Christmas 1999. Frost and Dorridge are called to investigate the murder of a young regional crime squad police detective, Tim Fox. Frost wonders if Fox's death is really related to the large investigation he was working on to uncover a car theft gang, or if an affair between the deceased's wife and one of his colleagues could also hold a motive for murder. Meanwhile, a local power station worker, Cocroft, is burgled. Shortly afterward, he falls to his death in a mysterious accident. Nothing is suspect, until new WPC Susan Kavanagh establishes a link between the burglary and a series of pet shootings. As Frost and Dorridge continue to try to identify detective Tim Fox's killer, his colleague, DI Newcombe, protests his innocence - but Frost is sure he is responsible for the killing. Meanwhile, WPC Kavanagh links a series of other local burglaries to the pet shootings - and a further incident in which a woman's car is tampered with, causing her to have a serious accident - also appears to fit into the picture. Forced to seek help from Kavanagh's new computer system, Frost uncovers the real identity of Tim Fox's killer - whilst she goes to investigate two young men working at the power station to question them about the burglaries, shootings and attempted murder. She soon, however, finds herself in grave danger - and Frost's pursuit leads to a confrontation above the power station.",

After the eventual explosion, Adam used the high-speed camera footage to help him in his calculations, which revealed that the unobstructed water heater shot up feet (m) at an initial speed of miles per hour (km/h), which was near their estimates in their original test."

The lowest level housed the 52-US gallon water heater, the second level a set simulating a living room, and on top a roof built to standard California building codes. The resulting explosion from the water heater did cause it to shoot through the living room floor and the roof, landing on the metal scaffold next to the house model. It was deemed plausible because, unlike the original myth, the show did not mention any documented events of water heater explosions in two-story houses."

        "For this test, Grant built a pan hammer robot to simulate an object being smashed on the counter. Four heads using a mold of Kari's bust were then made, three made of ballistics gel, each with a skull and brain matter analog inside, and one completely made of ice. In the two control tests, the ice head shattered while the ballistics gel head in room temperature only had its front part broken. The test for the one dipped into liquid nitrogen for five seconds showed a result seemingly in between the two control tests: parts of the head did shatter, but not completely. To achieve the results shown in the film, the third head had to be dipped in the liquid nitrogen for five minutes. To really simulate human flesh and bone, the myth was then retested using two pigs' heads. The head dipped for only five seconds merely had its snout flattened while the one submerged for fifteen minutes did not even shatter, completely busting the myth. In a related test not aired in the actual episode but shown on the MythBusters website, Kari made an ice sculpture of a pig's head. The pan hammer only broke off the snout of the ice head; the rest of the head was shattered after it fell off the table."

The surrogate snowplow travelled a total distance of feet (m) and struck the car at a speed of miles per hour (km/h), completely splitting it along its length with a thrust of pounds (N). Afterwards, the wedge disintegrated when the rocket sled slammed into a concrete barrier behind the car. The Build Team still regarded the myth as busted because an average motorist is highly unlikely to encounter a snowplow traveling with enough speed to destroy a car in this manner."

However, they were unable to get consistent data because the three archers they tested all rode at different speeds, fired their arrows at different distances, and had varying arrow velocities. For a more conclusive test, the Build Team obtained a Jeep and mounted a crossbow on the top. They then fired arrows at a large foam target while stationary and then while the Jeep was driving at miles per hour (km/h), in both cases from a fixed distance of feet (m). While the arrows fired while the Jeep was moving did penetrate deeper into the target, they did not penetrate twice the distance of the arrows fired while stationary, busting the myth."

However, they found that, unlike in the commercial, the car would not fall evenly and would hit the ground front first. They solved this problem by evenly distributing the weight of the car. For the actual test, the Build Team dropped a car from a helicopter while a remote controlled car drove at miles per hour (km/h) in an attempt to beat it. However, because the car could only achieve a top speed of miles per hour (km/h), the Build Team had to shorten the ground distance to feet (m) to compensate. During the actual experiment, the falling car managed to beat the ground car. This, taking into account many other factors of the experiment, prompted the Build Team to bust the myth."

They then placed all of the barrels on the right side of the bus and performed a right hand turn at 50 miles per hour. The bus barely managed to make the turn but successfully managed not to flip over. They then performed a second test with the weight evenly distributed in order to confirm the first test, but the bus failed to flip, proving that weight distribution was not necessary and busting the myth. In order to flip the bus, Adam and Jamie distributed all of the weight to the outside of the bus to shift the center of gravity, added steel weights to the roof to make it top heavy, and added a valve to deflate the left side air-suspension to further shift the weight of the vehicle."

He was found gagged and the pathologist determines he had been chloroformed and had choked on his own vomit. He had also had his left pinkie finger cut off. The police had initially thought the young boy was Bobby Kirby who had gone missing that evening, but they determine it's not the same child so they have both a murder victim and a missing child. The same evening, a couple returns home to find their front door open and their teenage daughter missing. The parents paid 25,000 pounds for her release but Frost has his doubts having had business with the girl's father in the past. As for Bobby, kidnappers demand a half million pounds from a major supermarket chain or the boy will be killed. The payment is made but the police operation is botched and they have to go back a few steps in order to get on the right track.",

        "Just back from a holiday in Spain with his friend Kitty Rayford, Frost investigates the death of Jeanette Barr, found on a nearby riverbank. The autopsy reveals that although she drowned, it more likely happened in her bathtub and not in the river.

Eager to please Lucy, Lee follows the campaign's advice and discovers something he wasn't expecting. Lee promises he'll check his testicles but is later worried when speaking to Tim about his problem and finally convincing him to see his testicles, he convinces him to tell Lucy but Lee doesn't and lies to her that everything was fine. After being examined by Tim, Lee then visits his doctor, but is put off by the fact that she is female. Lee and Tim then go to a sauna, to look at men's testicles, but it doesn't go as planned. Lucy convinces Lee to re-visit the doctor after she finds him on a gay porn site when trying to see average testicle sizes, at first thinking he is gay. He agrees, but realises the male doctor is one of the men from the sauna. Additional material: Simon Evans, Paul Kerensa, Liam Woodman, David Isaac, Dave Cohen, Simon Griffiths"

        "Adam and Jamie took a car out to a quarry and set it up on chocks. But before Adam could put a weight on the gas pedal, the car started rolling over the edge. It only made it past the first few ledges of the cliff, and didn't explode. The second car was raised by a forklift so they could get it up to speed. then set it on the ground. The car crept towards the edge because Jamie had left the parking brake on. Crashing unspectacularly, this car didn't explode either. Adam and Jamie discovered why: the gas tank is put on the underside of the car and between the wheels, intentionally out of harm's way. The MythBusters dropped a -pound (kg) weight directly on the gas tank to simulate the car landing on a rock and flattening the gas tank. The result was the kind of fireball seen in the movies. Adam and Jamie attached the gas tank to the front of a car, drove it over the cliff, and caught the car on fire. It still wasn't the kind of fireball from the movies, though. So, with Frank Doyle's help, Adam and Jamie loaded another car up with explosives, drove it off a ramp and over a cliff, and watched it crash perfectly like in the movies. Frank's method was the one mostly used by filmmakers. Adam then stated that, for once, Hollywood didn't exactly bend the laws of physics; they just turned a one-in-a-million shot into a one-in-one shot."

One is arrested but the other, Roman Cassell, gets back to his office where,the next day, he is found beaten to death. Suspicion falls on Jason Cohu and his father-in-law Joshua Ray, who blame Cassell for the death of Jason's wife and were in the vicinity of the office that night. Joshua admits to the murder but Frost believes he is innocent, misguidedly protecting his son-in-law and CCTV footage proves him right.

Because the lorry's mechanism was faulty he was acquitted of dangerous driving but the Heals are not happy and Andy Heal goes to the bus depot for a confrontation. Later the driver and his conductress are abducted from their bus. The conductress is diabetic and needs her insulin shots and, after a television appeal, she is dumped, alive, in town, not far from an alley where a clown is found dead.

He noted that it was more difficult to get the duct tape to stick underwater, but successfully patched the leak.

The super pykrete proved to last significantly longer, prompting Adam and Jamie to use that as their main building material. The MythBusters then built a full-size boat out of the super pykrete, dubbing it Yesterday's News, and subjected it to real world conditions. Though the boat managed to float and stay intact at speeds of up to miles per hour (km/h), it quickly began to spring leaks as the boat slowly melted. At twenty minutes in with the boat deteriorating, the experiment was pulled, and the boat lasted another ten minutes while being piloted back to shore. Though the boat worked, it was noted that it would be highly impractical for the original myth, which predicted that an entire aircraft carrier could be built out of pykrete. They agreed to settle on a \"plausible but ludicrous\" conclusion."

        "Guy is taking Lucy on a surprise holiday, and buys her lots of expensive \u2013 and revealing \u2013 clothes. Lee gets suspicious when a suspect package is delivered to Guy, and assumes that Guy is a gangster. However, when confronted, Guy claims it was only his passport. Lee and Tim break into Guy's office and discover several precious stones \u2013 presumably diamonds \u2013 in the package. Guy admits that it wasn't a passport he had delivered, but claims that the 'diamonds' are actually sapphires which he was making into a necklace for Lucy. Still suspicious, Lee steals one and has it valued, confirming that it is a diamond. The surprise holiday is revealed to be to Sicily. When Guy and Lucy go to the airport, Barbara warns Lee and Tim that Sicily is famous for gangsters, and that Guy is using Lucy to smuggle the diamonds abroad. Lee and Tim run to the airport and confront Guy, but he explains that the sapphires are real, and that the diamond is the only one \u2013 and has been made into an engagement ring. Guy asks Lucy to marry him, but Lee asks her to say no \u2013 he may not be a gangster, but he is still not right for her. Lee returns to the flat alone, but Lucy later returns, saying she refused Guy as he was too controlling, and their relationship is over. Final appearance of Guy. Daisy is absent from this episode.",

        "The Build Team acquired a bus with the same dimensions as that used in the film, then built a small-scale model of both it and the stretch of road in question. Running at a calculated speed of miles per hour (km/h), the bus plunged off the end of the road and crashed into the support posts at ground level on the other side. When the gap was halved, the bus still dropped far enough to hit the far end of the roadbed head-on. The team theorized that hidden ramps placed on either end of the gap may have helped the bus to make its jump safely. After outfitting their full-size bus for remote-control steering on an airfield, they did a speed test and found that it could go up to miles per hour (km/h), rather than the miles per hour (km/h) depicted in the film. With the 50-foot target distance scaled down to allow for the lower top speed, they jumped the bus off a ramp; it fell far short of the target, but remained relatively intact until it hit a concrete safety barricade. Since the bus could not make the jump, the team declared the myth busted."

Wallace's first case is a man found hanged in his home. She suspects the death was not suicide. A set of fingerprints at the scene belong to an unidentified man discovered drowned a year previously. Frost is summoned by Supt Mullett to sort things. He connects a painting that appears to have been stolen from the hanged man with an art robbery and murder several years earlier. There is a timeline discrepancy between Series 4, 5 and 6. The events in \"Appendix Man\" are hinted to take place about a month after Clive Barnard's death at the end of \"No Other Love\", and about a year after the events in \"Dead Male One\". The episodes were actually broadcast two years and four years apart respectively. Several allusions to then-current events in other episodes of Series 6 indicate that the whole of Series 6 actually took place in late 1998. The discrepancies were never resolved.",

Frost is summoned by Supt Mullett to sort things. He connects a painting that appears to have been stolen from the hanged man with an art robbery and murder several years earlier. There is a timeline discrepancy between Series 4, 5 and 6. The events in \"Appendix Man\" are hinted to take place about a month after Clive Barnard's death at the end of \"No Other Love\", and about a year after the events in \"Dead Male One\". The episodes were actually broadcast two years and four years apart respectively. Several allusions to then-current events in other episodes of Series 6 indicate that the whole of Series 6 actually took place in late 1998. The discrepancies were never resolved.",

        "Pauline Venables has been running a successful party store in Denton with her sister Sue, but the siblings don't get on as well as they should. Their little world changes when Pauline brings home Karl Edwards, a divorced ex-con and announces he will be moving in after they are married. Sue resents him as an interloper interested only her sister's money. Sue's resentment can be traced back to an earlier incident when she found her then husband and Pauline in bed. Looking to make amends to her sister, Pauline decides to have Linda, a shop employee, take her to a deserted farmhouse to buy Sue a Labrador puppy for her birthday, something she's always wanted. Things go awry when Pauline is brutally kidnapped by Linda's accomplice, sociopath Graham McCardy, who binds Pauline and demands \u00a330,000 in ransom... or else.",

He is convinced that they have the culprits in custody but is frustrated by the limits placed on his ability to gather evidence. He also looks into an attack on the very pretty Helen Tudor who was pushed down the stairs at her university. She has no idea who may have pushed her but had recently rebuffed a professor, Dr. Michaelson, who had a reputation for getting too \"close\" to his students. In the course of the investigation, Frost learns that a woman very similar in appearance to Helen drowned some two years previously, even though she was a very good swimmer. Clive Barnard, now a DS in Boxborough, assists Frost in locating a possible suspect, a student who knew both girls. Frost finally finds himself a flat but also gets some unexpected lodgers.",

Each member took three shots, moving up to yards (m) after Tory went first. Although several bullets nicked the blade or handle, none split on it until Tory tried again with a stand at the shorter distance. With one bullet hole appearing on either side of the blade, the team declared the myth confirmed and decided that a person could consistently make the 40-yard shot with enough practice. In addition the expert then proceeded to show the 40-yd.-shot standing, cleanly bursting two balloons located to the left and right of the axe blade."

        "The Mythbusters first performed several small scale tests, using a model car and a wind tunnel, and found that at higher speeds, a sort of air bubble seemed to form around the driver compartment, giving credence to the myth. In their full scale test, they used an actual convertible as well as a rain bar to provide the rain. In the control test, they stopped the convertible in the middle of the rain to put up the top, but the interior was still soaked. They then drove through the rain at mph (km/h), and saw that the interior was significantly less soaked than the control. They then drove the car through the rain at mph (km/h) and saw that the interior was not soaked at all. The Mythbusters attributed this to the car's windshield, which served its function as well as creating an air bubble. However, they decided to declare the myth \"Plausible, but not Recommended\", due to the inherent danger of driving at such high speeds on wet roads."

        "As is usually the case, there's a lot on Frost's plate these days. He's been assigned a new officer, DS Terry Reid, who has been transferred somewhat abruptly after investigating a university student for selling contraband cigarettes. He has other problems as well, as Frost soon learns, but generally he is a good copper. Their first case is that of a woman, eventually identified as Sylvia Carter, whose remains are found on the railroad tracks after being run over by several trains. She worked for a local sandwich maker and Frost is convinced she was having an affair with someone. Dr. Helena Gibson, a senior surgeon at the local hospital in Denton, goes missing over a weekend. From all accounts she was in on Saturday but didn't show up at a colleague's house for lunch on Sunday. She was brilliant in her field but was disliked by virtually everyone at the hospital so there is no shortage of possible suspects if in fact anything is amiss... Having solved the death of Sylvia Carter, Frost now focuses on the murder of Dr. Gibson, whose corpse was found in a plastic bag in a truckload of medical waste. According to the pathologist, she was killed with a blow to the head from a blunt instrument. Many at the hospital didn't like the woman including the hospital administrator, Jameson and several members of her surgical team including Dr. Retnick from whom she was demanding a letter of resignation. She had also recently had a run-in with a parent whose young son inexplicably died in post-operative care. In fact, there is an investigation into an abnormally large number of post-operative deaths at Denton General but as Frost learns, everyone who dies seems to have done so while occupying bed 5. DS Reid is in hospital having been beaten in a public washroom. Frost is certain it has to do with his earlier investigation of Tim Hamilton...",
