As Nathan and Andrew were the current holders of immunity, they were the first to play. AJ asked them who they wanted to play against, and they chose the green team. Immediately, the green team Mates took the wooden spoon and won. The light blue team withdrew and the green team were then asked who they wanted to play against next. For the rest of the rounds, despite some players \u2014 such as Cameron \u2014 wanting the food and a chance for immunity, everyone else refused to take the spoon, and as a result, Ben & Sean won immunity having eaten just 70 calories. Also, since Mel and Sharif were with the Commando, Holly and Teresa represented themselves without their partner. The other couples had all expressed a desire to go for immunity in order to take it from Nathan & Andrew. But, as they discovered that Nathan & Andrew no longer had it, and so as not to take in unnecessary calories, they stood firm and didn't give in to temptation.
