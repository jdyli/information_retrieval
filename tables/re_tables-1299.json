As the pair are forced to interrogate her tight knit community, they receive information from a witness who places one of the opposition's sons down by the river, disposing of a gun shortly after the incident. But when the witness is found dead in similar circumstances, Dalziel suspects that someone is playing him at his own game. Things turn from bad to worse when the initial suspect is lured to a factory owned by the Asian girl's father, shortly before it goes up in flames \u2013 taking him with it. As the dirty side of local politics begins to rear its ugly head, Pascoe is tied up with his new relationship with the local pathologist - although his initial fears of an affair prove to be the key turning point of the complex investigation.",

With his parents having also been targeted, Dalziel suspects that the killer is someone who is against the campaign, and is trying to prevent Declan from continuing with it.

        "Dalziel and Pascoe investigate the disappearance of a young girl eight years ago, when another girl disappears in mysterious circumstances. The initial suspect at the time of the first investigation was Benny Lightfoot, a local farmhand who himself vanished shortly after the girl's disappearance. And when graffiti in the words of 'Benny's Back' appears close to the site of the recent disappearance, Dalziel suspects that he may be back to strike again. However, all is not as it seems, as the little girl's companion, Tighe the dog, leads Wieldy right to her body, buried inside a small cave on Beulah Height. As each and every one of the local's lives come under scrutiny, the discovery of Benny Lightfoot's corpse beneath the remains of a sunken house prove to be the final clue in identifying the killer. Meanwhile, Pascoe has to deal with family grief as his daughter is rushed to hospital with meningitis.",

Having investigated the original case himself alongside his former boss, Wally, Dalziel is immediately told to stay away from the case, and instead, a high-flying DCI from London, Hillier, is brought in to lead the case. Unhappy with the decision, Dalziel decides to do a little investigating of his own, and manages to obtain papers on the case which Hillier is looking for. However, he soon realises that Hillier is prepared to stop at nothing when he arrives home to find his house trashed, as if someone was looking for the papers. Meanwhile, as Koler is released, she is informed that James Westropp, thought dead since 1968, is still alive, and after a little persuasion from an old friend with a grudge, decides to hunt him down to finish him off.",

        "Housewife Susan Goodman is poisoned to death whilst in the course of doing her weekly shopping. Initially suspected as a terrorist attack, Dalziel and Pascoe soon discover that for some bizarre reason, someone had motive to kill this innocent woman.

The funding from across the border is allegedly being routed through Jammu & Kashmir Affectees Relief Trusts (JKART), a frontal organization of HM. Lali was arrested on 4 September 2013 from his native Ajas area in Bandipora district of Jammu and Kashmir, following a brief shoot out with security forces. The operation was carried out jointly by the state police and the Rashtriya Rifles, who had launched a cordon and search operation in Ajas area that morning, after receiving information that HM militants were present there.",

Afterwards, Staz suggests that he enroll as a transfer student at Fuyumi's high school and they run into her upset father but Staz sprays him with his diluted saliva altering his behavior and explaining that it possesses the property of controlling humans. later, Staz enters into a fit of excitement while marveling at the human world, and upon arriving at Fuyumi's school, sprays its entire population with his saliva thus allowing her to fit in as if she never left. Fuyumi soon learns that the chemical only creates false memories, at which point, her body starts disappearing much to her shock.

He further explains to Wolf that ghosts have the unique ability of becoming a single demon species by absorbing their magic; digressing that if Fuyumi absorbs all of Staz's magic she may be able to rival another demon. Back in Acropolis, Braz learns of Staz's arrival and the Blood family reunites, with the former refusing to help Staz. After a little sibling rivalry involving Liz's envy of Braz's preference to Staz, Braz proposes Staz with a deal. Meanwhile, Bell reveals to an angered Wolf of Franken's hidden intention of using Fuyumi to combat a failed experiment called Artificial Demon No. 9: Akim Papradon, a monstrosity he created using bodily pieces of other demons. Seeking stronger parts however, Akim escaped from Franken's laboratory and began hunting demons. Wolf makes a deal with Franken that should he defeat Akim, he would return Fuyumi to being a regular ghost. Simultaneously, Braz explains the same matter to Staz, proposing to teach him the resurrection spell should he help defeat Akim, which the latter refuses. Braz continues that after unlocking Staz's tremendous magic power via his experiments, he was forced to seal it until a time when Staz could properly wield it. Refusing to have the seal removed, Braz has Liz's zombies beat Staz to the point of having to use his true power. Meanwhile, with Bell's help, Wolf arrives at the North District in his search for Akim and engages in a battle with the territory's boss. However, much to Wolf's horror, Akim suddenly appears by grotesquely ripping through the boss. Finally, as the zombies overwhelm Staz, Braz removes the bullet seal, awakening Staz's true power and thus allowing him to easily eradicate the zombies. In the epilogue, Braz picks up the crushed boulder from the ground after telling Liz not to loose it, being a reminder of Staz's true power.",

Meanwhile, Wolf and Akim engage in fierce hand to hand combat, with the former supposedly emerging victorious after using his claws to slice Akim to pieces. At the same time, Staz shows up just as Akim starts putting his body back together and enters the battle by knocking Akim into the northern wasteland before switching with Wolf, whose magic completely depletes.

Insulted, Staz releases his magic which takes the form of a large golden hand and annihilates Akim in one powerful attack. In the attack's wake, Staz allows Akim to piece himself back together, admitting that his power is a burden before seemingly killing Akim with his ZIP spell. Afterwards, Wolf approaches Staz and challenges him to a battle.

        "Heads Hydra\u2014master of the Hydra Territory confronts Staz. Meanwhile Deku, Yoshida and Mamejir\u014d face the Tropical Territory who intend to conquer Staz's territory in his absence. Heads explains that after Neyn was formed, she along with himself and Fuyumi's father\u2014Yanagi met to discuss their circumstances. Eventually Yanagi gave up Neyn to Heads in exchange that he raise Fuyumi as a normal human on his own. As Heads demands Staz's motive for resurrecting Fuyumi, the latter sincerely claims that he won't know his true feelings for her until she is resurrected. This prompts Heads to sever Neyn's eavesdrop on their interaction and tricks Staz into making a false pledge that would kill him should he go against Fuyumi's choices. Afterwards, Staz wakes up near the Hydra Territory's entrance along with Fuyumi as Heads tries to convince Neyn of his intention to allow Fuyumi to make her own choices. Meanwhile as Goyle traps Braz in his Cool Decision spell, he is rescued by Liz's arrival and they both escape using her teleportation magic. Unable to agree with Heads' gamble on Staz, Neyn starts debating with his motives in that they should protect her but he rebuffs that Yanagi is her true father. Meanwhile, back in the Eastern District, Deku, Yoshida and Mamejir\u014d valiantly repel their would-be conquerors, while Wolf receives a letter from Acropolis. Elsewhere, Staz laments the fact that his promise to resurrect Fuyumi had done more harm to her than good, but again promises to resurrect her in addition to leaving the Hydra Territory should they both be her desire, which she accepts. As Neyn and Heads watch Fuyumi and Staz's decision, Heads ponders that Staz will have to become a true hero to face the trials that lie ahead. Meanwhile, a mysterious group of individuals fly to an unknown location aboard a blimp. In the epilogue, Braz arrives in the covert lab where Franken had been working on a new body for Akim which turns out to be his father whom he welcomes back to life.",

Dalziel initially suspects Stevie Earle, a man who suffered severe acid burns during an accident at the factory four years ago, for which he never received any compensation.

Arnie says he was at the wheel at the time of the man's death, but neither Pascoe nor the chief constable are 100% convinced, and the testimony of a waitress at the due seems to add to their suspicions. Meanwhile, Pascoe investigates the murder of a former soldier, who is found dead in the bath, with a number of his personal possessions missing. Pascoe initially suspects that his grandson, a fellow soldier, is responsible after his grandfather offered him \u00a3500 to buy an engagement ring, thus making the boy aware that his grandfather had a substantial sum of money stashed away. However, the spotlight soon manages to find itself on one of the boy's soldier comrades.",

        "When body parts and medical waste are found in Wetherton lake, Dalziel and DC Lateef investigate the disappearance of missing nurse Leanne Proctor, last seen three days ago by her flat mates. Meanwhile, Pascoe is seriously injured whilst pursuing a suspect through an underground maze of tunnels, leaving Dalziel wondering if he will make it through. As the prime suspect for Leanne's murder looks certain to have attacked another nurse, Dalziel wastes no time in setting up a sting by trying to catch him in the act - using staff nurse, and Pascoe's latest conquest, Shannon, as bait. Convinced they have their prime suspect by the balls, Dalziel and Lateef are distraught to discover CCTV footage which places him in Oldham at the time of the killing. And when Shannon discovers that a withdrawn drug is still being prescribed to some epileptic patients, the real culprit of murder is revealed.",

The case holds many memories for Dalziel, as Simon \"Tiger\" Harper, the lover of the zoo's owner, Guy Latimer, disappeared more than twenty-five years previously after being accused of murdering another local man at a dinner party. As old grievances again rear their ugly head, the death of head vet Maria Chan also reveals a sinister business of illegal organ transplants taking place at night, using innocent Chinese immigrants as donors in return for papers which grant them access to stay in the United Kingdom. Meanwhile, Pascoe is forced to come to terms with what he wants from life when ex-wife Ellie and daughter Rosie unexpectedly arrive.",

While Dalziel sets his eyes firmly on the forensic pathologist investigating the case, Pascoe decides to do a little digging, and uncovers an entangled web involving a crooked councillor, bent surveyor and a highly dangerous team of workmen, who after a spat in the local pub, go crazy and decide to completely destroy the dig site, setting fire to archaelogical equipment, attacking the volunteers and using a JCB to crush their vehicle into a pulp. But surveying the carnage the next morning, the body of one of the workmen, Tarzan, is found in his caravan bludgeoned to death.

At the time, a seven-year-old girl was murdered, and initially, a serial killer who confessed to killing five other girls was suspected. However, she was good friends with Farr, and due to the fact they both went missing on the same day, certain townsfolk believed he was somehow responsible. His son, Colin, fails to cope with the discovery well, and leans on his college lecturer for guidance - who happens to be none other than Ellie. Torn between staying loyal to her husband and supporting her student, Ellie helps Colin to a runner when a second body is found down the mines - this time that of mining boss Heppelthwaite. Discovering the motive for Billy's killing, Pascoe races to catch the suspect - but Colin manages to find him first.",

But before his identity can be verified, he turns up dead, having been shot at the wheel of his car, parked in the police station car park. Dalziel and Pascoe must work out the identity of the killer and who is the rightful benificiary of the money. Meanwhile, Wield's private life nearly hits the front pages when a friend of his ex-partner threatens to blow the whistle on his sexuality, if he doesn't help him find his father who disappeared many years ago. And the chief constable is not best pleased when the news gets back to him, and asks Dalziel to expose his friend."

Meanwhile, Wieldy is beaten up by a group of local thugs after following one of Dalziel's prime suspects down to the riverside, and it is discovered that the woman found dead in the flat is not who her husband claims she is. And before he knows it, he is implicated in a further string of murders when a number of bodies are found beneath the police station car park, which his firm have recently been renovating.

Investigating, Dalziel and Pascoe discover someone planted gunpowder in a hedge shortly before her death, causing her horse to be startled and throw her off. As the local SABS group come under investigation, Dalziel discovers that the daughter of the huntsmaster is in fact a saboteur, and may hold more of a drudge than her compadres. But when someone murders huntsman Robert Dillinger by feeding him to the hounds, and then tries to blow up huntsmaster James Marsham, Dalziel depict's that whoever the murderer is, he has a grudge against the hunt itself rather than the individual.

        "Martin Wilkie, a soldier with the local army regiment, is found dead in a pig shed on the wedding day of one of his closest colleagues.

Things look pretty straight forward, until the nurse who found the body supposedly commits suicide. Deciding it is time to return to work, Dalziel books himself a week at the spa in an attempt to find out the real goings on. And when another grisly murder occurs, he realises that certain people claim to be somebody they aren't \u2013 and the truth begins to unravel in more than one horrific way for Pascoe, as his latest floozy turns out to the prime suspect. And when all of the events are connected to the death of a man at the spa two years ago, Dalziel is forced to step in and take charge of the situation. Is Pascoe naive enough to let the prime suspect get away just to have a little bit of fun, or will his head rule his heart?",

        "Dalziel is forced to accept new recruit Sgt. Peter Pascoe as the pair team up for the very first time to investigate a serious murder case. Wetherton Rugby Club's golden boy, Sam Connon, wakes up after arriving at home with a hangover, to find his wife, Mary, dead in the armchair. Being vice president of the rugby club himself, Dalziel decides to ruffle a few feathers and find out who had enough of a motive to want to kill her. However, with the murder weapon nowhere to be found, evidence of the killer's involvement is rather thin on the ground. The discovery of hidden 'dirty' letters, discussion of naked foreplay at the bedroom window and the unearthing of the murder weapon during the search for a missing eight year old boy make for the final pieces of the puzzle. Does someone at the rugby club bear a terrible grudge against the couple \u2013 or is the true murderer closer to home?",

Speaking to all of the staff who worked with Girling prior to her death, Dalziel struggles to make any headway until the body of Anita Sewell, a student accusing another staff member of sexual harassment, is found naked on a nearby golf course.
