        "After formally introducing himself and revealing Warstar's existence, Dereputa leaves, much to Alata's dismay. After Alata reveals that he has fought Dereputa, the Gosei Angels reflect on the legend of the Gosei Machines. Walking Nozomu home, Alata meets the boy's father Professor Shuichirou Amachi. As Eri and Hyde arrive to the site of Heaven's Tower, the Master Head attempts to contact them with a means to return to the Gosei World. Elsewhere, the Landick siblings battle the Universal Insect Monster Zaruwaku of the UFO and the Bibi Soldiers after they discover that Nozomu and several other people have been abducted. Contacting the other Gosei Angels, the Skick Goseigers arrive to aid them while Hyde manages to receive the Master Head's message. A solar flare that occurs once every 200 years will allow them to return to the Gosei World without the Heaven's Tower. Hyde arrives at the battle, finding the Landick siblings fighting with each other instead of fighting Warstar with the Goseigers of the Skick Tribe. He notifies the other Goseigers of the Master Head's message and then transforms to fight Zaruwaku. After Gosei Blue weakens Zaruwaku, he contacts the Master Head to say that they are staying on Earth. The Goseigers use the Gosei Buster to destroy Zaruwaku, freeing everyone. However, Buredoran of the Comet sends his Bibi Bugs to revive and enlarge Zaruwaku. The Goseigers' refusal to run away enables them to summon the Gosei Machines and battle Zaruwaku's UFO clones before forming Gosei Great to finish the monster off. After the fight, Hyde uses the Memorywash Card to erase the memories of everyone that was abducted to make sure that their mission remains secret. The Master Head watches on from the Gosei World, ruminating that things will not be easy for the Goseigers.",

However, in the middle of training, the siblings get into an argument over Moune's fighting skills before sensing the attack from Yuzeikusu of the Ice & Snow. Gosei Yellow battles the Universal Insect Monster on her own before Gosei Black intervenes as the Skick Gosei Angels and Hyde arrive to fight the Bibi Soldiers. But after Gosei Yellow gets hurt when her Rockrush Card is deflected back at her, Gosei Black forces Yuzeikusu to fall back as the male Goseigers pursue before the Bibi Soldiers interfere. Later, Agri and Moune get into another argument over her using an imperfect Tensou Skill. In retrospect to what Nozomu's father said to him earlier, Alata suggests to the others that they move in with them at the Amachi Astronomical Institute. The Landick Goseigers refuse before Moune runs off to fight Yuzeikusu make herself look better to her brother. By the time she finds Yuzeikusu, she fights him in a battle she cannot win. Elsewhere, Agri looks for Moune as Alata offers his aid and helps him realize the importance of friends as they find Gosei Yellow. After Gosei Black convinces her to let them help, the Goseigers battle Yuzeikusu together by clipping the Universal Insect Monster's wings. Gosei Yellow wounds him before the team forms the Gosei Buster to finish the fight. The Bibi Bugs enlarge Yuzeikusu, and the Goseigers form Gosei Great to fight the Universal Insect Monster with the Snake and Tiger Headders before finishing him.

Later, as the others train to master Alata's ability so they can counter Hidou's speed, they learn from Nozomu that Alata is attempting pull-ups despite his injuries before Datas contacts them concerning Warstar activity. While the others fight Hidou, Gosei Red battles Dereputa and manages a pull-up to catch the villain off guard and defeat him before Dereputa escapes. Returning to the others after they use the Seaick Headders to defeat Hidou, Gosei Great is formed to fight the enlarged Universal Insect Monster. But overwhelmed by his speed, and Gosei Red unable to fight any further, the Landick siblings take control to chase down Hidou. Refusing to give up, the Landick siblings gain the Landick Brothers who combine unto to Gosei Great to form Landick Gosei Great who catches up to Hidou and defeats him. Later, vowing to train harder to defeat Dereputa as he finds Nozomu attempting pull-ups, Alata and the Gosei Angels cheer him on from afar."

        "After shopping, Eri and Agri help an old man named Jotaro who is kind to the former and mean to the latter to the point of challenging him to a sumo match with Eri on the line. Beating Agri easily, Jotaro takes Eri away as the others decide to sit this out and have Agri get Eri out of the predicament. To get her back, Agri finds himself doing manual labor and gardening for Jotaro. While taking a break, Agri and Eri learn of an attack by Warstar's Zuteramedorop Alien Abauta of Research. While fighting the Goseigers, Abauta purposely allows himself to be attacked before taking his leave with the fighting data he receives. Forced to return with Eri to his dismay, Agri resumes working the garden in full force while Eri notices a photo of Jotaro with his wife Sachiko. The next day, after Eri talks to Agri about Sachiko possibly being the man's deceased wife, Agri learns that the area of land he was not allowed to work on is a cabbage garden that was planted by Jotaro and Sachiko that Jotaro vowed to protect. By then, Abauta arrives to destroy all oxygen-producing plant life as Goseigers arrive to stop him. However, using the data he amassed from their previous fight, Abauta systematically defeats the Goseigers before flying towards the man's cabbage garden. Refusing to let Abauta destroy the cabbages, Gosei Black fights him with the new techniques he learned from the gardening. Once enlarged by the Bibi Bugs, after attempting to destroy the Snake Header until the Landick Brothers arrive to its aid, Abauta battles Landick Gosei Great before being destroyed. Later, after enjoying the vegetables Agri worked so hard on, the Goseigers are shocked to see Sachiko, explaining that she has just returned from a vacation, and Jotaro reveals that he has a thing for cute girls. This in turn causes a distraught Eri and Agri to beg Hyde to use his Memorywash Card on them.",

        "As Nozomu leaves for a friend's birthday party, Hyde leaves to pay his respects to a fallen Seaick Gosei Angel until he sees the last person he ever expected to see: Luview Alien Kurasuniigo of the 5000\u00b0C. Losing his cool at the sight of the monster, Gosei Blue battles Kurasuniigo and loses to the stronger opponent as the other Goseigers arrive. Gosei Blue tells them not to interfere with this fight, surprising the others. When Kurasuniigo takes his leave, the others demand an explanation for Hyde's sudden change of behavior as the Master Head appears on Datas's screen and asks Hyde if he has forgotten his mission as a Gosei Angel. Hyde leaves as the Master Head reveals that Hyde had a partner as a Seaick Gosei Angel whom he fought alongside with named Magis until they both fought Kurasuniigo. In that fight, Magis as Gosei Green sacrificed himself to save Hyde, and Hyde blames himself for his best friend's death at the hands of Kurasuniigo. The next day, Hyde uses Datas to find clues about Kurasuniigo, until he overloads Datas's processors. By then, Professor Amachi arrives with a friend of his, Professor Sakana-kun, who is as much of a fish fanatic as Amachi is into the stars. The others have Hyde help out the young professor, seeing the man's aquarium which reminds him of his duty as a Gosei Angel. Elsewhere, the other Goseigers fight Kurasuniigo as he is evaporating the sea with his heat powers. The four lose until Hyde arrives with the intent to protect the sea rather than take revenge. Gosei Blue manages to defeat Kurasuniigo before the Gosei Buster is formed to take the monster out. Gosei Great is then formed to fight the enlarged Kurasuniigo, overcoming his heat attack with the Seaick Brothers before becoming Seaick Gosei Great to destroy Kurasuniigo. Later, Hyde returns to pay his final respects to Magis and ask him to wish him luck in fulfilling his mission before the others arrive to cheer him up."

With the others curious about where Moune's been going for days, they find her at a General Hospital in a cheerleader outfit as she and other girls are cheering up a hospitalized girl named Miku who is about to be operated on. After Moune reveals that she secretly used her Sparkquake Gosei Card to make an encouraging message for Miku, the Gosei Angels then respond to Yokubabanger's attack as he absorbs electric energy and uses it to blow things up. Though Goseigers get the upper hand while he was low on energy, Yokubabanger wounds are healed as he starts absorbing all electric energy in the city district to easily defeat the Goseigers. After learning of the more harmful indirect damage caused by the Universal Insect Monster, finding the emergency power in Miku's operating room out, Gosei Yellow leads the second attack. By then, Monsu Doreiku reveals himself as he heals Yokubabanger again to defeat the Goseigers. Unable to stand by anymore, Datas runs towards the hospital with a plan to save Miku while telling Gosei Yellow to use the Sparkquake and dance up enough electricity for Datas to amplify.

At the Amachi Astronomical Institute, Alata gets chewed up by Eri for getting his Gosei Cards mixed in with some playing cards until Datas alerts the Gosei Angels to Powereddark's assault. However, Powereddark uses the Power Seeds Buredoran gave him to counter all of the Goseigers' attack until Alata uses the Comprethunder Card which the monster has no counter for, before he retreats when the others learn that Gosei Pink cannot use the attack. Deciding to train herself to perform the execution of Comprethunder, Eri takes Alata to the mountainside in order to help her master it as the others watch from a distance. But instead of training her, Alata treats to a strawberry parfait before taking her to see a good view of Shinjuku's skyline.

As Gosei Blue and Pink fight Giemurou with the Landick siblings arriving for support, Gosei Knight is horrified to learn of Buredoran's scheme as Gosei Red battles him. As the two fights collide, Gosei Knight grieves about being used to kill the planet until the Landick siblings snap him of it before they attempt to free him to his shock. Seeing the Goseigers' determination to save the world, Gosei Knight breaks free from his cage and battles Buredoran and Giemurou, defeating the latter as Buredoran summons the Bibi Bugs to enlarge Giemurou. Stopping the Goseigers from summoning their Headders, Gosei Knight summons the Knight Brothers into battle as he becomes Groundion, combining with them to become Gosei Ground and destroy Giemurou.

        "As the Gosei Angels talk about the turn of events with Gosei Knight with the intent to grant his trust much to Agri's dismay, Buredoran finds Giemurou of the Kappa to use in his own plan for Gosei Knight. After using his ticks to capture several people, Giemurou battles the Goseigers before Gosei Knight arrive. Overpowering the Yuumajuu at first, nearly getting some people caught in the crossfire as Gosei Black is unable to save a little girl named Kanako from a tick, Gosei Knight is captured with Buredoran's aid. Later, as they try to make amends with Kanako's father, the Gosei Angels reveal their identities while promising to save the girl before others leave to find her as Moune consoles her brother.

        "Sensing it earlier, Buredoran unearths the site of the Abare Headder. However, he cannot reach the Abare Headder due to a barrier and sends the giant Semattarei of the Brocken Spectre to force the Goseigers into the open so they can retrieve it for him. When the Goseigers find Semattarei and form Gosei Great to fight him, they are caught off guard by the Yuumajuu as he resurrects several other members of the Yuumajuu that the Goseigers destroyed. The revived monsters overpower Gosei Great before a giant Gosei Knight intervenes, revealing that the Goseigers' opponents are nothing but illusions. The Goseigers exit Gosei Great to find Gosei Knight fighting Semattarei, as Gosei Knight reveals that the Yuumajuu are after the Abare Headder and tells the Goseigers to go find it first. As they arrive to the site of the Abare Headder, they find Buredoran and seemingly drive him off after an attack. The Goseigers are able to get through the barrier to the Abare Headder when Buredoran returns and steals it away, revealing that he had used them to break through the barrier. The Master Head explains that the Abare Headder has vast dangerous powers that makes Alata curious, but Datas interrupts the message to tell the Gosei Angels that Buredoran and Semattarei have returned and are attacking. As the Goseigers and Gosei Knight arrive to fight, Buredoran uses the Abare Headder to power up Semattarei and make his illusions real. As the revived Yuumajuu overpower the Goseigers, Gosei Red realizes that the Abare Headder is fighting against Buredoran. Gosei Red grabs the Abare Headder and senses that it is only angry and dangerous because it fears its own power. Gosei Red offers his friendship to the Abare Headder which causes it to transform into the Miracle Dragon Headder. It summons its companions and the five Miracle Gosei Headders conjure up the Gosei Tenswords for each of the Goseigers, transforming them into the Super Goseigers. With their new powers, the Goseigers force Buredoran to retreat and destroy Semattarei and his mirage Yuumajuu. The Gosei Angels thank the Miracle Gosei Headders for their help as the Headders become Miracle Gosei Power Cards to summon them later. Elsewhere, Buredoran is confronted by Makuin and Kinggon who express their disappointment in his actions and failure.",

        "After calming down an enraged Makuin about Kinggon's recent actions, Buredoran's plan to gain Makuin's favor is halted due to Makuin's pride as he willing welcomes the aide of Pikarime of the Shak\u014dkidog\u016b. Pikarime proceeds to put the city's residents under her mind-control spell, with Nozomu among them. When he arrives to the Amachi Astronomical Institute, Nozomu is unresponsive to everyone for accidentally destroying his father's wine glass, causing Professor Amachi to fall into a deep depression that he failed his son as a father to keep him from becoming a bad seed. Alata tries to comfort Professor Amachi by assuring him that Nozomu is a good kid because of him raising while the other Gosei Angels head to fight Pikarime. They find her in battle with Gosei Knight before she has her victims cover her escape. Though Alata gives Professor Amachi the strength to reach through to his son as a parent, Nozomu is nowhere to be found, as the boy has been ordered by Pikarime to lead the rest of her victims to their deaths by jumping off of a cliff. As Professor Amachi attempts to reach through to his son, the Goseigers find Pikarime as Gosei Knight fights her and Makuin. Though Pikarime gets the upper hand in the fight, the tables are turned when Nozomu is freed from Pikarime's control by his father's love for him. The Super Goseigers use their Miracle Gosei Dynamic on Pikarime and Makuin, defeating the former while the latter is saved from the attack by Buredoran. After being enlarged by Buredoran, Pikarime is destroyed by Ground Gosei Great using the Taka Headder's power with her spell completely brolen. Soon after, as the Gosei Angels welcome Nozomu and his father home, Buredoran succeeds in becoming Makuin's right hand man as he reveals that he has a plan for the Goseigers and needs the Erurei Box for it to work."

Meanwhile, Nozomu is excited to hear that his mother Yuko is coming back from her extensive work, and later meets Gosei Knight as Hyde arrives with the information he requested so he can learn more about humans. As Nozomu and Professor Amachi get ready, Metal-A causes a mass panic in the subway system, causing Yuko's train to go out of service. Nozomu goes with his father to the station to find out more about the delay, he is relieved that train is still going to arrive. The Goseigers go to battle Metal-A just as Gosei Knight takes over. However, Metal-A teleports away after destroying the station terminal. With Datas analyzing all of the mass transportation sites that Metal-A can target, Gosei Knight checks the train station as Nozomu sees him and overhears that Metal-A has placed a bomb on Kamaya Bridge: the bridge the train will have to cross. Gosei Knight assures Nozomu that they will save his mother before he heads to the bridge to battle Metal-A on his own, with the Super Goseigers joining the fray later. Damaged by Gosei Knight's sword, Metal-A detonates the bomb. Refusing to give up, the Goseigers receive the Gosei Wonder card as they summon Gosei Wonder's Headders to form a makeshift bridge for the train. Enraged, Metal-A uses the Bibi Nails on herself as Gosei Ground and Wonder Gosei Great are formed to battle her. She is eventually destroyed by Wonder Gosei Great's Wonderful Strike. Later, as Gosei Knight watches from afar, Nozomu and the others discover that Yuko never made it to her train, and was never in danger. Elsewhere, Metal-A has been rebuilt by Robogorg, whose favor she lost as he has installed a bomb in her to serve as punishment should she ever fail him, again.",

The Gosei Angels tell their own childhood dreams before they realize that Alata is nowhere to be found. Eri finds Alata using one of his Tensou Techniques to help a couple become closer, but before she and Nozomu can say anything to him, they are interrupted by Datas reporting that the Bibi Soldiers are attacking near by. Gosei Red and Gosei Pink blast the Bibi Soldiers, only for the grunts' defeat to be negated by a Matroid. Cornering him with the others and Gosei Knight, the Matroid introduces himself Bakutofuji-ER of the Timer and uses his ability to turn back time 10 seconds against them. Though the Goseigers get an advantage with Gosei Knight holding the Matroid so they can use the Gosei Buster on him, Metal-A interferes as she reveals the attack to actually be a debut for their newest member: Buredoran. Rebuilt by Robogorg and renamed Bred-RUN of the Cyborg, the Goseigers are shocked to hear that their old foe's memory has been wiped clean, save for his name and his hatred for them. Super Gosei Red battles Bred-RUN as the other Super Goseigers and Gosei Knight join in, managing to injure Bred-RUN until Bakutofuji-ER enlarges to cover Metal-A and Bred-RUN from further damage. Gosei Ultimate is summoned and Gosei Ground is formed to battle Bakutofuji-ER. When Gosei Ultimate's Ultimate Strike attack collides with the Matroid's Time Reverse, Bred-RUN secretly fires at the two conflicting energies, causing a time rip that inadvertently sends Alata back in time to before Warstar invaded Earth and destroyed Heaven's Tower. After saving the Nozomu of that time, before realizing his situation, Alata decides to use this opportunity to prevent Heaven's Tower's destruction by summoning the Gosei Angels of that time. Back in the present, the Matrintis Empire members now have an advantage against Gosei Knight and the other four Goseigers. However, Bred-RUN suddenly malfunctions and Metal-A spirits him away to fine-tune him, much to Robogorg's dismay. Robogorg subjects her to his Punishment Bomb, while a seemingly inactive Bred-RUN watches.",

Arriving to find Metal-A and Bibi Soldiers, the Goseigers and Gosei Knight fight he before she calls out Ain-I of the Neutral to attack the Goseigers, but he instead does nothing as she uses him to take an attack from the Gosei Buster meant for her before falling back. When Ain-I comes to his senses, Gosei Pink realizes something's different about him as she befriends the Matroid to everyone's shock as Alata asks for Eri to look after him. In the process, feeling obligated for the Matroid losing his memory, Eri renames Ain-I \"Koro\" as she teaches him many things such as friendship.

As they research, Hyde calls Datas a machine, which Moune takes offense to, before Datas detects a Matrintis attack. After stopping the Bibi Soldiers, the Goseigers and Gosei Knight are stopped in their tracks when Metal-A and Bred-RUN present a missile directed towards the International Conference Center. The two villains offer to give the Goseigers the missile if they get Datas, who accepts the demands to the Goseigers' dismay as he reminds them that he is just a machine. However, Bred-RUN activates the missile as he and Metal-A take their leave while the Goseigers barely manage to destroy the missile. Later, the Gosei Angels take the loss of their friend hard as an upset Hyde attempts to track Datas via his energy signature. The next day, as Hyde goes to the cape after finding a signal, Alata and the other Gosei Angels arrive to the scene of a disturbance caused by Saroge-DT of Imitation who reveals himself to be based on Datas in form and data, revealing Datas is to be thrown into the sea by Metal-A. Using the data extracted from Datas, Saroge-DT manages to overwhelm the Goseigers and Gosei Knight until Super Gosei Blue arrives with the real Datas, having survived Metal-A's attack that knocked him into the water.

After Datas manages to get some hits in disguised as a second Super Gosei Blue, Saroge-DT is blasted to bits by the Super Gosei Knight Dynamic. However, Metal-A recreates Saroge-DT as a giant with Datas enlarging into Datas Hyper to fight with Gosei Ground's support before Gosei Ultimate joins Datas in a Datas Dynamic Crush/Ultimate Strike combo that destroys the Matroid while an astonished Metal-A leaves.

However, somehow regaining his strength, Gosei Knight arrives and forms Gosei Ground as he and other Tensou Giants execute their signature moves to stop Robogorg. With Robogorg's attack canceled, the Goseigers form Ultimate Gosei Great to destroy him. But the Gosei Angels' victory is premature as Robogorg's head is revealed to be still active and he attempts to rebuild himself with Bred-RUN's help in activating his Salvation Cell component. However, Bred-RUN crushes the item and reveals that he has regained his memory prior to the battle with Metal-A's help. Furthermore, revealing he intentionally failed to seal the Leon Cellular, Bred-RUN only kept up the charade so the Goseigers can damage Robogorg to the point where he can not fight back. With Robogorg realizing who he truly is, Bred-RUN throws the head into the air and blasts it to bits with his missiles. After looking to a partially active Metal-A and destroying her mercilessly, Bred-RUN takes his leave while telling the Goseigers that they will meet again."

After covering his Bred-RUN of the Cyborg incarnation and the Matrintis Empire, along with both his ability to seal Tensouders and his part in sending Alata in time, Nozomu brings up the Yuumajuu as the Goseigers remember the Buredoran of the Chupacabra incarnation. By then, Gosei Knight arrives to bring up Buredoran's knowledge of the Abare Headder and his strange ability to control it which a Yuumajuu could never achieve. When the Gosei Angels figure that he may have freed Makuin and Kinggon from their prison, they remember that Buredoran was also a member of Warstar as they recap their battles with the Buredoran of the Comet incarnation and realize Buredoran knew about the Gosei Angels along with being the only Yuumajuu to go to space. However, Alata add more worry to the group upon realizing that Buredoran may not be a Yuumajuu but something else.

As Eri stays with Datas to look after Nozomu, using her singing to heal Nozomu from the residual energy from Brajira's attack on him, the others head to the Land Wedge where the Gosei Angels realize that Brajira needs their Gosei Power before he arrives with Dark Gosei Knight. Having no choice, the four Goseigers transform until Alata stops them upon realizing that Brajira intends to sacrifice Dark Gosei Knight to complete the final wedge. As a result, the four Goseigers find that they are unable to defeat Dark Gosei Knight with brute force as they try to snap him out of his brainwashing before Gosei Red assumes his super form.

Nozomu wakes up as Professor Amachi reveals that he knew about Datas as he tells Datas to help the others.

Brajira mocks the spirits for foolishly trusting him before sending them away as Gosei Knight then appears, with Brajira destroying Labyrindel to rid himself of the Headder. At the Amachi Astronomical Institute, Nozomu goes to ask Alata if he is afraid of what is going to happen next, but Alata assures him that only he and humanity can choose the future before Eri calls them back up stairs to think up a plan. However, upon realizing he is nowhere to be found, the Gosei Angels find Gosei Knight washed up on the shore as he reveals that Brajira is about to execute the Nega End, which is confirmed by the Master Head and Professor Amachi to be in one hour during a solar eclipse. The Gosei Angels find Brajira as he sends out countless waves of Bibi Soldiers to hold them back. They reach him and assume their Super Goseiger forms to fight him directly. Elsewhere, the Master Head possesses Gosei Ultimate so he, Gosei Ground, and Datas Hyper can take out the Wedges. However, Brajira overpowers the Super Goseigers and reverts them to their normal forms. Declaring them to be devils for standing against him, Brajira mortally wounds each of the Gosei Angels while negating their transformations as the solar eclipse begins. Refusing to give up, Alata is shocked when the others offer to give him their Gosei Power so he can fight Brajira on equal terms. Though the four are intent to sacrifice themselves if it meant saving the world, Alata refuses to accept their power, saying he would rather they work together. The four Gosei Angels rejoin Alata as the final battle reaches its climax.",

        "After turning down the others' attempt to sacrifice themselves to give him the power to stop Brajira, Alata reinvigorates the Gosei Angels' hopes as they resume their Goseiger forms and continue the fight as the eclipse is at its peak. Though the Goseigers use the Gosei Buster to knock down Brajira with their Gosei Blasters boosting it, he refuses to let them ruin his plans as he uses a Bibi Bug to enlarge himself, with the Goseigers forming Gosei Great to fight him. Although they are overpowered, the Goseigers summon the Brother Headders to form Sky-Land-Sea Gosei Great to hold Brajira off until the eclipse passes with a nearly suicidal Sky-Land-Sea Strike. However, though he is reduced back to normal size, Brajira prepares to begin the Nega End before Gosei Red executes the Red Dynamic to kill him. Though the eclipse ends, it is revealed that Brajira actually needs to sacrifice himself to begin the process, as his body dissolves into Dark Gosei Power and enters the Wedges. With Datas Hyper, Gosei Ground, and Gosei Ultimate unable to stop the Wedges, Alata becomes focused on the reason behind Brajira's madness before the Master Head tells them that they have ten minutes to stop the Nega End. As Nozomu protects an apple tree Alata planted, Alata arrives to the Sky Wedge while Hyde and Eri head to the Sea Wedge and the Landick siblings to the Land Wedge to attempt to stop them with their Tensou Techniques, but are not successful. Then, Alata realizes that they have Gosei Power because they are immature and desire to see everything the planet has to offer. The Gosei Angels unleash their full Gosei Power to regroup and use the Gosei Global technique to negate the Nega End while restoring the Heaven's Tower in the process. Later, as full-fledged Gosei Angels, the Master Head tells them that they can now return to the Gosei World. However, Alata asks if he and the others can stay on Earth to see more of the planet has to offer while living out their dreams. The Master Head accepts their request, with Nozomu elated before he realizes that they are leaving the Institute. After assuring a heartbroken Nozomu that they will be friends forever, Alata and others say their good-byes to him and his father. As Gosei Knight leaves to enter a deep sleep to restore his Gosei Power, the Gosei Angels part ways to watch over everyone while Nozomu thanks them for everything they have done for him.",

It contains a restless caldera that is actively deforming and it is therefore likely that Deception Island will witness further eruptions in the future. The Area has an exceptionally important flora, including at least 18 species which have not been recorded elsewhere in the Antarctic. Of particular importance are the very small, unique biological communities associated with the island\u2019s geothermal area. The island also has eight species of breeding seabirds including the world's largest colony of chinstrap penguins.

Perona then notices somehing interesting, and after Zoro gets lost and finds his way to her, notices a large tomb, and shadowy beast-like figures with weapons attack Zoro. Meanwhile, Brook learns that the residents are giving what little food they have as tribute to him in order to gain protection from the Longarm Tribe. When the Longarm Tribe kidnaps a female worshiper, the cult asks him for help, and he agrees to help her before rejoining the rest of the crew. The story returns to the present as Luffy's ship is behind schedule en route to Marineford as Ace's execution nears."

Some soldiers break in to find Robin, smashing Soran's pictures in an attempt to determine her location, and Robin is captured. She learns that she is on an island full of prisoners and citizens of countries that refused to join the World Government, and that she and the others are being forced to build a bridge. Meanwhile, Usopp finds himself on Bowin Island, an island full of man-eating plants, with a man named Heracles.",
