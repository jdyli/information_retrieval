        "Akiha's peaceful breakfast is interrupted when her sister Kazane tries to get Akiha to agree to an arranged marriage. With her younger sister Nami also making derisive remarks, Akiha and her robot servant and friend Imoko flee the house for the spaceport and school. Nami subsequently gives chase only to be stopped in her tracks by both her agoraphobia and lack of a student card. Akiha and Imoko are joined by two of Akiha's classmates who borrow an escape pod for Akiha so she has no need to return home. The escape pod encounters a gravity quake caused by the brain colony Leopard which Akiha and Imoko explore before meeting the eccentric AI face-to-face. Together with ICP officer Itsuki Kannagi who tries to arrest both Akiha and Leopard, they use their QT-Arms to prevent Leopard from crashing into Earth. At the end of the episode, Honoka Kawai shows up on Leopard and calls Akiha \"The Girl Who Leapt Through Space\".",

        "After the commotion over the appearance of Leopard, Itsuki Kannagi is recalled by her superior while Akiha's classmate Julio rescues Akiha from floating in space. Back at home, Kazane apologizes to Akiha for trying to force her into marriage too soon. Honoka Kawai, the mysterious girl who was on Leopard, shows up as a student in Akiha's class and abducts Akiha after school. After using a machine to create their Q-TECTORs, Honoka and Akiha set off to an abandoned space factory in search of the Golden Orb to repair Leopard's antimatter cannons. Unfortunately, the two girls play right into the hands of Itsuki Kannagi and her partner Ul who have prepared an ambush. Itsuki defeats Honoka and surprises Akiha as she is preparing to take the parts Leopard needs, but the arrival of a huge robot that Honoka recognizes as a Nervalist automaton quickly endangers everyone.",

The girls infiltrate the set and rig the boat with real weapons, but they are caught by Kawasaki, who contracts them into his film. After being forced into Playboy-like costumes, Aoi and Manami steal the boat and break into the yacht to find that Kio and Eris have switched clothes, enabling Kio to use the power suit's strength-enhancing capabilities.

Aoi sabotages the ship's engines, but is caught by an agent of Dogsia, who is destroying the ship in the hopes that it will take Eris with it.

As Kio runs to catch the plane, Aoi regains consciousness and, thinking it is a dream, confesses to Kio.",
