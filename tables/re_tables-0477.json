        "It turns out that S was meeting with Takashi to give him the blueprints of the Tokyo Tower renovation plans. Rin nearly beats Tamura to death for interfering. Due to his ESP and his strong connection to Tamura, Haruhiko is able to sense this and teleports to Tamura's rescue in time to catch a glimpse of Rin as he flies away. A few days later, Alice goes to another meeting with the reincarnates and is forced to take Rin with her, whereby, to the surprise of everyone, he announces that he is the reincarnation of Shukaido. To explain the age difference, he mentions that his first reincarnation died in a car accident. After the meeting, Alice feels guilty that she triggered Rin's moon dreams, which largely seem to be nightmares, so she decides to quit meeting with the other reincarnates and join the choir. After seeing him in the hospital ward visiting Tamura, Rin decides to have a chat with Haruhiko about what Haruhiko's previous incarnation, Shukaido, did to Rin's true reincarnation, Shion, on the moon base. Here, Rin explains to Haruhiko his plan to gather the moon base passwords and \"save the Earth\". A few days later, Tamura, now out of the hospital, receives a call from Haruhiko's worried mother, asking him to come by to visit her son. When Tamura walks into Haruhiko's room, he is witness to Haruhiko's projected moon dream. Haruhiko, terrified, teleports out of the room and to the river in order to drown himself. Issei and Sakura happen to be walking by at the same time, discussing Issei's struggle with Enju's feelings toward Gyokuran, and witness this. Just after Haruhiko jumps, Issei scrambles and dives in after him.",

Rin sees Tamura off at the train the next day, while Haruhiko sits down to write Tamura a letter detailing the complete story of Shukaido, Shion, and the moon base scientists. Later, Haruhiko shows up for the meeting with the other reincarnations and has to improvise his story due to the unforeseen issue of Issei and Sakura having been there when he tried to kill himself.

At the same time, Issei and Sakura decide to go visit Tamura and ask about Haruhiko's suicide attempt.

Before Rin shows up, Jinpachi tells everyone at the next meeting about Alice and Rin's engagement and also about Alice and Haruhiko's secret meeting. Rin appears and, having overheard, tells the others he ended the engagement because Haruhiko told him to. With all this information, the others really start to distrust Haruhiko and discuss the passwords. Daisuke then steps in and tells everyone to remain silent about their passwords, explaining that together they could activate some dangerous functionality on the moon base. Meanwhile, in Kyoto, Tamura receives a call from Hokuto saying that his mother wants to meet with him. He goes to meet her and she explains she is very protective of Mikuro due to how his ESP powers negatively affected his childhood. However, Haruhiko's letter, which she had read, made it clear she needed to discuss things with Tamura. She explains to him that he must not only strive to help Haruhiko, but that he needs to save Rin as well. Later, at the reincarnates meeting, they decide to draw up a timeline and by doing so, they start recalling details, such as Mokuren's singing causing the plants to grow, and the video they took of her singing on Thanksgiving one year. On the way home, Sakura recalls a sad moment from Shusuran's perspective about her and Enju. Alice later agrees to attend the next reincarnates meeting. Finally, while Haruhiko is at the aquarium, Mikuro appears and slips him a message telling him that teleportation hurts his heart, and then disappears before he can react.",

With all this information, the others really start to distrust Haruhiko and discuss the passwords. Daisuke then steps in and tells everyone to remain silent about their passwords, explaining that together they could activate some dangerous functionality on the moon base. Meanwhile, in Kyoto, Tamura receives a call from Hokuto saying that his mother wants to meet with him. He goes to meet her and she explains she is very protective of Mikuro due to how his ESP powers negatively affected his childhood. However, Haruhiko's letter, which she had read, made it clear she needed to discuss things with Tamura. She explains to him that he must not only strive to help Haruhiko, but that he needs to save Rin as well. Later, at the reincarnates meeting, they decide to draw up a timeline and by doing so, they start recalling details, such as Mokuren's singing causing the plants to grow, and the video they took of her singing on Thanksgiving one year. On the way home, Sakura recalls a sad moment from Shusuran's perspective about her and Enju. Alice later agrees to attend the next reincarnates meeting. Finally, while Haruhiko is at the aquarium, Mikuro appears and slips him a message telling him that teleportation hurts his heart, and then disappears before he can react.",

        "Haruhiko believes the letter he received is from an associate of S's, and so calls up Takashi to verify he tore up his letter to Tamura. Takashi tells Haruhiko that he did tear up the letter, as Tamura secretly instructed him to tell Haruhiko. At the meeting, Alice looks at the timeline and contests that Shukaido was the last to die due to various things Rin has said about his dreams. The others have remarked previously that Haruhiko's personality does not match up well with Shion's, from the little they have seen of him, but still do not think much of it and leave the timeline the way it is. Later, Haruhiko meets with Rin and chastises him about having his associates, like \"M\", spy on him, showing Rin the letter. Rin's obvious lack of recognition instantly clues Haruhiko in that M was working for Tamura. As soon as he leaves, he frantically calls Tamura, telling him to get out of there and hide Takashi and M, and that he is heading to Kyoto. Rin, meanwhile, sets up a trap for Takashi, in order to draw M out and finish off Tamura for good. As planned, Tamura intercepts the fake \"love letter\" and goes to the meeting location in Takashi's place yet again, this time with Mikuro in tow. A battle of wits between Rin and Tamura, as well as a psychic battle between Rin and Mikuro begins.

        "The someone who appeared in-between Tamura, Mikuro and Rin was Haruhiko, having teleported three times at significant danger to himself in order to save them. After deflecting the blast, Rin blasts him again. As Rin is about to finish the rest of them off again, Mikuro simultaneously counters his attack, causing a huge explosion. Rin teleports, further damaging himself, and then wakes up in the hospital, scared to death. The doctors say he has been hit by a car even though his wounds are not consistent with such an event. Rin lapses into dreams of Shion's childhood. Shion was born on a war-torn moon called Tess. He was found by the alliance after killing a group of soldiers with his psychic powers, who then transported him to Shia, the largest of the outlying planets of the Homeworld. There he lived with the priestesses of Sarjalim, the Lim Lians, learning about the history of their race, as well as the Sarjalim faith. This is when he meets Lian Karsh, the only person he would have an ounce of respect for in his entire life. After not too long, a foster father was found for him, named La Zlo. Shion moves in with La Zlo and his pet alien cat, Kyaa. Through La Zlo's patience and understanding, Shion begins to learn what it is to have a real family, until La Zlo and Kyaa die after only 78 days of fostering. He is taken back to the Lim Lians and ends up meeting Gyokuran in grade school. Later, in high school, Gyokuran introduces Shion to Shukaido. Shion remains bitter from the day he first meets Gyokuran about Gyokuran's perfect life and how he, Shion, could never have anything like that or fit in with these perfect people.",

        "In high school, Shion and Gyokuran have a large fight over a girl named Coco, not because Shion likes her, but because Shion uses her to hurt Gyokuran. Gyokuran has now become a rival of Shion's, and he sinks to the level of using other people in order to hurt Gyokuran. They have a fight and part on bad terms. After graduation, Shion goes on to become an acclaimed engineer, one of the best. Despite this, he cannot seem to find someone who will love him for him, no matter what. Eventually, due to his bad behavior, he is forced to join the ZKK-101 team and go to a remote location to study the planet known colloquially as Earth. Because it is an undesirable job, he gets a large sum of money for it. Using that money, he buys a giant alien cat and names him Kyaa Junior. Before leaving for the ZKK-101 mission, he leaves Kyaa Junior with Liam Karsh. When he meets the rest of his team, he becomes incredibly bitter about Mokuren's perceived perfection as a Kiches Sarjalian. At the moon base, he finds that he enjoys tormenting her as often as the opportunity presents itself. He also despises the way all the other men fawn over her. After a while, he is informed via message that Lian Karsh has died and that Kyaa Junior is ill and needs medical attention. Since the Lians cannot afford the vet bill, Shion authorizes the sale of Kyaa Junior to the vet for a loss. He takes out his frustration on Mokuren, who then heads off to secretly sing to the plants, which causes the moon base to be overgrown with weeds overnight, breaking all of Shion's computers.",

        "The scientists all work on cleaning up the weeds, and Shion is furious with Mokuren for messing up his computers. Gyokuran tells Shion that he is in love with Mokuren, while Shion dismisses his comment saying it does not matter since she is Kiches and cannot get married. Fast forward, the scientists are cleaning up weeds for the umpteenth time and Shusuran is incredibly annoyed. She argues with Enju about Mokuren being in love with Gyokuran. Later, the scientists receive desperate messages from Shia saying that the war has taken a turn for the worse. Finally, the signal from Shia is completely lost, indicating total annihilation. Everyone goes into shock for a few days, then Shion decides it would be a good idea to go down to Earth to live out their lives. Mokuren initially agrees, but Gyokuran and Hiiragi disagree. Hiiragi, as team leader, puts his foot down. Shion, however, continues to harass Shusuran for her password and ends up getting thrown in the anti-psychic brig for being a dissenter. While bringing him his lunch, Shion eventually says to Mokuren: \"I love you, give up your Kiches (virginity) and I will do whatever it takes to make up with Gyokuran.\" She accepts, but when she enters Shion's cell for the deed, she changes her mind at the last minute and resists. She is later found crying by the others and Gyokuran goes insane with rage. Shion crowns himself the winner in their rivalry as he got to Mokuren first with the bonus of blaspheming against Sarjilam at the same time. When Gyokuran demands permanent exile for Shion, Mokuren, after being \"ill\" for a week, steps up and demands Gyokuran let Shion out because the two of them are engaged.",

The next day, he tells Jinpachi during a heated argument that he is not going to give his password to anyone but Shion (Haruhiko).

Rin ends up using the other kid to form a gang of grade schoolers. Jinpachi, Issei and Alice, feeling better now, go to meet with Tamura and Haruhiko. There, Haruhiko comes clean, explaining that he is Shukaido, not Shion, and that Rin has been forcing him to pretend otherwise. He explains the horrible thing that Shukaido did to Shion on the moon base, giving Shion the only vaccine to the virus, forcing him to live another nine years alone. This is the real reason for Rin's age difference. Tamura then explains Rin's actions concerning the Tokyo Tower renovation as well. Afterwards, Jinpachi and Issei discuss the meeting with Haruhiko, eventually deciding that he is very brave to have come clean about his past reincarnation's terrible action. The next day, Alice begins hallucinating about the scientists at the temple they visit in Kyoto, causing her to faint and the cherry trees to bloom out of season. Jinpachi and Issei notice the Kiches mark appear on Alice's forehead and are finally convinced that Alice is the reincarnation of Mokuren, as she begins to dream of her past.",

        "Majima shows up at Dr. Mori's because one of his men has been shot. He comments about Rin, a kid, being at an illegitimate doctor's office. Alice begins dreaming of Mokuren's past. Mokuren's parents were both Kiches Sarjalians who lived and met in paradise. They decided to give up their Kiches and have Mokuren. When Mokuren was born with the Kiches mark on her forehead her parents were heartbroken. At three years old, Mokuren's grandparents came and stole her away from her parents and turned her over to the state. Later, her father snuck in to retrieve her and they ran from the government for a while, until her father's death. Her mother died soon after. Mokuren is then sent back to \"Paradise\", the state-controlled facility for the national treasures and religious icons known as Kiches Sarjalians. There she lives naked and removed from society, with no contact with other humans other than the Lim Lians and other Kiches. It is here that Mokuren first falls in love with KK. Soon after, Mokuren meets the Kiches Elder and receives her first Kiches prophecy. Frustrated, Mokuren decides to sneak out one day and meets a human boy named Sev Oru. Mokuren decides to use him to get rid of her Kiches, but Sev Oru's father is against this, and Sev Oru refuses. Some time later, Sev Oru frantically demands that Mokuren save his father, a circus performer, who was severely injured on the job. It is commonly known that Kiches have this power, but not that it only comes when they are older and more experienced than Mokuren. When she is unable to help him, Sev Oru's father dies and he turns his back on her. Mokuren is heartbroken.",

        "At the age of 20, Mokuren is finally allowed out into society to go to graduate school. She cannot seem to make any female friends, although the boys love her. She performs regularly as the prima Kiches Sarjalian soloist. Mokuren hears one day that a new team is being formed to go to the base on ZKK-101. Mokuren vows to be part of that team, and petitions the Kiches Elder. The Elder approves her request and gives a second prophecy, that she will be reborn somehow on this mission. Mokuren meets with the rest of the team hoping to start over with these people and actually make friends. She also hopes some of them will be cute. Mokuren does one final performance as a Kiches before leaving with the team to ZKK-101, with the other scientists (minus Shion) in attendance. On the moon base, Mokuren gets along fairly well with the others, although Shion seems to take pleasure in tormenting her. She accidentally commits a few faux pas, to the embarrassment of Shion and Gyokuran. Despite this, Mokuren seems drawn to Shion and tries to reach out to him. When she shows him visions of his childhood, however, he becomes angry and accuses her of giving him false visions. He later pretends to apologise for being so mean to her and proceeds to mock her with a vision of a pig's butt.",

        "After Shion mistreats her, Mokuren goes into the greenhouse to sing to the plants to console herself. The next day, the entire moon base is overgrown with weeds, which have also caused Shion's computers to break. Shion becomes even more furious with her, while everyone works at removing the weeds. Again and again, Shion is mean to Mokuren and she makes the plants grow, forcing the others to clean up the mess. Mokuren gets drunk one night and Gyokuran tries to convince her that Shion actually likes her despite his behavior. Later, she gets notification that the Kiches Elder has died. In her death message to Mokuren, the Elder reminds her of the second prophecy, that Mokuren will experience a rebirth. Mokuren frets that she should return to Shia and Gyokuran kisses her and asks her to marry him. Mokuren hesitates, thinking of Shion instead, and Gyokuran retracts his offer, knowing that Kiches cannot get married. Finally, Alice dreams of the Homeworld being destroyed. Everyone is beside themselves. They look to Mokuren as a representative of a higher authority to do something about it, but she cannot, and feels trapped. Shion eventually suggests they all go down to Earth. Mokuren initially agrees, but the others do not and, after pressing Shusuran too far, Shion gets thrown in the brig for dissenting. Mokuren tries to reason with him several times while bringing him dinner, and Gyokuran warns her to stay away from him. Alice awakens and hesitates about dreaming more; she knows the event of her rape is looming before her and she does not want to relive it. Issei, having seen a projection of Shion crying from Alice's dream, comments to Jinpachi about how Shion always seemed to be especially nice to Enju, to care about her.",

        "Shion makes Mokuren an offer: \"I love you, give up your Kiches (virginity) and I will do whatever it takes to make peace with Gyokuran.\" As Mokuren ponders her answer, she becomes excited by the prospect that Shion loves her. Alice then wakes up in a panic. The police come looking for Mikuro and Hokuto calls up Tamura, telling him he cannot use Mikuro anymore. Rin calls Daisuke, pretending to be Jinpachi and trying to use the truth, that Rin is Shion, to get Hiiragi's password. When this does not work, Rin extorts the password out of him by drowning Daisuke's brother. Later, Jinpachi calls Daisuke to tell him about their meeting with Haruhiko, but too late, Daisuke has given up Hiiragi's password. Now, only Mokuren's is safe. The gang frets about how to protect Alice from Rin. They meet with Tamura at a restaurant and decide to take Alice hotel hopping. Meanwhile, Alice freaks out over her dreams and runs out of the apartment. As Tamura and Haruhiko leave the restaurant, Majima appears and shoots Tamura. Majima tells Tamura about the true circumstances surrounding his brother's death as he looms over him mockingly. Haruhiko comes up and screams at Majima, as Mikuro appears behind Majima and sends him into the air to \"cool off\". Majima is shocked to see that Tamura has such powerful people working for him. They leave; Haruhiko goes to the store while Mikuro and Tamura talk and runs into Alice. He talks with her about the moon dreams and encourages her to finish her moon dreaming so that she can hopefully defuse Rin by telling him Mokuren does not love him. But Alice reveals that she simply does not want to re-experience Mokuren's agony over the fact that Shion does not love her.",

Haruhiko comes up and screams at Majima, as Mikuro appears behind Majima and sends him into the air to \"cool off\". Majima is shocked to see that Tamura has such powerful people working for him. They leave; Haruhiko goes to the store while Mikuro and Tamura talk and runs into Alice. He talks with her about the moon dreams and encourages her to finish her moon dreaming so that she can hopefully defuse Rin by telling him Mokuren does not love him. But Alice reveals that she simply does not want to re-experience Mokuren's agony over the fact that Shion does not love her.",
        "Shion makes Mokuren an offer: \"I love you, give up your Kiches (virginity) and I will do whatever it takes to make peace with Gyokuran.\" As Mokuren ponders her answer, she becomes excited by the prospect that Shion loves her. Alice then wakes up in a panic. The police come looking for Mikuro and Hokuto calls up Tamura, telling him he cannot use Mikuro anymore. Rin calls Daisuke, pretending to be Jinpachi and trying to use the truth, that Rin is Shion, to get Hiiragi's password. When this does not work, Rin extorts the password out of him by drowning Daisuke's brother. Later, Jinpachi calls Daisuke to tell him about their meeting with Haruhiko, but too late, Daisuke has given up Hiiragi's password. Now, only Mokuren's is safe. The gang frets about how to protect Alice from Rin. They meet with Tamura at a restaurant and decide to take Alice hotel hopping.

        "Haruhiko and the others get Alice to the first hotel. She falls asleep, dreaming of the moon. Mokuren is ill after the rape, and Shusuran and Enju are with her, trying to console her. Mokuren remembers crying over the fact that Shion does not love her. Then she hears about Shion's pending permanent exile and goes to talk to Gyokuran. She declares quite forcefully that she is in love with Shion, and that they are to release him at once. Gyokuran eventually caves, and Shion moves in with Mokuren. As they sit down to talk, the emotional wall around him crumbles. Majima looks up psychic powers in a book store when he is approached by some children who ask him about an alliance with their \"hero\" (Rin) in order to finish Tamura off. Majima calls up Tamura to come meet with him, while Haruhiko and Mikuro go to the store. They see Rin. Mikuro chases him and finds out that he has just been had, as Tamura gets picked up by the police instead of meeting Majima. Haruhiko teleports back to the hotel room to tell the rest.

She spends some good time with Shion, followed by a seizure after he leaves, where Mokuren becomes frantic that she is about to die and pleads with KK to grant her \"one miracle\", like her mother had told her about when she was young.",

        "Alice uses Mokuren's power to break the forcefield Rin placed around Dr. Mori's house. Rin returns, surprised at this, and needing to get Alice out of there since Majima gave up the location. Alice tells Rin they should go to Tokyo Tower and destroy the moon base, giving him Mokuren's password: Shion's own name. Jinpachi appears, yelling at Rin, as the others come in behind him. Rin is overwhelmed and disappears after an explosion occurs. Alice, Mikuro, Jinpachi, Tamura and Haruhiko all teleport to Tokyo Tower. The others take a taxi. Rin fights Mikuro, while the others argue with him about what he is doing. He begins inputting the passwords through the device he had built during the renovation. As he enters the final password, Alice screams at Rin to blow the base up. Rin enters system code 999, self destruct, but the computer returns with the message \"unable to comply\". Confused and desperate, Rin tries again, with the same response. He remembers now the device that Shion built while alone on the moon base: a 3D holographic image of Mokuren singing, made from a video taken by Shusuran. The device continued playing on after Shion died and Mokuren's eternal resonating song caused the base to be overgrown with weeds and the computer to malfunction for the final time. Rin faints at this realization and falls from the top of Tokyo Tower. Gyokuran jumps to his rescue, teleporting him to safety, as Rin dreams of leaving the moon base, and Shion, behind. Yet again, Rin is in the hospital in a coma. When he wakes up, Alice confesses her absolute love for him, and Jinpachi is disappointed. The story concludes four years later, with Alice exchanging letters with Haruhiko, discussing what everyone is doing now.",

        "Another innovation by the whalers was the use of sonar to track whales they were pursuing underwater. But there was a problem; as the boat gained on the whale, the whale started exhaling while still submerged. This produced a cloud of bubbles in the water that reflected sound better than the whale did and made a false target (akin to what a pilot does when releasing metal chaff to create a false radar echo). I suspect that this behavior by whales was simply fortuitous since exhaling while still submerged is simply a means by which a whale can reduce the time it has to remain at the surface, where surface drag will slow it down. Whalers quickly discovered that a frequency of three thousand hertz seemed to panic the whales, causing them to surface much more often for air, This was a \u201cbetter\" use for sonar because it afforded the whalers more chances to shoot the whales. So they equipped their catcher boats with sonar at that frequency. Of course the sonar also allows the whalers to follow the whale underwater, but that is its secondary use. Its primary use is for scaring whales so that they start \u201cpanting\u201d at the surface."

John Wagstaffe (Currier Slack, Ashton) built and ran the mill with Edward Sidebottom until around 1840, when Sidebottom took over the neighbouring Robinson Street Mill. About 1853 added a second mill only 8 bays long. In 1874 these mills had 30,354 spindles about 10,000 of these were on semi automatic mules, reputedly better for very fine counts. There were 3 steam engines giving 110hp. The mill was extended by John Wagstaffe and Co Ltd and took 54126 including 5640 ring spindles spinning warp and weft from American. In 1905 it passed to Storrs Mill Co Ltd who increased the ring spindles to 11,280. Aqueduct Mill Co (1927) took the mill through the difficult times and by 1938 was converted entirely rings, with 31,424 spindles. Cords Ltd took over in 1949, they spun American and Egyptian and also viscose and moved over to produce carpet yarns from viscose, wool and nylon. Aqueduct Mills were demolished in 1984.",

The next combined mill was built in 1824, then a warehouse was built and converted to spinning in 1832. By then they had six steam engines delivering 158hp and employed 1300. A further multi-storey mill was added about 1850 and the weaving sheds expanded. The expansion stopped about 1872 and in 1884 they contained 1855 looms and 102,000 spindles.It became a limited company in 1903 and started to introduce ring frames. By 1913 it has 33,400 ring spindles and 47,000 mule spindles and 1824 looms. The 1920s were bad. It was bought out in 1929 by the Lancashire Cotton Corporation, who had closed and demolished all the building with exception of the Clock Tower Mill, by 1934. This continued in cotton until 1955.",

        "Notes: An Arkwright type mill built on the Tame by Faulkner., Brown and Etchell in 1788. It was a five storey mill 17 yds by 9.5 yds. It started with water frames. A second mill was added in 1804 by Ousey- it was designed for mule spinning, being 3.5 yds wider. In 1806 a combination of Mule and Throstle spinning was being done with 24 mules carrying 6072 spindles, 16 throstles carrying 1,664 spindles and 15 carding engines. A third fireproof mill had been added by the new tenants Judson Ousey. So in 1830, the 52 throstle frames were producing 1000 lbs of twist yarn a week and the 30 mules producing 1000lbs of weft a week. They were converted into a print works around 1850 and known as the Harthead Works. The mills came into the hands of the Calico Printers Association and were demolished around 1930.",

        "Notes: Built on the Tame on the Cheshire side upstream from Lower Mill originally as a fulling mill for woollen, it was in place by 1775. It came over to cotton around 1803 when it contained 4,800 spindles, hosting James Boyer and William Earnshaw, probably using throstles. One part was four storeys of 68ft by 28ft, and the other was three storeys of 38ft by 40ft. The fall on the river at that point was 13 ft. The first fire was in 1827, but the rebuilt mill was occupied by James Hall, of King Street Mill in 1836, and steam power was being used. The second fire here was in March 1873 when a centre shaft on the third floor overheated and 60 people lost their jobs. Only 11,000 spindles of a possible 30,000 were in use. The site was obtained by the North of England Paper Manufacturing Company, that was incorporated in 1874. The new multi-storey paper mill building was standing 1990.",

In 1833 Harrisons had 220hp of steam, from four engines, 3 of which were Boulton & Watt and 15hp from a waterwheel. They employed 1300, of which 750 were weaving. John Lees with his son Jeremiah took the rebuilt new mill, and expanded i 1816,1820, 1821 etc. These mills were run by John Lee and Son until 1847. They had 110hp from 3 engines employing 796 hands. They were taken over by Henry Johnson and Sons, cotton spinners and manufacturers of shirtings and printing cloth. They built the Johnsons Side Mills on the Cheshire side of the River Tame in 1854, a 3 storey spinning block and more weaving sheds. In the 1870s the London & North-Western Railway bought most of the mills on the Lancashire side and demolished them for a goods yard that was never constructed. Some mills transferred to James Hall, Son & Co, but became disused in the 1880s and were demolished. The remaining mills became owned by Thomas Ashton Harrison & Co. There was more expansion for example off Caroline Street. In 1911 there were running 1,347 looms, 27,000 mule spindles and 44,000 ring spindles. By 1921 they were running 1,356 looms weaving domestics, plains, twills and sheeting, and spinning medium counts of twist and weft from American on 8400 mule and 58,600 ring spindles.

John Lees with his son Jeremiah took the rebuilt new mill, and expanded i 1816,1820, 1821 etc. These mills were run by John Lee and Son until 1847. They had 110hp from 3 engines employing 796 hands. They were taken over by Henry Johnson and Sons, cotton spinners and manufacturers of shirtings and printing cloth. They built the Johnsons Side Mills on the Cheshire side of the River Tame in 1854, a 3 storey spinning block and more weaving sheds. In the 1870s the London & North-Western Railway bought most of the mills on the Lancashire side and demolished them for a goods yard that was never constructed. Some mills transferred to James Hall, Son & Co, but became disused in the 1880s and were demolished. The remaining mills became owned by Thomas Ashton Harrison & Co. There was more expansion for example off Caroline Street. In 1911 there were running 1,347 looms, 27,000 mule spindles and 44,000 ring spindles. By 1921 they were running 1,356 looms weaving domestics, plains, twills and sheeting, and spinning medium counts of twist and weft from American on 8400 mule and 58,600 ring spindles. They closed in 1933. The mills on the Lancashire side were demolished, while the Caroline Street mills are still standing.",
        "Notes: A collective term for all the mills at Rassbottom in Stalybridge. These include Lees', Harrisons', Hencote, Water Street Mill, Castle Street Mills. It was presumed that it was the water power potential of this site that attracted the Lees brother and Harrison that purchased the site from Samuel Ousley in July 1795. They had already built up capital from cotton elsewhere. Chapel Street Mill 1797, bought a 40hp Bateman & Sherratt steam engine in 1899. With a second mill, they had 34,000 spindles in 1803 making it the largest concern in Stalybridge or Ashton. A fire on 28 December 1804 destroyed the older mill. Lees & Harrison rebuilt the mill with 24,960 mule spindles. George Cheetham and John Leech left the partnership and built a mill on Castle Street. By 1816 Lees and Harrison split, Harrison running the older mill with his sons, The Harrisons expanded and added a new 6 storey mill fronting Chapel Street with a 80hp Boulton & Watt engine with a 7 ft stroke running a 24 ft flywheel. They bought more engines and retired the Bateman & Sherratt to King Street where it ran until 1859. In 1833 Harrisons had 220hp of steam, from four engines, 3 of which were Boulton & Watt and 15hp from a waterwheel. They employed 1300, of which 750 were weaving.

The mill was slightly altered to allow construction of Park Road in the 1850s. Owners changed and in November 1880 the mill suffered a serious fire. It was expanded again in 1891, and then in 1894 Sidney Stott built a further mill extension, with Adamson boilers. The older buildings were redundant- it appears the plan was to demolish them and extend the extension into a full mill. In 1895 there were 52000 mule spindles, of which 45000 continued in operation to 1953. The Stott mill was still standing in 1993."

This ceased following a fire in 1983 and it was taken over in 1975 by Sammy-Woodland Ltd for scarf manufacture. Finally closed 1994 and demolished 1995. The steam engine was saved and is at Bolton.
