After Silas reminds Heylia he helped Conrad improve the MILF strain, Heylia agrees to supply Nancy. However, Silas will live with Heylia and help grow the crops. After Doug\u2019s company refuses to give Andy start-up money, Shane gives him $80,000 so Andy\u2019s business can serve as a front for Nancy\u2019s operation. While taking classes in applied criminology, Shane impresses an adjunct professor and NYPD investigator with his observational skills. Scott arranges for Nancy to visit Stevie before she returns to NYC."

        "Celia goes to suburban therapy clinic. Celia helps an airline pilot admit his cocaine abuse problem. Just as she is about to open up emotionally, she is sent to a less exclusive program because she doesn't have health insurance. Doug tries to have sex with Maria quickly, but she insists that he must win her affection. Andy gives him courtship advice; however, Maria is turned off by Doug's boorish personality, hatred for his ex-wife, and admission that he embezzled money. Silas and Lisa start selling pot disguised inside sandwiches. As the business grows, Silas asks Nancy for money to start a grow house. Nancy discovers that Shane had sex with Simone and Harmony. She admonishes him for having sex at age 13. When he says, \"Stop pretending to be a mom,\" she spanks him. Later, she discovers that the tunnel is being used to smuggle heroin into the US and guns into Mexico. Nancy expresses her reservations about working the tunnel to Esteban. He tries to reassure Nancy that the drug trade is \"how I build schools and hospitals.\" Nancy replies: \"It's not enough.\" After Esteban denies children are moving through the tunnel, Nancy calls Capt.

        "Nancy returns to her hometown of Dearborn, Michigan and calls upon her old high school teacher Warren Schiff (with whom she also had an affair) to help hide her family while they secure fake passports. Warren feeds Silas' curiosity about his teen-aged mother. After meeting Lars, Nancy's high school boyfriend, Silas starts to doubt that Judah was his real father. Shane swipes Lars's hair brush to order a DNA test. Andy tries and fails to acquire passports; however, he manages to trade the RV with a family who was living out of their car.

Quoting Nancy: \"I think you re-invented the Quaalude.\" Ellis is revealed to have been tracking the Botwins, and makes a phone call to an unknown person to say that he has found them.",
