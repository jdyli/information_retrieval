The ratio of the width to the length of ensign shall be one to two. The colour blue is symbolic of the sea, the crescent and stars are from the State Flag and the eight pointed star represents the mariner's compass.\""

After taking out the Buglers, they go after the last energy thief, revealed to be a being named Enter, as he escapes them and infects a power shovel to create the Metaloid Shovelloid. At the Energy Management Center, a new member to the Special Operations Unit named Miho Nakamura arrives prior to Shovelloid's attack on the city being detected in the city's Miyawa district. As the Buddyloid Usada Lettuce explains to Miho what their branch and the Vaglass are, Ryuji and Yoko head out to face the Metaloid. Alerted to the countdown to the arrival of a Vaglass Megazord, Blue Buster and Yellow Buster are unable to stop the Metaloid in time as the Shovelzord appears. Things seem hopeless as the Megazord attacks the Enetron Facility until, after seeing his hospitalized sister about making his decision to fight for everyone's sake, Hiromu contacts the Energy Management Center to launch the CB-01 Cheetah. Transforming into Red Buster, Hiromu and Nick enter the CB-01 and transform the car into the Megazord Go-Buster Ace to fight the Shovelzord. Using its Buster Animal mode to catch its opponent off guard, Go-Buster Ace destroys Shovelzord as Blue Buster and Yellow Buster shutdown the Shovelloid."

Later, the Go-Busters are alerted to Enter's arrival in the Hayashibara district as he creates Denshaloid with a Vaglass Megazord prepared to be transported into the city within thirty minutes. As the Go-Busters arrive, Enter reveals his intent to use Denshaloid to gather enough Enetron to produce more Metaloids and in turn get more Vaglass Megazords deployed. After taking out the Buglers blocking their path, the Go-Busters learn that Go-Buster Ace has suffered an Enetron malfunction as Hiromu draws back and learns that it was Koyama's fault for not properly checking the charging system. Later, Cheeda Nick tries to convince his partner that Koyama is not all bad, but Hiromu is still upset. Blue Buster and Yellow Buster intercept Denshaloid and derail it so it can run into Red Buster who fights it before he suddenly freezes at the sight of a chicken-shaped weather vane. Luckily, the others arrive to destroy the weather vane and enable him to catch up the Metaloid. The three Go-Busters proceed to overwhelm Denshaloid before they destroy him. By that time, the Denshazord arrives with two Bugzords to assume a train formation to get to an Enetron tank.

        "After returning some Enetron on his own, Usada finds himself being kidnapped. Learning of this, Hiromu and Ryuji are forced to reveal their attempt to help Yoko with her homework caused Usada to blow a fuse as his resulting ranting on her inability to do anything right without him caused the Buddyloid and her to have a major fall out. Tracking Usada's signal, the Go-Busters track the Buddyloid to his location while, however, having hacked into the phone system, Enter overhears the ransom and decides to kidnap Usada for his agenda of utilizing the BC-04 blue prints. Using his Buglers to fend the Go-Busters off, Enter spirits Usada off while leaving a bomb to cover his tracks. After taking the kidnappers to the proper authorities, the Go-Busters learn that Enter blocked Usada's signal as he hacks the TV airwaves to deliver his demands for 20,000 Enetron within the hour or he will detonate the bomb on Usada. As the Energy Management Center is washing their hands on the matter, the Go-Busters are on their own with Yoko having an idea. Using a truck, with Morishita and Miho respectively posing as Hiromu and her, Yoko makes her move as Enter summons a pair of Bugzords from what remained of the Drillzord with the Go-Busters seemingly forced to deal with the Megazord. Inspecting the truck, Enter finds it filled with only water before seeing Yoko saving Usada. With Enter speeding up the detonation timer in response, with them arguing over whose safety is more important, Usada and Yoko admit their refusal to see the other die before the chain breaks and the Buddyloid is seemingly destroyed in the blast.

        "After taking out an army of Buglers, with Blue Buster's Weakpoint taking effect during the fight, the Go-Busters learn that the grunts are a distraction used by Enter so he enter the Sawatari district to steal a crate holding 500 tons of the metal alloy known as Deltanium 39 so he can build the BC-04. Realizing that using a Megazord to transport the alloy to Messiah is the next phase of Enter's plans, the Go-Busters are placed on standby. In the interim, Nick tries to get Hiromu to see his sister Rika's new art exhibition, but Hiromu refuses to go. Nick decides that it should be his job to try to square things out between the brother and sister, even though Rika despises him. Though he gets lost in near the \u014cmae district, Nick finds Rika as he tries to convince her of the importance of Hiromu fighting Vaglass. However, believing that he and the EMC purposely drafted Hiromu to their case, she accuses him that all he wants to do is break her family up. Before he can say anything, Nick gets alerted of a Metaloid sighting with a Vaglass Megazord's arrival within 30 minutes. And on top of that, the Deltanium 39 crate is guarded by Meta-Cell infected humans. As the GT-02 prepares confront the Megazord, with the RH-03 attempting to get to the crate, Hiromu arrives to the building as Nick arrives with Rika, much to his dismay. Though she tries to convince him to quit being a Go-Buster, Hiromu ignores her in order to save a family with a young child and then tells her that he fights the Vaglass because it was his decision to join the Go-Busters. He leaves his sister to transform and enter a nearby building to stop the Deltanium 39 theft. Racing upstairs, Red Buster is confronted by the Metaloid Danganloid, as Enter speaks to him over an intercom to explain that the Metaloid was made just for fighting him. Danganloid manages to overpower Red Buster in a high speed battle, matching the Go-Buster's every move. Upon the Danganzord's arrival, as Nick explains to Rika of Hiromu's resolve to ensure no family ever suffers as they have by the Vaglass, Red Buster manages to use Danganloid's speed to destroy him as Yellow Buster knocks out the Meta-Cell infected people. Though Red Buster and Nick manage to save a Meta-Cell inflected boy, the Danganzord manages to transport the crate into subspace. With the mission over, Enter deletes the Meta-Cells just as he leaves. As Rika now understands her brother upon seeing the family reunited, Red Buster enters the CB-01 to join the fight. Forming Go-Buster Oh, the Go-Busters destroy the Danganzord. Hiromu and Nick try to track down Rika later, but they cannot find her, only to find a sketch book with a drawing the Sakurada family and an animalized Nick, Rika's way of accepting the Buddyloid into the family.",

However, while cornering Enter when he is about to obtain Enetron, the safety device's warning signal disrupts team's concentration before Enter entangles him in his tendrils. But after seeing Blue Buster overheat, Enter decides to take his leave, much to everyone's confusion. Gorisaki frets over what happened as Nick and Usada try to assure him that Ryuji will not be mad at him. Although that is the case, even after his later attempt to modify the safety device with a cooling function, Gorisaki goes to the top of a building after seeing Usada and Nick being close with their human partners. Joined by Nick, Gorisaki confides in him that he is a bit jealous of him and Usada for having made such relationships with their partners while feeling that Ryuji is holding back his feelings. The two Buddyloids are soon alerted to a Vaglass Megazord sighting within seven minutes. Taking Gorisaki's device with him, Ryuji and the other Go-Busters arrive to the Kameno district where they are ambushed by the Metaloid Fanloid and his powerful wind gusts. After being informed of the Megazord's arrival within a minute, Red Buster enters Go-Buster Ace to battle the Fanzord while leaving his teammates to deal with Fanloid. After having Yellow Buster leave to aid Go-Buster Ace in the RH-03, only for her and Usada to get blown away, Blue Buster finds himself in a jam as his Weakpoint begins to manifest.

Refusing to allow it to happen, Gorisaki goes against orders to cover Blue Buster so he can damage the Metaloid's fan and destroy him. A mortified Enter teleports away as Gorisaki collapses from the strain from the Metaloid's attack. Screaming at his Buddyloid for doing such a stupid thing, Ryuji realizes that Gorisaki wanted him to open up to him. With the GT-02 Gorilla's arrival, Go-Buster Ace manages to destroy the Fanzord. Soon after, upon giving the device back to Gorisaki while expressing how annoying it is, Ryuji promises to be more open with Gorisaki about his feelings. Agreeing to do the same, Gorisaki mistakenly expresses of all Ryuji's character flaws before his partner chases the Buddyloid around with the others watching.",

        "Since the incident with the Fanzord, Yoko has been going through simulation training to improve herself while Miho is astonished to find Yoko does nothing else but train and sleep. The Megazord Development Facility then contacts Kuroki of Vaglass's next move to obtain a crystal used for their Megazords' optics. Though the material of the ore can not manifest in Japan, such crystals are being brought into the country by Hong Kong pop idol Angie Sue, whom everyone realizes is the spitting image of Yoko. Three days later at the Rinto district, the Go-Busters assume positions around the conference for Angie's upcoming movie as they are alerted to a Metaloid with a Vaglass Megazord to appear in four hours and thirty minutes. Despite Yoko detecting the Metaloid nearby, the signal suddenly vanishes before Ryuji saves Angie from a crazed woman that Hiromu holds off. The woman turns out to be the Metaloid Copyloid as the confused Go-Busters fight him. However, managing to outrun the Go-Busters, Copyloid assumes a businessman's form to elude them. Realizing what has occurred and that the Metaloid will attack the conference in conjunction to the Megazord attack, the Go-Busters are forced to head for the conference. But Angie mentions that she wants to fulfill her dream of becoming an international star before Yoko insults her dreams.

Before taking his leave, Masato tells the Go-Busters if they will, it will be once they are strong enough to face Messiah in subspace, while noticing Ryuji's reaction to his teammates' resolve. Meeting with Ryuji alone, Masato confronts the man about him losing his desire to become an engineer and what gives him the drive to fight. After stating that keeping his word to Hiromu and Yoko is all the reason he needs, Ryuji receives a call from Kuroki for him and Masato to arrive to the Iwaguchi district to give the latter a supply of 2000 tons of Enetron.

However, as Go-Buster Ace and the RH-03 are deployed to fight it, the Forkzord releases the new model Megazord, Type Delta, which is based on BC-04's specs, from its body. As Go-Buster Oh is defeated by the Type Delta Megazord and the Forkzord, the Beet and Stag Busters finish Forkloid off before coming to Blue Buster's aid as he uses the GT-02 Gorilla to shield the others from the enemy Megazords' attack.

Motivated to become an engineer again once the Vaglass are defeated, Blue Buster uses the GT-02 to siphon the remaining Enetron reserves of Go-Buster Ace and the RH-03 to help the BC-04 Beetle and SJ-05 Stag Beetle destroy the Forkzord. From there, Beet Buster activates the BC-04 Beetle's transformation into Go-Buster Beet, and proceeded to shut down the new Megazord. As a mortified Enter teleports away, Masato gives Ryuji engineering books before taking the man's money as payment for the books.

After having Beet Buster lower the BC-04's crane down, Red Buster has Go-Buster Ace use the BC-04 to reel the Megazord back up to the surface. With the RH-03 Rabbit supporting the GT-02 Gorilla in destroying the Bugzords, and while Go-Buster Ace takes out the ones below, the SJ-05 Stag Beetle carries Drillzord 2 into the city as Go-Buster Beet fights the Vaglass Megazord before finishing it off. Soon after, Masato goes ballistic on Jay for blabbering about the orders he gave him to help Yoko."

While there, the Go-Busters encounter the Metaloid Filmloid as he creates copies of the Go-Busters. The Go-Busters fight their copies until the Filmzord arrives and creates a barrier around its surroundings. After Filmloid teleports away once his copies are defeated, Masato and Jay arrive to reveal the barrier the Filmzord has created is a projection of subspace. He has been called in by Kuroki to reveal that the nature of subpace, Masato offers their only chance is to modify Go-Buster Oh to combine with the BC-04 Beetle and SJ-05 Stag Beetle so it can enter subspace and destroy the Megazord. Masato oversees the process, while warning Hiromu that it may cause him physical harm as he is the main pilot of the Megazord. The next day, with Masato and the Buster Machine crew still continuing their work, Yoko confronts Hiromu about the risks he is taking. He assures her that it would be okay and that that must save everyone. Alerted to Filmloid in the Iwatani district, the Go-Busters arrive and defeat the Buglers before Filmloid uses his projection ability to have them see their deepest desire in his new Sweet Dreams attack.

Great Go-Buster then is deployed into the subspace projection, and they fight the Filmzord before destroying it.

Though it is discovered to be a prank call, chances cannot be taken as Hiromu and Yoko enter incognito and learn that the prank was done by a boy named Sh\u014dta Segawa who has also joined the escape game with his friends Kaito and Rin. By that time, Escape makes her way into the hotel's parking lot and brings Keyloid to life as he proceeds to lock down the entire building. Having witnessed his action, Blue Buster fights Keyloid before Beet Buster and Stag Buster arrive for support. Inside, Escape and a group of Buglers hold the people hostage with Hiromu and Yoko forced to drop their cover when she is about to kill Sh\u014dta. Tricked into thinking that the Go-Busters are weak, a disappointed Escape takes her leave as she informs everyone that a Vaglass Megazord will come in 17 minutes to destroy the building. But upon learning that Keyloid's attack has been cancelled once his key arm has been broken off, a furious Escape orders the Buglers to keep everyone from leaving the building. After confronting Sh\u014dta about his need to be cool and their acting weak, Hiromu gets the boys to safety and Hiromu tells Sh\u014dta not to let others judge him and to trust himself before Escape and Keyloid arrive. With Sh\u014dta taking his friends to safety, the assembled Go-Busters transform to fight Escape and Keyloid with Enter overseeing the fight, all the while lamenting of having overstimulated Messiah. After Keyloid is destroyed, the Keyzord arrives and projects subspace around itself. Great Go-Buster is formed to venture into the barrier and the group successfully destroys the Keyzord. As Escape takes her leave, Sh\u014dta apologizes to his friends for putting them in danger and they all forgive him.",

        "Masato arrives at the Energy Management Center with a flower bouquet for Yoko on her birthday, and he reveals that he worked with Yoko's mother as the test pilot of the Megazords they built. Elsewhere, after pestering Enter over his meeting with Messiah and telling him they will now work together, Escape takes a child's toy magnet to create Jisyakuloid and cause suffering in the Iwagami district with his power to magnetize people. The Go-Busters are deployed to Jisyakuloid's location, with Hiromu and Cheeda Nick arriving first and getting magnetized. The other Go-Busters transform and battle Jisyakuloid and the Buglers before Jay and Ryuji end up magnetized, as well, before the Metaloid escapes when Beet Buster attempts to hit his Weakpoint. As the others are taken back to the Energy Management Center, Masato sees Yoko's mother in her when she tries to cheer a girl up whose is separated from her mother by Jisyakuloid's magnetism. Elsewhere, as Jisyakuloid repairs his face, the Jisyakuzord arrives and siphons an Enetron tank. With Gorisaki sending them prototype GB-Protection suits to make them immune to Jisyakuloid's attack, Masato and Yoko track down the Metaloid in the Kitamura district. However, Escape arrives and destroys Masato's protection suit as he and Yoko take cover. It is at this time that Yoko learns that Masato's physical body stuck in subspace suffers whatever physical harm his avatar endures. Refusing to let him sacrifice himself for her mother's sake, Yoko knocks Masato out and charges Escape head on while changing into Yellow Buster, as the others drive her off. With Masato covering, Yellow Buster destroys Jisyakuloid's magnetic hair as the assembled Go-Busters finally destroy the Metaloid from all sides. Forming Go-Buster Oh, the Go-Busters hold the Jisyakuzord off while Buster Beet magnetizes the Enetron tank to retrieve he stolen Enetron, right before Go-Buster Oh destroys the Vaglass Megazord. Soon after, upon seeing the girl and her mother reunited, Masato admits that Yoko reminds him of her mother. Watching him leave, Ryuji worries about Masato's real intentions for risking his life.",

When they arrive at the summer festival, Ryuji and Yoko find Nick helping performers with Hiromu amongst them. Seeing the others, not having told them that he is a Go-Buster, Hiromu reveals that they are old middle school friends from a street performance club who need his help. Soon after, the Go-Busters are alerted to a Metaloid attack in the Shishida district with a Vaglass Megazord coming in 55 minutes. However, when Hiromu's teacher Ms. Kyoko Shitara arrives, Ryuji and Yoko decide to go without him to meet up with Masato and Jay as they fight Enter and Wataameloid.

The Go-Busters wait until Wataameloid is detected, again, with the Wataamezord arriving three minutes later. As the others hold Wataameloid off, Red Buster saves Ms. Shitara while Go-Buster Beet and the SJ-05 fend off the Wataamezord.

Hiding his apparent failure, Enter tells them to be more concerned with the Vaglass Megazord coming in 32 minutes. As the Go-Busters and the control staff go their separate ways so Morishita and Nakamura can track down the Metaloid, Keshigomuloid latches unto Hiromu and uses him to erase the Energy Management Center's data undetected.

Soon after Nakamura's attempt to give him back his pencil she borrowed earlier, Hiromu joins the others Go-Busters in deploying the Buster Machines to face the Keshigomuzord before it erased the Megazords' combine program before the GT-02's Animal Mode could hit the Type-Delta Megzaord. However, the BC-04 and SJ-05 arrive with Go-Buster Beet unable to form Buster Hercules. Back at the Energy Management Center, losing her cool and usual shyness, Nakamura suggests a manual combination by herself and Morishita. Going through the blueprints as the Megazords battle, Nakamura learns of Keshigomuloid as Kuroki deals with the pint-sized menace to give his aides time. Back at the fight, the SJ-05 combines with Go-Buster Ace to form Go-Buster Ace Stag Custom which destroys the Type Delta Megazord. By that time, with Go-Buster Beet holding the Keshigomuzord off, the Go-Busters manually form Go-Buster Oh on Nakamura's instructions as Morishita takes over after Kuroki loses consciousness from Keshigomuloid's headbutt. As Go-Buster Oh destroys the Keshigomuzord, Red Buster arrives in time to blast Keshigomuloid. Later, Nakamura gives Hiromu's pencil back to him, though he admits that she scares him now.",
        "At the Numaoka district, Enter uses a eraser in a vacant classroom to create a Metaloid, finding it odd that the transfiguration did not occur and tossed what he thought was a normal eraser as the resulting Vaglass Megazord begins to be transferred into reality. But it turns out that the eraser did transform into the pint-sized Keshigomuloid, running after his creator before finding him being confronted by the Go-Busters.

        "Unable to find Messiah, and alerted by the engineers that their leader is in pain, Enter realizes that he is still evolving despite the Go-Busters' interference. Confronted by Escape in the Segawa district over why she can not connect with Messiah, Enter assures her that he has found a new purpose while creating Sprayloid 2 to cause confusion with the aided task to find out Red Buster's Weakpoint. Elsewhere, Hiromu and Cheeda Nick are about to attend Rika's party after winning a prize for the children's book she has been working on, even though she put a chicken on the cover. They are about to reach the reception when they are alerted that Sprayloid 2 is attacking, while Nick is worried about the chicken drawings in Rika's book. The pair confronts Sprayloid 2 when the Metaloid uses his appearance-altering spray to make Nick look like Hiromu. The other Go-Busters arrive on the scene to fight Sprayloid 2's Buglers, all the while he uses his spray paint to change everyone's appearances, confusing everyone in the fight. Beet J. Stag arrives on the scene, ready to fight anyone he thinks is with Vaglass without asking questions first, but he accidentally splashes the gang with water, washing away Sprayloid 2's paint. Meanwhile, Sprayloid 2 has seen Nick taking Rika away from the fight, so he uses the opportunity to disguise himself as her and he manages to trick Nick into revealing that Hiromu's Weakpoint is seeing a chicken. Upon realizing he has been duped, he tries to lie about what he said, but Beet Buster arrives and drives Sprayloid 2 off. After Hiromu takes Rika to the hospital, Nick reveals to the group that Hiromu's Weakpoint is derived from a phobia he gained as a child. The group is soon alerted that Sprayloid 2 is attacking the Asami district in an attempt to call out the Go-Busters to confirm Red Buster's Weakpoint. The Go-Busters arrive on the scene, but Hiromu has not transformed. He charges Sprayloid 2 head on, despite the various images of chickens in the area to try to trigger his Weakpoint. However, Hiromu is entirely unaffected, until Sprayloid 2 realizes that his opponent is none other than Cheeda Nick in disguise. Sprayloid 2 manages to find the real Hiromu and tries to use the chicken image on him, but Hiromu's sunglasses allow him to block his sight in time, ruining Sprayloid 2's plans as the Metaloid is destroyed by the Go-Busters. As Nick washes Sprayloid 2's paint off, Buster Hercules is used to locate Sprayzord 2, which has been disguised as a skyscraper, before destroying it. Later, while seeing Rika off, Hiromu and Nick learn that two dogs in Rika's book are named Gog and Magog, the same names as Escape's weapons. Rika tells the two that she named the dogs after their mother's favorite statues. At the Energy Management Center, Masato reveals that the events that occurred were actually a distraction for the Vaglass forces in subspace to steal his Enetron supplies for Messiah who is creating a physical body with Enter witnessing his evolution.",

        "After having a nightmare involving Messiah, Cheeda Nick sees that Hiromu is still bothered by the connection between his mother and Escape. Hiromu is then alerted to a message from his father from subspace that says the Go-Busters are needed to stop Messiah with a portal in three hours. Though the others are relieved that their parents are alive, Hiromu is unconvinced until Masato reveals that Doctor Sakurada and the others were forced to help the Vaglass while he sent Beet J. Stag and his avatar to prepare the Go-Busters for the battle with Messiah. He tells them that they will find out the truth once they reach subspace. Despite not being prepared, the other Go-Busters decide that it is time to take the fight to Messiah in subspace. As Nakamura finds the signal of the teleportation, the Go-Busters receive a layout of the Transport Research Center as Great Go-Buster is formed to be launched in a 30 minute time frame. However, having learned that one of their engineers has been supporting the Go-Busters, Enter employs Escape's assistance as they stage an attack on the Buster Machine hangar. After the Buglers are defeated, Enter and Escape go all out, with the former separating Red Buster from the others so the entire team can not enter subspace. Once Great Go-Buster is formed with 21 minutes left for the marker to remain off, the other Go-Busters fall back to Hangar 02 with Escape at their heels. As for Red Buster, he is unable to outrun Enter as he is mortally wounded. However, motivated by his promise to his sister, Hiromu refuses to give in to the futility of the situation as Nick arrives to cover Hiromu's escape.

After the Go-Busters enter subspace, they are briefly shocked by the sight. They find themselves facing various Megazord models that Great Go-Buster manages to destroy.

        "When Vaglass was \"defeated\", the Go-Busters are surprised to be alerted to the appearance of a strange energy reading in the Deus district. The Go-Busters find a young woman being attacked by a strange monster before he takes his leave. The Go-Busters then turn to the young woman who introduces herself as Shelly, the partner of Space Sheriff Gavan who has been recently deployed to protect Earth. Taking her to the Energy Management Center, Shelly reveals that the monster they saved her from is Rhino Doubler of the Space Mafia Makuu and that she was separated from Gavan while in pursuit of the Double Monster. As the others look for the Double Monster, Yoko takes Shelly out to look for Gavan before they are attacked by Rhino Doubler with Yellow Buster holding the Double Monster off as he sends the girls into Makuu Space. While trying to look for the ladies, Morishita confirms that the Vaglass are still active as a supply of Enetron is stolen from the Maria district with a Megazord arriving within 10 minutes. As Ryuji confronts the Metaloid Danganloid 2 before he and the Metaloid are also sucked into Makuu Space, Hiromu and Nick search for Yoko and Shelly before Cheeda Nick is jumped by a youth in black who demands where the latter is. Stopping, Hiromu learn the youth is Geki Jumonji, the current Space Sheriff Gavan before being alerted of the Makuu Space portal with Geki telling Hiromu to stay behind while he saves his friends. But they are jumped by Buglers as Beet Buster and Stag Buster summon their Megazord to fight Danganzord 2. As Hiromu becomes Red Buster to fight the Buglers, Geki dons the Gavan Type G combat suit. Convinced of his determination, Gavan lets Red Buster join him in Makuu Space as Go-Buster Beet covers them before forming Buster Hercules to destroy Danganzord 2. Arriving in the nick of time with the others to safety, Red Buster and Gavan battle Danganloid 2 and use a combination attack to destroy the Metaloid and return to Earth. Later, Geki convinces Kuroki to let him and Shelly stick around so they can work with the Go-Busters to find Rhino Doubler. Elsewhere, revealed he's still alive from the explosion of the Megazord Type Epsilon, Enter is still researching Rhino Doubler's Axial Divertor.",

However, though the Go-Busters and Gavan corner Rhino Doubler from all sides and overwhelm him, the Double Monster escapes when Stag Buster's energy reserves run low. Back at the base, after overhearing Geki's commenting with Shelly about how the Go-Busters lack teamwork, a depressed Morishita is approached by Nakamura who unknowingly convinced him to help their team by researching a way for the Go-Busters to contact them if they end up in Makuu Space again. Turning to the Dimensional Research Center for help in modifying the signal of the Morphin Braces, Morishita is sucked into Makuu Space along with the scientists as part of Rhino Doubler's goal to remove the best people from Earth. Though trapped in a cage, Morishita gives morale to the scientists as they continue the signal modification. After learning of the scientists' abduction, the Go-Busters and Gavan find Rhino Doubler at Central Stadium as he was about to go after the athletes. Sucked into Makuu Space along with Gavan, the Go-Busters are shocked to find the Double Monster having support from Enter. The Go-Busters and Gavan find themselves at a disadvantage against Enter and Rhino Doubler in battles that defy normal physics. Separated from the others, Blue Buster and Yellow Buster rescue Morishita and the scientists. After rejoining the others, with Beet Buster and Stag Buster giving him time to complete the loading, Morishita contact the Energy Management Center and have the Go-Busters regain access to their gear.

However, upon returning to their dimension, Enter installs a Metavirus into Rhino Doubler's lifeless body to convert the Double Monster into a data-based giant that opens a portal to a blended form of subspace and Makuu Space that threatens to engulf the entire world. But, with support from Gavan's mecha Dol, Great Go-Buster destroys Rhino Doubler to cancel the portal. Later, with their mission over and seeing the Go-Busters are not as dysfunctional as they thought, Geki and Shelly take their leave to patrol the Milky Way.

        "After the attack by the mysterious lion robot, Kuroki reveals that it is the design of the late Professor Saburo Hazuki, the man who conceived the framework for the Buster Machines. As the Go-Busters track the lion robot to the surrounding foothills, they find Enter going after a young woman. After driving Enter off, the woman reveals herself to be Mika Hazuki, the daughter of Professor Hazuki. She reveals the robot is the Buddyzord LT-06 Tategami Lioh and explains that it wishes to fight the Go-Busters, who she reveals she has a hatred for. Red Buster uses Go-Buster Ace against the robot, but is defeated by Tategami Lioh's Buddy Animal mode, revealing the lion's strength. Still bothered by Mika's words of why she hates the Go-Busters, Ryuji finds Masato as he presents the blueprints for the Buddyzord, a Megazord with the AI of a Buddyloid built into it. This inspires Ryuji and Masato to study the blueprints to discover more about it. Later, as Go-Buster Ace gets its rematch with Tategami Lioh, Ryuji confronts Mika about her father's reasons for creating the Buddyzord before Enter intervenes in the plans. Yellow Buster Powered Custom and Stag Buster hold him off while Ryuji and Masato take Mika to another location, revealing that Tategami Lioh is meant to dock with Go-Buster Ace. However, as the docking causes it to assume its true mode, Masato reveals that Tategami Lioh is actually testing Go-Buster Ace for its worth as its partner. As Ryuji and Masato explain that Professor Hazuki's intention was to give the Go-Busters hope, Go-Buster Ace manages to defeat Tategami Lioh and win its loyalty just as Enter appears in the Type Epsilon Megazord to attack both Megazords. After Tategami Lioh gives Go-Buster Ace an edge with its Buddy Vehicle mode, it requests Red Buster to personally pilot it as they destroy the Type Epsilon Megazord together. Emerging from Tategami Lioh, Hiromu appears with the Buddyzord's control system which was created from digitized copy of Professor's mind who thanks his daughter for looking after Tategami Lioh. With Mika's blessings, the Go-Busters take Tategami Lioh as their new ally.",

The group are then alerted to a Messiah Metaloid detected with multiple Megazords being instantly teleported to its location, the Higashi District East Dome where the martial arts tournament takes place. While the others hunt down the Metaloid, Go-Buster Ace confronts the first of the Messiah Megazords before it and its opponent are sucked into the stadium. Within, Hiromu and Nick learn they are in a pocket dimension called the Vaglass Dome and must engage the Messiah Megazord known as Domezord Alpha in a Megazord Deathmatch. Despite the Go-Busters' attempts, they neither reach Hiromu nor break into the stadium before seeing a live broadcast fighting Domezord Alpha with Enter as the commentary while revealing that this fight is to analyze Go-Buster Ace's data. Though Go-Buster Ace destroys Domezord Alpha with a lariat, Enter explains that Hiromu cannot leave the Battlespace until Go-Buster Ace defeats the remaining three. Within second, Go-Buster Ace is pitted against the tag-team duo Domezord Beta and Domezord Gamma before managing to get the latter to take out its teammate. After a failed attempt to sneak on a summoned Domezord Delta, Blue Buster and Yellow Buster assume Powered Custom mode to take out Buglers alongside Beet Buster and Stag Buster. Hearing that Tategami Lioh wants to help, now knowing the location of the Messiah Metaloid from their failed infiltration, Ryuji has an idea based on his researching earlier. With the Domezords overpowering Go-Buster Ace with their underhanded tag team, and Hiromu at his limits, Enter tells the two to stop as he asks Red Buster if he wants to give up. But when Red Buster refuses to throw the towel despite the odds, Go-Buster Ace gets its second wind as Tategami Lioh and the Buster Machines arrive outside the stadium and combine into Go-Buster King to force the dome to release the Battlespace's fighters while assuming his true form: Domeloid. After taking out the Domezords, Go-Buster King overwhelms Domeloid and letting Go-Buster Ace get payback with a flying lariat before Go-Buster King finishes the Messiah Metaloid off.

With Red Buster holding Enter at bay, Blue Buster finds Kenta defeating the Buglers before he runs away. Ryuji finds the boy and watches over him, waiting for the GT-02 to arrive, and he wins Kenta over by confirming the boy's dream to become an engineer. However, Kenta wants to prove himself to his father first so he can pursue his dream. Ryuji is then contacted by Hiromu who tells him the Messiah Card has fused into the boy's karate gloves. When Ryuji attempts to get Kenta to take the gloves off, Messiah takes over the boy's body as he proceeds to have everyone fight him to gather data. The other Go-Busters hold off Escape Evolve while Ryuji takes a beating as tries to reach through to Kenta, who manages to regain control of his body from Messiah. This forces the Messiah Card to use a nearby Enetron tank to become Karateloid as Ryuji becomes Blue Buster Powered Custom to fight him just as his Weakpoint takes effect. In the other fight, Enter spirits Escape away just as the Karatezord arrives. Go-Buster Ace and Buster Hercules battle the Megazord, ultimately destroying it, while Yellow Buster arrives to Ryuji's side and finishes the weakened Karateloid off.

However, a mysterious girl appears and steals Messiah Card 10 before leaving as quickly as she arrived, leaving behind her calling card that reads \"Thief Pink Buster\". The Go-Busters pursue, with Pink Buster eluding them before Buglers appear. As the Go-Busters deal with the Buglers, with Red Buster pleading with Pink Buster to give them the Messiah Card, Pink Buster sees all the Buglers arrive and she runs off with Red Buster in pursuit. As dawn breaks, Red Buster loses sight of Pink Buster as a young woman passes by him. Later, while getting intel on Pink Buster, the Go-Busters are alerted to a new Messiah Metaloid emerging in the Akechi district. As the others find Loupeloid as the man who had the Messiah Card is giving away his things, Hiromu is confronted by Pink Buster as he discovers she is the woman he saw before: Reika Saotome. Taking his Morphin Brace, Pink Buster forces Hiromu to help her with a job with the promise that she will give it back to him along with what appears to be Messiah Card 10. Hiromu reluctantly agrees and follows Pink Buster to the Mitsuyama district after visiting various places, and he eventually realizes that Reika is using him to lure in the Messiah Metaloid. Upon confronting her about it, Reika reveals that all she wants to do is to set things right after her theft.

        "Having killed Enter and intending to do the same with the Go-Busters, Escape battles the Go-Buster Megazords in the enhanced Megazord Zeta as Messiah's conscious surfaces and defeats Go-Buster Ace. After others save a gravely injured Hiromu, leaving despite he intent to continue, Megazord Zeta proceeds to summon ten Megazord models. As the others are better informed over the three waves of Megazords and as Go-Buster Ace is being repaired, a wounded Hiromu attempts to fight his way out of the infirmary before Nick snaps him out of it while telling him that he understands but he must also live. Once repairs are done, the Go-Busters head out to face the first wave of Vaglass Megazord with Nick piloting Go-Buster Ace to give Hiromu time to heal. After the first batch, two Alphas and two Betas, are destroyed as Megazord Zeta joins the fray as Gamma and Delta types arrive. Learning the Zeta-Type is attempting to assimilate the summoned Valgass Megazords, Go-Buster Oh and Buster Hercules destroy the second wave before the final wave, composing of each Megazord of the four main archetype, arrives. Even with the FS-O0 providing aid, Megazord Zeta absorbs the remaining Alpha, Beta, and Gamma types to evolve into the titanic Messiah Reboot. Reabsorbing Escape's data as he has no more need for her, Messiah Reboot overpowers the Go-Buster Megazords and attempt to assimilate the GT-02 and the RH-03 until Red Buster arrives in Tategami Lioh to turn the tides. Even after forming Go-Buster King, with Nick joining Red Buster in the cockpit, the Go-Busters still find themselves at a disadvantage. However, Go-Buster King separates with Go-Buster Lioh impaling Messiah Reboot with the Go-Busters' antivirus which surges through the wound as Messiah is utterly destroyed with the three Go-Busters emerging from the raging inferno. The Go-Busters then celebrate Christmas at Daian orphanage, with Rika arriving and Ryuji learning the teacher was once a resident of the orphanage, Hiromu states that they have reason to fight and live for a better tomorrow. However, elsewhere, Enter manifests and wishes the Go-Busters a Merry Christmas while he is now closer to his evolution into a new Messiah."

        "Explaining how Hiromu is his back up, Enter reveals that he implanted Messiah Card 13 inside Red Buster. The card is revealed to have been retrieving data of the other Messiah Cards gathered and is programmed to recreate Enter upon the time of his destruction while copying Hiromu's data in the process. As a result, the only way he can be defeated is with Hiromu's death. As the others confirm Enter's words, Hiromu takes this revelation hard as it effects his training and now understanding why Enter has been easy on him. Putting up a front as Yoko tells him the others are trying to find a way to get the card out of him, Hiromu resolves that the only way to defeat Enter is to face him and escapes the Energy Management Center. Elsewhere, Enter creates a new more aggressive Escape by fusing a snake into her data make up. But seeing that restoring her original mindset impossible as her data is beyond corruption, Enter leaves to Escape to her devices as she proceeds to assimilate various animals into her being. The next day at the Kindai district, luring Enter with an attempted suicide, Hiromu transforms and assumes Powered Custom mode to fight him in battle to the death. But because of the Messiah Card in Hiromu gives him a bit of his host's data with each recreating, Enter can mimic Red Buster's fighting style as he intends to put his back up in a coma. Elsewhere, the other Go-Busters run into Escape as she assumes her monstrous Evolve Animal Unite Form to attack them. Though they manage to overpower her, Escape assimilate the surrounding matter to become Escape Zeta as Go-Buster King is formed to fight her. Motivated to put her out of her misery, the Go-Busters destroy Escape Zeta with Blue Buster giving Escape peace of mind as she is deleted for good. Arriving to the site of his fight with Enter, they find Red Buster making his move to destroy both himself and Enter in the flames of his Volcanic Attack unless the latter removes the Messiah Card from him. Impressed, Enter responds by intensifying the inferno with his own flame with Red Buster canceling his Powered Custom to save Nick. When the dust clears, Hiromu emerges from the cables Enter encased him in as Enter revives himself.

        "Arriving in a collapsing subspace, the Go-Busters check-in. All the Go-Busters arrived safely, and all Buddy Machines but Tategami Lioh are accounted for. When Dark Buster Enter attacks Hiromu and Yoko, Masato and Jay take off for the hangar, as Jay tells the others to meet him there. Enter appears to have the upper hand, until Ryuji arrives in GT-02 and uses the banana missiles to bury Enter in an avalanche. The Go-Busters make their way to the hangar, where Masato reveals his plan. Since the data from Masato's body that Enter has on Messiah Card 07 is backed up on Messiah Card 13 in Hiromu, they can digitize Hiromu and transmit the data on Card 13 to Masato's body. Like magnets, the body data will want to return to its natural body, dragging the card with it. However, Jay breaks down and explains that an infusion of that much data to Masato's unstable body will destroy him. Masato confirms this, but says the card would also be destroyed as well, removing Enter's backup and allowing for his destruction. The other Go-Busters don't want to sacrifice him, but he passionately pleads with them, as they don't have another plan that would work before Enter took over the real world. They agree, and Hiromu enters the transport chamber as Yoko, Ryuji, and the Buddyloids go to hold off Enter. Yoko and Usada and Ryuji and Gorisaki combine as Powered Custom, while Jay transforms into Stag Buster and Nick simply fights in his humanoid form. Masato's impassioned plead to Jay to help him protect the \u201cfascinating world\u201d inspires Jay to hold Enter off. The transport process completes, and as they expected, Card 13 traveled to Masato's body and was then destroyed with it, though his avatar can hold together a while longer. The destruction of Card 13 cancels Enter's Dark Buster mode, and he furiously returns to the Omega Megazord. Tategami Lioh arrives, and the Go-Busters throw all their combinations at the Megazord, but to no effect as Enter still has all the data on them. Hiromu realizes they need to use a tactic Enter has never seen, and directs Nick to transfer all their Enetron to the legs. This gives Go-Buster Ace Hiromu's ability of fast transport, which catches Enter off-guard, and lets Buster Hercules and Go-Buster King finish the Megazord off. Enter escapes to the ground, and he and the Go-Busters have their final battle. Enter uses his dark version of the Volcanick Attack, but the Go-Busters counter with the new Volcanick All Busters Attack, which overwhelms and destroys him. Masato's avatar dissolves, and the exhausted Go-Busters collapse, resigned to be destroyed as the subspace collapses around them. But Hiromu's father and Masato appear in the sky, urging the Go-Busters to press on, and instructing the Buddyloids to take them to Masato's hanger to escape. Enter's cocoons in the real world shut down, and the people inside return to normal, but the staff at the EMC are saddened as they see the subspace collapse with no word from the Go-Busters. But they are then relieved as a signal comes through from Hiromu, as the surviving Go-Busters are returning from subspace. A short time later, they celebrate Yoko's getting into high school again. We see that Ryuji has gone on to become an engineer like he dreamed, with Gorisaki as his assistant. Jay has designated himself the overseer of the forest, and wears the black Jenga block around his neck in memory of Masato. Nick and Hiromu stand on the same bridge they first drove across at the beginning of the series, and Nick asks Hiromu what's next. Hiromu says he doesn't know, and that he has 13 years of thinking to make up for. Nick says he'll stay with Hiromu wherever he goes, and the two drive off into the sunset.",

He has a computer wife named Karen, who is actually a \"W.I.F.E.\" (Wired Integrated Female Electroencephalograph). Karen usually gives Plankton ideas to steal the Krabby Patty formula, which he often censors out and takes them as his. Plankton and Karen's marital relationship is often shown as very dysfunctional.

As Kaito and the others head to their location, Freecell explains how the memento he received from Solitia was a puzzle he wanted to solve with Kite. Nonoha then proceeds to tell him the truth about what happened to Solitia. She also manages to replicate a puzzle Solitia made containing a secret answer showing Solitia's earnest feelings for Freecell, who then starts envisioning Nonoha as his own mother. Meanwhile, Kaito and the others are greeted by Hoist, who wants to create a successor that can surpass God. As Freecell appears to start the puzzle, he forces the Final Ring onto Kaito to try and make him a Phi Brain child, but Kaito manages to break it with his will. Freecell soon proceeds to take Kaito to the location of the Puzzle of God he has made.",

He goes on to explain his research on Jin's year spent with Raetsel, showing that even though he foughts against Fool's Puzzles, he also taught others the fun of puzzles. Wanting to prove her own case, Raetsel takes Kaito and Rook to a Fool's Puzzle that Jin wasn't able to solve, consisting of various elevators above a bottomless pit. Seeking an answer to Jin's riddle, Rook takes on the puzzle, in which he must navigate the elevators based on their assigned numbers or else be crushed. With encouragement from Kaito to listen to puzzle's voice, Rook manages to reach the goal. Rook states he was able to solve the puzzle thanks to a clue allegedly left behind by Jin, who apparently lied to Raetsel about not completing it to keep her safe. Rook then states his answer to Jin's riddles, that puzzles are both chains that link people together and mirrors that reflect the solver's emotions.",

Day 2: Early in the morning Mads second task was to gather his clothes and dump it all in the jacuzzi when everyone else were sleeping. The following day he should try to blame it on someone else. Day 2: The 3 housemates in the bunnie house received a task to peel carrots. The bunnie housemate who peeled the most carrots within 3 days won a place in the real Big Brother house. Day 2: Mads was told he could stay in the house when Big Brother revealed that the other housemates knew he was a secret agent - and that he was safe in the upcoming nomination. Day 3: Michella was told that she was a secret agent for the bunnie housemates. Day 5: Clifford peels most carrots and gets to stay in the Big Brother house. Day 7: The housemates had to wear Robin Hood costumes, take practice shots. If they had won (which they did not) they would have had 4 rabbits for lunch."
