They both become frightened by how much they have come to care about each other. Jake and Jo observe that the necklace Billy plans to give Alison for Christmas is more than a \"friendship\" present.

She later apologizes, and he gives her the necklace. They admit that they have become confused by their feelings. Jo and Jake try to overcome their unhappy memories of Christmas.

When Daichi finds out it's a tag team event and he's not going to go up against Tyson, he's totally enraged, but decides to beat Kai anyway. Meanwhile, the mysterious Jin is lurking around the dressing room listening in on our hero's conversations.

        "In Madrid for the Spanish leg of the World Championships, the hard-of-sleeping Lee has a nightmare that Ray kicks him off the team for his poor play. The day before their next match, White Tiger X encounters a pair of beyblading jugglers in Madrid's main square, who also happen to be trick bladers. When Lee criticizes their performance, he and Ray are challenged to an impromptu match. The jugglers beat them handily, which only exacerbates Lee's insecurity about his skills. Ray suspects that Lee's problem stems not only from a lack of sleep lately, but from a lack of communication between the two. Ray discusses the problem with Tyson, who suggests that Ray be more confrontational. Mr. Dickenson meanwhile, ponders whether to grant F Dynasty their request for a two-on-two match. Turns out it was Raul and Julia of F Dynasty who posed as the street jugglers in order to goad Lee and Ray. When the day of the match arrives, and White Tiger X faces F Dynasty, Lee and Ray discover the jugglers' true identities. Wanting payback for their earlier loss, Lee and Ray accept the two-on-two challenge and the match format is set. F Dynasty dominates the contest, causing Lee to go batty in fear of letting Ray down yet again. Coming loose at the seams, Lee's reckless blading becomes a serious concern. To save his fragile-minded teammate from further distress, Ray knocks out Lee's blade himself and accept his team's loss. Discussing the incident afterward, Lee acknowledges his mistake, and he and Ray vow to be more communicative in the future.",

Tyson is still skeptical, and his bad-mouthing of Boris draws the ire of a top BEGA prospect \u2013 a juggernaut named Crusher, whose Beyblade launcher is the biggest one the boys have ever seen. When grilled by Tyson about his motives for joining this professional league, Crusher admits he\u2019s doing it for the prospect of getting rich, but only so he can afford to pay his younger sister\u2019s hospital bills. A Beybattle ensues, and Crusher shows he\u2019s even more powerful than he looks. Tyson is nearly defeated, but he summons his will and narrowly defeats his jumbo-sized opponent. When Boris asks Tyson if he now believes he\u2019s sincere in his reasons for creating BEGA, Tyson still isn\u2019t sure. But Tyson does admit that if spirited and honorable Blader\u2019s like Crusher are in it, maybe there is some merit in the new league after all."

And in you and in your seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed. 15 And, behold, I am with you, and will keep you wherever you go, and will bring you back into this land; for I will not leave you, until I have done that of which I have spoken to you."

Nano plays a game of Hide and Seek with Sakamoto and the Professor but when neither of them can't find the Professor and decides to take a break, the Professor, scared that they won't find her, immediately comes out of her hiding place. Back at Mio's home, Mio loses her temper on Y\u016bko about how her friends aren't helpful in drawing her manga especially Y\u016bko, who instead of buying the papers she needs to draw her manga, bought drinks and made unfunny jokes. When Y\u016bko tries to explain something, Mio continues shouting at her until she realizes that Y\u016bko did indeed buy the papers much to her embarrassment."

Kenny and Hilary are on the look out for their mysterious captors when Tyson shows up with a new scheme to find Ozuma. Out of nowhere, Snakey shows up and challenges Tyson to a match. Little does Tyson know that Snakey is being used as bait so that Gideon can collect data on Dragoon. Tyson accepts the challenge but it looks like he might lose until Kai appears and offers some much-needed support. Tyson releases Dragoon and after an intense battle he knocks Snakey\u2019s Blade out of the stadium and wins the match. Unfortunately Gideon\u2019s henchmen, hiding in the bushes, record the whole event and send it back to Gideon\u2019s lair. Meanwhile Ozuma and Dunga watch all the action from afar and prepare for their own battles with Tyson and Dragoon!\u201d"

During their session, Max is lured away by Mariam, who initiates a battle with him in the woods. When Ray comes looking for Max, he ends up encountering Joseph. Together, the four combatants have a rare, two-on-two beybattle that\u2019s secretly being observed by the other Saint Shields, who are testing them for some unknown reason. The two-on-two match ends with Max and Ray losing decisively as a result of Mariam and Joseph\u2019s heightened team play."

        "Mr. Dickenson deciphers the words that are carved onto the mysterious rocks and reads the kids this warning; \u201cDare not disturb this stone, for here, the Bit Beasts are sealed.\u201d The kids realize that the Saint Shields are part of a clan which still uses this ancient language and they resolve to confront them, even if it means battling and losing their Beyblades in the bargain. Ozuma reveals the history of the Bit Beasts to the Bladebreakers, telling of them of their origin as benevolent spirits until evil men discovered how to control them and use them for their own malicious needs. Since that time, the clan of the Saint Shields has made it their mission to seal the Bit Beasts and save the world from destruction.

Queen uses it against Max, and nearly grinds Draciel into a pulp. But with Max using the new Draciel V2 Judy gave him, and having the will of the crowd and his teammates behind him, Max overcomes this attack, destroys Queen's Beyblade, and wins the first match of the best-of-two.

        "In the Semi-Final round of the World Beyblade Championships, Max & Tyson take on King & Queen. Doctor K tempts Queen into using a vicious new attack ring she's created called 'The Shredder'. Queen uses it against Max, and nearly grinds Draciel into a pulp. But with Max using the new Draciel V2 Judy gave him, and having the will of the crowd and his teammates behind him, Max overcomes this attack, destroys Queen's Beyblade, and wins the first match of the best-of-two. Next up, is King versus Tyson, who has an improved Beyblade of his own, thanks to Kenny's ingenuity. Angered by the failure of Doctor K's attack ring, King dissolves his partnership with the scientist and vows to combat Tyson without her assistance. The resulting match is an intense, high-powered battle that's not only fair, but completely up for grabs.

The match is tied and the Majestics grudgingly admit to themselves that the only way they will win the contest is to fight as a team, as the Bladebreakers do. Facing off against Tyson in the final match, will Robert be able to apply the fundamentals of teamwork? And will the Bladebreakers ever discover who sent them on their cross-Europe trip in the first place?"
