She admits that Jay has been the mastermind of the ship since the beginning, but keeps him and Ben close in a secret pact in order to win more booty. They mislead Nessa into believing that she is to be among the planned \"final four\". In the expedition, the Black Crew narrowly defeats the Red Crew, maintaining Christa's captaincy. Christa black spots Kendra and a surprised Nessa. At Pirate's Court, Nessa understates her athleticism by proclaiming to the crew that Kendra's weak swimming is more likely to cause a mission loss then her strengths could cause a win. She also openly accuses Ben, Jay, and Christa of a secret alliance which they deny. Despite this, the pirates unanimously vote her out.",
