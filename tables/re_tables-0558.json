She fears looking into the mirror at night. Nine years ago she lost custody of her daughter in the aftermath of her divorce. She wants to gain control of her anxiety so that she can regain custody of her daughter. Ultimately Karen was helped through therapy. Dr. Karen Pickett used CBT by exposing her to her fears. Dr. Pickett urged Karen to look underneath her bed at night. Karen visited an earthquake simulator. Russ was also helped through therapy. Dr. Rebecca Gladding was able to get Russ to gradually throw out items which he valued greatly. Dr. Gladding helped Russ set goals of clearing one room of clutter at a time. After several months, Russ made progress, although not enough to impress his friend. Russ has since joined a book club to make new friends."
