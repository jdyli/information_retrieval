Great-aunt Elroy and Candy make peace, and Candy realizes the folly of her superstition when Anthony laughs about it. When the family holds their annual fox hunt, Candy gets the honor to welcome the hunters. Once the hunt starts, Anthony and Candy break away and ride to a hilltop precious to Anthony.

        "Daughter of Thomas Boleyn, and sister of George and Mary Boleyn. Anne was sent to be a lady-in-waiting to Queen Katherine, as a pawn of her father's and her uncle's schemes to ruin Cardinal Wolsey. She attracted Henry VIII's attention at the masquerade where she, along with Henry's sister Margaret, played two of the Graces. By her father's orders, she continually put herself in Henry's way, till Henry was so enamoured of her that he vowed he would take her as his only mistress if she would give herself to him. Anne, remembering how her sister was thrown aside after Henry tired of her, refused him, saying that she was saving her virginity for her eventual husband, causing Henry, already at odds with Queen Katherine for failing to produce a living son, to consider annulment or divorce. She admits to her father that while she did not like the role of sacrificial lamb at first, she was growing to love Henry. At first the relationship was a secret, but more and more Henry honored her as his consort rather than Katherine. The delay of the annulment proceedings frustrated Henry, and Anne used this opportunity to blame Wolsey for the delay, leaving him when she felt that the proceedings will never come to fruition. She also gradually turned him in favor of Protestantism so that, as head of the church in his realm, he could finally divorce Katherine without referring to the Roman Church. The second season sees Anne reach the peak of her power. She is created as Marquess of Pembroke and is taken to France to meet the French King, Francis, as the future Queen and sleeps with Henry and thus conceives a child who she is confident will be a boy. Anne and Henry's hopes are dashed when she gives birth to a daughter, Elizabeth, which sets in motion the Act of Succession. She is more or less manipulated by her father to do everything to win Henry's love (which becomes evident after her miscarriage of her second child). She allows Henry to disinherit his daughter Mary but tries to establish ties with her conditional upon Mary accepting her as queen. Mary rebuffs this offer. Anne becomes desperate to conceive a son but miscarries and is accused of witchcraft and adultery. Henry removes Elizabeth from the line of succession, convinced she is not his daughter, and sentences Anne to execution by beheading. Anne re-appears in the final episode of Season 4 in the dream sequence alongside Elizabeth, proclaiming her innocence that the crimes she was killed for were of false witness and defends her cousin Katherine Howard.",

She allows Henry to disinherit his daughter Mary but tries to establish ties with her conditional upon Mary accepting her as queen. Mary rebuffs this offer. Anne becomes desperate to conceive a son but miscarries and is accused of witchcraft and adultery. Henry removes Elizabeth from the line of succession, convinced she is not his daughter, and sentences Anne to execution by beheading.

        "Daughter of Thomas Boleyn, and sister of George and Mary Boleyn. Anne was sent to be a lady-in-waiting to Queen Katherine, as a pawn of her father's and her uncle's schemes to ruin Cardinal Wolsey. She attracted Henry VIII's attention at the masquerade where she, along with Henry's sister Margaret, played two of the Graces. By her father's orders, she continually put herself in Henry's way, till Henry was so enamoured of her that he vowed he would take her as his only mistress if she would give herself to him. Anne, remembering how her sister was thrown aside after Henry tired of her, refused him, saying that she was saving her virginity for her eventual husband, causing Henry, already at odds with Queen Katherine for failing to produce a living son, to consider annulment or divorce. She admits to her father that while she did not like the role of sacrificial lamb at first, she was growing to love Henry. At first the relationship was a secret, but more and more Henry honored her as his consort rather than Katherine. The delay of the annulment proceedings frustrated Henry, and Anne used this opportunity to blame Wolsey for the delay, leaving him when she felt that the proceedings will never come to fruition. She also gradually turned him in favor of Protestantism so that, as head of the church in his realm, he could finally divorce Katherine without referring to the Roman Church. The second season sees Anne reach the peak of her power. She is created as Marquess of Pembroke and is taken to France to meet the French King, Francis, as the future Queen and sleeps with Henry and thus conceives a child who she is confident will be a boy. Anne and Henry's hopes are dashed when she gives birth to a daughter, Elizabeth, which sets in motion the Act of Succession. She is more or less manipulated by her father to do everything to win Henry's love (which becomes evident after her miscarriage of her second child). She allows Henry to disinherit his daughter Mary but tries to establish ties with her conditional upon Mary accepting her as queen. Mary rebuffs this offer.

Team Reborn and Team Verde meet at nearby park and decide to temporarily work together to defeat three Vindice who also appear at the same place. With their teamwork, they are able to rip off the Vindice's robes and are shocked to see the Vindice's true forms with a stone pacifier hanging from each of their necks."

They are both cornered and almost lose until Chrome arrives and supports Mukuro's illusions with her own, defeating two of the three Vindice. The last Vindice, Jack, is defeated by Tsuna not long afterwards. Bermuda appears, proposes an invitation for Reborn to join his team and takes him and Tsuna to the Vindice's Prison where they learn the truth behind the Representative Battle of the Rainbow and Checker Face. Bermuda reveals his intention to kill Checker Face, though this means it would also kill them and the current Arcobaleno. Reborn refuses the offer after Tsuna declares that he'll find another way to keep the Arcobaleno alive. Tsuna and Jager fight, but the former is quickly defeated. Bermuda decides to give Reborn some time to rethink his proposal and he lets them leave. Tsuna wonders what could he do to help the Arcobaleno, and gets an idea on how to prolong their lives. After some discussion with Talbot and after visiting the teams' bosses one by one, asking them to lend their strength, Tsuna's plan comes to fruition. The next day, the people whom Tsuna has visited gathers at Tsuna's house as Tsuna asks for them to join forces and fight together to defeat Bermuda and his team.",

While Patricia is set free the next morning, Candy has to stay locked in her contemplation room until the festival. When Candy accidentally stumbles against the attic's window that drops out of the roof, she steals out and escapes for the zoo. At Albert's, Candy finds Terry and Albert laughing about Terry's nickname for her, and she hands Yuli to Albert. After Albert is called back at work, Terry eventually invites Candy to visit the zoo with him and inquires after Anthony. When Candy speaks highly of Anthony and mentions his passion for roses, Terry makes fun of her beau and her feelings for him. Hurt, Candy defends Anthony and reveals the circumstances in which Anthony died. Terry realizes his wild horse ride caused Candy to relive her fear. Although he feels sorry for speaking as he did, Terry cannot utter an apology and runs off. Shocked that Terri would speak ill of the dead, Candy tells Albert she believes Terry is a bad person, but Albert refuses to mingle in their fights.

Candy seizes the opportunity when Mark's sheep wanders into the summer school garden to find its owner. Mark lives at the Grandchester summer house, but is not really Terry's brother.

Candy talks about having seen Eleanor Baker, but he tells her she imagined it. When he starts to shear the stubborn sheep though, he talks as if he wants to punish a mother who abandoned her son.",

Just as Candy and Terry start to put two and two together, Sister Gray arrives with a patrol and Eliza and her friend Louisa as witnesses. Sister Gray decides to remove Candy from the Academy, while Terry will be confined for a week. Candy is imprisoned in a tower that she cannot escape from and weeps profusely at the injustice of the whole situation."

And while they all reminisce about their childhoods, they are all occupied by the war too. Patricia will come to Chicago, because London's safety may not be for long anymore. Candy tells herself to live in the moment and lightens the mood. Eliza cannot bear that two orphans from Pony's Home will stay the night in the Ardley mansion. When Neil and Eliza's initial plan backfires, Eliza involves her mother Mrs. Leagan as representative for the Ardley family.

Both he and Archibald fear that Candy may never return to Chicago to be close to Terry in New York and it leads to an awkward silence between Candy and Alistear, before the train pulls out of the station. During the train ride, Candy imagines the most romantic reunion between her and Terry. But as is usual the case between two hearts full of expectations and dreams meeting again after a long time, Terry and Candy are both happy as well as apprehensive... that is after she finds Terry who wears a shawl to conceal his famous face. Terry is genuinely happy to see her: she has not changed a bit and he feels so at ease with her; he loves her. But the demands of Susanna's mother prey on his mind as well as Susanna's forlorn attitude on his last visit. Candy realizes something is wrong with Terry, but he cannot bring himself to reveal what happened to Susanna, not wishing to spoil the happy reunion.",

Meanwhile Dr. Leonard starts to watch Candy carefully when he sees her spending so much time to take care of Albert. In New York, Susanna has found out where Terry lives and visits him to inform him that there will be an audition for Romeo and Juliet, just as he was looking up information for Candy to stay and enjoy Broadway in New York with him during the holidays. Susanna hopes the pair of them will play the leads, but Terry gives her the cold shoulder each time she tries to get close to him. Terry sends Candy a letter of his plan to invite her to Broadway and his coming audition for Romeo. Dr. Leonard catches her reading in a tree and chastises her in his office about her being only a student and needing to pass the exam if she wishes to care for their special patient Albert. This motivates Candy to follow classes with attention and late hours of studying. She's even more motivated to pass her exam, when Albert mentions how the other nurses and doctors make him feel like a pariah. At the audition, Eleanor Baker slips in to watch her son, who has to audition his part with Karen Kreiss as Juliet, while - much to her dismay - Susanna must audition for Juliet with Cary Grant as Romeo.

In New York, Susanna has found out where Terry lives and visits him to inform him that there will be an audition for Romeo and Juliet, just as he was looking up information for Candy to stay and enjoy Broadway in New York with him during the holidays. Susanna hopes the pair of them will play the leads, but Terry gives her the cold shoulder each time she tries to get close to him. Terry sends Candy a letter of his plan to invite her to Broadway and his coming audition for Romeo. Dr. Leonard catches her reading in a tree and chastises her in his office about her being only a student and needing to pass the exam if she wishes to care for their special patient Albert. This motivates Candy to follow classes with attention and late hours of studying. She's even more motivated to pass her exam, when Albert mentions how the other nurses and doctors make him feel like a pariah. At the audition, Eleanor Baker slips in to watch her son, who has to audition his part with Karen Kreiss as Juliet, while - much to her dismay - Susanna must audition for Juliet with Cary Grant as Romeo. Both Terry and Candy realize now is not the time for daydreaming, but to prove themselves in their chosen career."

        "Candy soon learns upon arrival that her delivery trip is not going to be a quick in-and-out operation if Dr. Kreis and his daughter Karen have their way. Dr. Kreis introduces Candy to Karen, who is quite upset that Susanna landed the role for Juliet. Karen believes she is a far better actress and believes Susanna pulled some strings to get the part. As Candy plays the interested listener, she has done her job as confidante a bit too well. Karen decides to keep Candy in Florida. But to Candy's annoyance, Karen prays on her insecurities, claiming that Candy has already lost per definition from her rival Susanna, because actors who play Romeo and Juliet together often end up marrying each other. During the rehearsals for Romeo and Juliet, part of the lights come falling down and Susanna selflessly saves Terry at the cost of her leg that needs to be amputated in the operation room. The next day, Dr. Kreis finally gives his answer that Candy needs to return to Dr. Leonard and Karen will not hold her in Florida either anymore. Karen has already left for New York to replace Susanna. Candy is free to go."

Neither Candy, nor great-aunt Elroy leave their rooms, let alone the house. When great-aunt Elroy gives Neil her permission to take anything he likes out of Anthony's room, Candy tries to reason with great-aunt without much success, and is horrified when Eliza and the gardener of the Leagas, Mr. Whittman, are uprooting Anthony's roses. Candy's passionate argument that Anthony's spirit will return when the roses bloom again makes the servants pause to reflect on their actions. If Eliza wants Anthony's roses, then she can do it herself, just as Anthony grew them with his own two hands. While Candy wanders through the forest, searching for a way to live with her memories of Anthony and her sorrow, Annie comes to visit per her father's suggestion and meets her. Annie encourages Candy to recall Pony's Home. As Annie and Candy return to the house, Annie discovers the sole rose in bloom in the garden, a Sweet Candy. Candy transplants the Sweet Candy on Pony Hill while she visits Pony's Home for a holiday of the sorrowful heart.",

Candy takes seven-year-old Jimmy with her to talk with Mr. Cartwright in person. After escaping an intimidating cowpoke, Candy investigates the premises and notices a gardener who is making sure the trees will keep warm through the snowy winter. She asks him where she can find Mr. Cartwright. When he asks her why she wants to talk to him, she launches a defaming tirade about his greed and heartlessness, not knowing the gardener is Mr. Cartright. When the intimidating cowpoke appears on the scene again, Candy and Jimmy run to return to Pony's Home and find out the gardener's true identity. Candy fears the worst for Pony's Home. In a last attempt to soften Mr. Cartwright, Candy leads the orphans dressed like angels to his home. Each \"angel\" gifts the rough men a kiss for Christmas.

        "While surprised, Miss Pony and Sister Lane give their consent for Candy to become a caretaker and teacher with them. But when Candy returns from a field trip with the orphans, Candy notices a fancy car, thinking it must be Archibald and Alistear visiting before they leave for London. Instead it is Mr. George who has come to retrieve Candy, not to the estate, but London. Miss Pony and Sister Lane agree it would be the best thing: she must be educated first before being either a caretaker or teacher. Upset, Candy runs off with Jimmy in a rainstorm. Wet to the bone, Jimmy develops a high fever and despite her efforts Candy cannot help him. Luckily, the adults catch up, and while George takes the ailing Jimmy in his arms, Sister Lane slaps the panicking Candy. Candy realizes she is a playmate to the other orphans rather than a caretaker and she accepts the trip to London, even if Jimmy swears he hates her for not keeping her promise."

The captain orders his ship to the rescue, but Mr. Stafford, a rich businessmen, stands to lose a big contract and threatens to have Captain Wells fired for insubordination and sends a telegram to the ship's company. When they come upon the wreckage, they manage to save all fishermen. Once they set course again for England, Captain Wells packs his belongings in order to face the music for his heroism.

Meanwhile, Albert collapses at work and when he wakes again finds he has recovered all of his lost memories. The first memories that come to mind are those of sweet Candy, and how they share the same apartment. Though first annoyed at having to drive Eliza's friend around, Neil looks upon it as an opportunity to make Candy jealous when he sees her walking in town. But she thinks he knows of what his mother has done, and in her anger makes a dent into his car. And when Eliza tells him of her and his mother's success over Candy, he finally sees them for what they are. Dr. Martin and Albert come across Candy pondering in the park at the same time a lion has escaped the zoo and is prowling them. Albert saves the day and the lion by using his talent to make animals trust him and gets hired by the zoo over it. He takes her on a picnic and has her promise that they are friends, living together, and that she should share her troubles with him, but he fails to mention he knows his past again. Another plus is that Dr. Martin hires Candy as his nurse, though he pays for it by not having his whiskey at easy reach anymore. Neil seeks Candy out and tells her he has a job, while she is being totally honest when she says she hates him. Upset, he throws a magazine at her which tells of Terry's downfall as a star: Terry has abandoned his acting career. When next she leaves from work, a chauffeur comes to pick her up to give her a lift to a gentleman who wants to see her; that gentleman is Terry ...",

        "But it was a trap by Neil to lure Candy to an isolated, lakeside villa in an attempt to \"win\" her love. Candy repulses Neil's overtures, bellowing out her anger at his childhood persecution of her. Neil locks the villa doors and plans to hold her there until she tells him she loves him. But Candy plunges into the lake and swims away. On the way home, Albert who went looking for her in his new car meets her on the road. His gift, a new dress, is of much use now that she is wet through and through. When Albert lies about not knowing Neil, he realizes that their living arrangement is most awkward and cannot last after he declares himself healed.

        "While Candy is still asleep, Albert steals away early in the morning, leaving behind a letter expressing his gratitude for everything she has done for him. Dr. Martin reveals Albert visited him early to say goodbye and left in a car with men in suits. Candy searches fruitlessly for Albert. Meanwhile Neil stands up to his scheming mother and Eliza and insists he loves Candy with all his heart and that the two of them will run away to be together. When Candy sees a church that reminds her of Pony's Home she enters to pray for Albert and discovers Patricia praying for Alistear in France. Patricia shares a letter from him with Candy, in which he describes the loss of his best friend at the front and his newfound enlightenment that war is a cruel thing. Candy remembers the music box Alistear made for her the last day she saw him and left for New York. To soothe Patricia's heart Candy gives it to Patricia. And unbeknownst to them, while Patricia lets it play over and over, Alistear is involved in an aerial dogfight with the Germans. He has the upper hand, but when he thinks he recognizes his dead friend in the German he attempts to kill, Alistear stops firing and is shot himself. The moment that Alistear dies in his plane, the music box in Patricia's hands stops playing too, and they fear the worst. The Ardley family buries Alistear and is stricken by his loss. And while Candy remembers Alistear how she knew him in the past, from her first meeting him to saying goodbye, she hears the music box play again. Patricia had it fixed and takes it with her on the train to Florida. Together with her grandmother she will rejoin her parents there.",

        "Sitting alone in her now-empty apartment, Candy grapples for some kind of satisfactory perspective she imagines Albert would present if he were there to internalize the death of Alistear. She comes upon an advertisement in the newspaper about how the elusive Grandfather William is interested in coming above-ground, when Neil bursts in and tells her he wants to marry her. She begs him to leave her alone, but to no avail. Even when she reminds him that she cannot think well of him because of the lifelong pestering, he insists that one day Candy will change her mind. Mrs. Leagan refuses to consent to the idea of Neil marrying Candy, but Eliza realizes that the marriage would regain her power over her brother as well as make Candy unhappy. She appeals to her mother to make it a direct order from grandfather William when he presents himself to the family and world. After persuading her mother, they persuade great-aunt Elroy by stressing that Neil threatens to enlist for the war like Alistear if he cannot marry Candy and that it would be better for their families to have an Ardley in name married to a Leagan. A carriage comes to fetch Candy with the message that Grandfather William wishes to see her. But as soon as she arrives at the Ardley mansion, Neil is there to catch her and be photographed. The Leagans and great-aunt Elroy inform her that she is to marry Neil by Grandfather William's injunction and is to be promised immediately. Luckily, the maids inform her that Grandfather William is not present and give in to her plea to let her investigate. Candy goes to the Chicago bank which is owned by Grandfather William. But he is not there either, only George. He takes her to Lakewood and finally presented to her mysterious benefactor. When she is too apprehensive to talk, Grandfather William turns his chair to take a good look at her.",

She has an arranged marriage (through her and George's families), is sexually abused by George, who shows no affection for her at all. She tries to win his love but is frustrated by his affairs and disgusted when she learns of his relationship with Mark Smeaton. She avoids sharing in the fall of the Boleyns by giving evidence against her husband and agreeing to the allegation that he committed incest with his sister. Despite her unhappy marriage and the scandal of her inlaws, Jane is asked back to court by Queen Jane and is appointed her principal lady in waiting.

Shortly before Anne's execution, her marriage to Henry is annulled, making Elizabeth a bastard. She is removed from the line of succession and referred to as Lady Elizabeth. In the aftermath of Anne's execution, Henry is initially unwilling to have anything to do with Elizabeth, claiming not to believe that she is his child, but when Elizabeth's half-sister, Mary, and stepmother, Jane Seymour, arrange for her to be brought to court and presented to her father for Christmas 1536, she is welcomed. She attends the christening of her half-brother, Edward, and later goes to live at Hundson with Mary.

At this time, Henry refers to both daughters by the title of Princess but it is unclear whether or not they have been restored to the succession.

By the end Henry acknowledges, while conversing with the spirit of Anne Boleyn, that he has always been proud of his daughter and does recognise that she is very intelligent. He also reveals that he wishes that he could have shown her more affection but that her resemblance to her mother made him keep her at arms length.",

By the end Henry acknowledges, while conversing with the spirit of Anne Boleyn, that he has always been proud of his daughter and does recognise that she is very intelligent.

Reluctantly, and without losing face, Franny agrees. When Candy appears before Dr. Frank the next day, he explains the room situations. She will have to speak softly before stepping out and Dr. Frank wishes Candy good luck."

It soon turns out that her patient is William McGregor who hates the Ardleys. A dispute over the Ardleys follows, which causes chest pains in McGregor.

Candy's friends search everywhere on the boat in Southampton, but no Candy White Ardley has boarded under that name. Mr. George makes clear that Candy has not a cent to her name to the anxious Sister Gray. Candy had gotten a ride from an old sheep farmer, Arnold, part of the way to the port.
