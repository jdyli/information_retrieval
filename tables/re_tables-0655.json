With Harry's attempts to prove the pilot innocent bordering on obsession, the father of the deceased asks him to perform an independent autopsy, which reveals that at the time of his death, he was taking medication for anxiety, which was brought on by the fact he believed that the aircraft was not safe to operate.

Meanwhile, Leo and Nikki's suspicions are aroused during a post mortem on a child, Ellie Harris, who died during a high-risk operation. When the second body is identified as Jamie Featherstone, the boyfriend of nurse Claire Kizowski, both investigations lead the detectives to a surgeon, Alice Huston, who appears to have a high rate of fatality amongst her patients. Investigating the possibility that someone on Huston's team is responsible for Jamie's death, Nikki is viciously attacked when she goes to meet Claire in the hospital basement. As she struggles to remember who attacked her, Harry works hard to discover just what happened to Jamie on the night of his death, and looks into Huston's case files, only to discover that she is being sued by the parents of a deceased patient - Sam Reid. However, when Harry discovers that Reid's death was down to Huston's registrar, who is also discovered to be an imposter, he soon realises that he may have worked out who is responsible for Jamie's death.",

        "An accident involving a lorry and a funeral procession results in the bizarre discovery of two bodies inside a coffin - that of the deceased, Ethel Mortimer, and an unknown, young man who suffered from a coke addiction. Meanwhile, Leo and Nikki's suspicions are aroused during a post mortem on a child, Ellie Harris, who died during a high-risk operation. When the second body is identified as Jamie Featherstone, the boyfriend of nurse Claire Kizowski, both investigations lead the detectives to a surgeon, Alice Huston, who appears to have a high rate of fatality amongst her patients.

        "A horrific car crash poses troubling questions for Nikki when she discovers that one of the two victims was the recently released Anna Holland, an accomplice to a particularly brutal murder whom she helped escape a life sentence four years earlier, by providing evidence for the defence. As it appears she was stabbed before her death, the police attempt to discover who knew the location of the safe house she was staying in - and who had a strong enough grudge to want her dead. As the investigation progresses, Nikki re-interviews key witnesses from the original case, and begins to doubt her earlier conclusions. As she prepares to publicly concede that she could have been wrong about Anna's innocence, Leo urges her not to throw her career away while there is still uncertainty - however, her father puts a spanner in the works when he sells Nikki's story to the papers, in order to secure money to clear his debt. Meanwhile, Harry tries to identify two bodies found buried in the garden of a house, and allotment, owned by a retired a Spanish couple. However, he soon discovers that they are connected to his colleague's troubling case, which may or may not provide the ammunition to either clear or implicate Anna in murder.",

Meanwhile, Harry is assigned to an insurance case that takes a peculiar twist, when it is revealed that the victim may have died of CJD, contracted through a blood transfusion operation undertook in India.

        "Nikki and Jack investigate the death of two women, who have been tied up and tortured in a basement. The trail of evidence leads eventually to a research institute where Lucas Ballinger is employed. Meanwhile, Leo becomes involved in the case of a young woman imprisoned for the murder of her baby, as a result of a direct approach from the baby's father, who wants to avoid having his older son taken into care whilst not wishing to incriminate himself. When a third woman is killed in a similar manner to the first two, the team discover a link with both Hearns, an ex-soldier, and Ballinger, who goes on the run. The investigation is complicated by Jack's feelings for the investigating police officer, DI Reid, a former lover whom he suspects of having previously betrayed him by tampering with forensic evidence. Nikki, at first sympathetic towards Reid, changes her view when she is trapped in a building set on fire by Hearns to conceal the third murder and Reid fails to help her. Ballinger tracks down and kills Hearns, then goes after his boss at the research institute, Dr Fell, who is behind Hearns' activities and the release of anthrax spores to create demand for a vaccine manufactured by his company. Nikki and Jack see through Reid when she begins an affair with a senior officer, and track Ballinger to a park, where he reveals that he was blackmailed by Hearns into participating in the release of the spores because Hearns had kidnapped his wife, one of the murdered women. An impatient Reid brings in a police sniper to kill Ballinger, and is finally shamed by the failure to find any weapon among his personal effects.",

Concerned for the couple's young daughter, Nikki convinces Jack and Leo that this is in fact the latest victim of a psychopathic serial killer, and, when Jack discovers that the intransigent DI Kate Warren has falsified evidence under the influence of her father, a senior police officer, he joins in the search. After an investigation of the evidence relating to an earlier, similar murder, suspicion falls on Alan Lane, an ex-policeman who has already served a prison sentence for the murder of his own wife.

        "When Tom Hancock's son Peter dies of cancer, Tom seeks an explanation and turns to Leo to help him find the cause. At about the same time, the decomposing body of Colin Connor is discovered in an old nursing home, about to be converted into ecologically-friendly apartments while the adjoining farmland is to be used for affordable housing. Behind the scheme is Lord Embleton, a government minister who is attracted to Nikki after meeting her at a function. Embleton's father, Sir William, tries to discourage him from the scheme, and is in secret contact with a sinister government \"advisor\", David Loader. Leo is intrigued by the post-mortem discovery that both Colin and Peter had the extremely rare Fanconi's Syndrome, and begins to think that Tom Hancock's suspicions may be well-founded. Jack finds evidence to suggest that Colin was in the disused building with a companion, who left him to die after his arm became trapped in a conduit while trying to steal copper wire. Suspicion falls on Colin's employer, Brian Blackburn, and his son Derren, who appears to have undergone a personality change since his association with Colin. Leo and Jack visit the deserted farm to look for evidence of contamination but are taken into custody by soldiers who claim that the land is in use as an army firing range. On their return, Jack scrapes their shoes and finds evidence of groundwater contamination. Leo is contacted by the farm's former owner, George Ryder, who says he has information about the cause of the contamination, but when they attempt to meet at the old nursing home, Leo finds Ryder's dead body and sees Derren running away. In the ensuing police pursuit, Derren falls off a roof and is killed; the post-mortem reveals that he was suffering from similar symptoms to Colin and Peter. Jack suspects that Derren was not responsible for Ryder's death, and finds evidence that implicates David Loader. Meanwhile, after Leo's house is burgled, he is suspended for allegedly losing confidential files. Nikki tries to get help from Lord Embleton, with whom she is having an affair, but Embleton's father tries to stop him becoming involved with her. Leo seeks help from Tom Hancock, and they go to the farm again and discover the source of the radioactive contamination: a train which crashed in an underground tunnel in 1962, carrying a nuclear warhead. When Tom finds a video revealing that his son and several other local boys had been in the tunnel without realising the danger, he takes a parcel of radioactive dust and threatens Sir William, who shows no remorse for covering up the disaster. Lord Embleton and David Loader enter Embleton's private office, not knowing that Tom has booby-trapped it, and both are covered in a fatal dose of radioactive dust.",

Meanwhile, after Leo's house is burgled, he is suspended for allegedly losing confidential files. Nikki tries to get help from Lord Embleton, with whom she is having an affair, but Embleton's father tries to stop him becoming involved with her. Leo seeks help from Tom Hancock, and they go to the farm again and discover the source of the radioactive contamination: a train which crashed in an underground tunnel in 1962, carrying a nuclear warhead. When Tom finds a video revealing that his son and several other local boys had been in the tunnel without realising the danger, he takes a parcel of radioactive dust and threatens Sir William, who shows no remorse for covering up the disaster. Lord Embleton and David Loader enter Embleton's private office, not knowing that Tom has booby-trapped it, and both are covered in a fatal dose of radioactive dust.",
        "When Tom Hancock's son Peter dies of cancer, Tom seeks an explanation and turns to Leo to help him find the cause. At about the same time, the decomposing body of Colin Connor is discovered in an old nursing home, about to be converted into ecologically-friendly apartments while the adjoining farmland is to be used for affordable housing. Behind the scheme is Lord Embleton, a government minister who is attracted to Nikki after meeting her at a function. Embleton's father, Sir William, tries to discourage him from the scheme, and is in secret contact with a sinister government \"advisor\", David Loader. Leo is intrigued by the post-mortem discovery that both Colin and Peter had the extremely rare Fanconi's Syndrome, and begins to think that Tom Hancock's suspicions may be well-founded. Jack finds evidence to suggest that Colin was in the disused building with a companion, who left him to die after his arm became trapped in a conduit while trying to steal copper wire. Suspicion falls on Colin's employer, Brian Blackburn, and his son Derren, who appears to have undergone a personality change since his association with Colin. Leo and Jack visit the deserted farm to look for evidence of contamination but are taken into custody by soldiers who claim that the land is in use as an army firing range. On their return, Jack scrapes their shoes and finds evidence of groundwater contamination. Leo is contacted by the farm's former owner, George Ryder, who says he has information about the cause of the contamination, but when they attempt to meet at the old nursing home, Leo finds Ryder's dead body and sees Derren running away.

        "After human remains are found at an Afghan water project, the brother of missing soldier Dan Lambert begs Leo to go to Afghanistan to prepare the body for repatriation and discover whatever they can about how he died. Nikki and Jack go with him, and almost immediately encounter apparent hostility from private security guards working at the site. Their leader, Sean Nugent, is reluctant to allow contact with three Taliban prisoners, and appears to be losing control of his men when one of the prisoners is found hanged in their cell; Nikki suspects that one of the other guards is responsible, and discovers that one of the prisoners, \"Karim\", is an Englishman in disguise. Leo develops a relationship with Fawzia, the Afghan charity worker responsible for the water project, and is assaulted one night outside the compound. Evidence begins to point towards Lambert having been killed by friendly fire. Clarissa interviews Scott Lambert again, and discovers that Nugent was an NCO with the original military team of which Dan was a member; her e-mail is concealed from Leo by Nugent. While Jack is investigating decomposition rates in the local climatic conditions, he comes across further parts of Lambert's body. In the meantime, Leo and Nikki are accidentally locked in the cell with Karim and the other Taliban prisoner, and Karim appears to confess to having been involved in Lambert's killing. After Nugent takes the prisoners to be handed over to the local authorities, Jack realises that the body parts are not Lambert's at all, and that \"Karim\" is in fact Lambert himself. By the time he alerts the guards, the prisoners have murdered Nugent and escaped. At the opening of the new water project, Leo spots Karim/Lambert in disguise, and discovers that he is intending to carry out a suicide attack. As Leo walks him away from the site, the explosives are detonated and both are killed.",

        "When Mark James' decomposing body is found in an abandoned building, there is every indication that he was part of some occult ritual. An upside down cross was carved on his chest, his wrists were bound with ivy and he was strangled. All evidence points to his friend Sebastian Bird, a rich idler who allowed James to live in his house but who had also developed an expert knowledge of the occult before being sent down from Cambridge for having had an affair with a professor's wife. Sam's testy relationship with the police continues as she has difficulty establishing a forensic link in the case and publicly criticizes the well-liked Police Surgeon, Dr. Richard Owen, for attending the crime scene without the proper protective clothing. Sam also has to deal with her rebellious nephew Ricky, who is constantly fighting with his mother and announces that he has left home to move in with her. When another of Sebastian Bird's one-time friends is killed the police are ever more convinced of his guilt and grow increasingly frustrated at Sam's inability to provide them the evidence that they are sure is there. The solution lies in an old case and someone's desperate need for revenge.",

Although the coroner ruled a verdict of sudden death syndrome, Delaney is not convinced and asks Leo to investigate. Suspicion soon falls on the dead girl's father, who has lost the family fortune and his wife\u2013 but the pathologist runs into problems when the local detective sergeant gives him a less-than-warm welcome, making it clear she is suspicious of his motives.

        "Helen Mathews is found strangled on the street. In the course of the investigation, the police learn that she was having an affair with Alan Whyte, a flying instructor working for her husband Michael. From the evidence, it appears that she was about to leave her husband and move to Canada. The police uncover a similar case from several years earlier with a striking resemblance to this case and are convinced that the two must be connected. Friction again develops between Sam and the police when her forensic analysis demonstrates that the two cases have no connection whatsoever.

        "When 75-year-old Millicent Lockwood is found brutally beaten to death in a local park, the police immediately focus on a local who was seen arguing with her a short time earlier. The autopsy reveals little evidence but Sam once again refuses to make the evidence they have fit the suspect, which leads to an inevitable clash with the police. She also sees two youths, Kelvin Price and Ben Quayle, act out part of the murder. The police, however, are pursuing other lines of inquiry and do not have the time, nor the inclination, to pursue Sam's theories. She then sets off on her own investigation, convinced that Kelvin and Ben are the murderers. She is also concerned that one of the boys may do himself harm after a third boy, who was only peripherally involved, hangs himself. The police are concerned that her involvement may actually taint some of the evidence they have and an angry DCI Peter Ross informs her that he has filed a formal complaint with the Coroner and the Chief Constable over her conduct. This obviously affects their professional and personal relationship.",

        "The day after Professor Silverlake, a consultant neurologist at the Dartmouth London hospital, raised his voice at three patients for smoking and drinking on the premises, all three are found murdered in their hospital beds. Silverlake, apparently the last doctor to visit the ward, later goes berserk with a shotgun after he is accused of the killings, however, is subsequently killed himself by a police sniper. Leo and Harry believe they have a cut and dried case, however, when the ward's night nurse is also murdered, believe they could have a coverup on their hands. Meanwhile, Nikki is deeply upset at having to perform an autopsy on an eight-year-old girl who is suspected to have been raped and murdered by convicted criminal Jason Bodie, a man who Professor Silverlake once performed live-saving surgery on. Whilst Bodie is committed as unfit to plead, Silverlake's daughter Naomi asks Leo and Harry to help clear her father's name of murder. As Nikki's mental instability over the girls' death worsens, Harry and Leo are forced to get her psychiatric help. But as the true identity of the perpertrator of all of the murders is discovered, it becomes a race against time to save Nikki's life, and prove that Naomi is responsible.",

        "Nikki's archaeologist friend Patrick becomes excited when a woman's body, apparently a thousand years old, is unearthed on a Yorkshire moor. However, dental records show she is a more recent murder victim and Leo, who once worked in the area, believes she is Jodie Fisher, a teenage girl who went missing in 1985. Three other girls were murdered at the time, and the killer, Karl Bentley, was caught and jailed. Leo decides to visit Bentley in jail, however, realises that the wrong man may have been jailed after a copycat killing is committed just hours later. Leo travels to Sheffield, where he uncovers the identity of the fresh victim, Kelly Summers. He soon realises, however, that Bentley may have had an accomplice, and that his accomplice may still be at large. This is confirmed when investigating officer Sonia Hardwick finds a letter to Bentley from his boyfriend in the original case file, supposedly buried by the original investigating officer, ACC Maynard. Leo soon deduces that Bentley's male lover, Bill Fisher, may be responsible for all of the murders.",

        "When army soldier Lieutenant Lockfield takes his own life at the Hillsdon Army Base, his friends and colleagues believe the suicide was caused by the traumatic experience of watching his friend, and fellow officer, Danny Ferris, die in battle. However, evidence soon comes to light that just before his death, Lockfield had been arguing with Catz, Ferris' ex-girlfriend. And when the body of a young female is pulled from a nearby river, it turns out to be none other than Catz herself. When Nikki discovers that Catz was having an affair with Lieutenant Lockfield, she suspects foul play may have resulted in her death, and that there may be an ulterior motive that contributed to Lockfield's suicide. Meanwhile, Harry carries out the postmortem on Lockfield, and soon discovers he did not commit suicide, and was instead murdered, after the discovery of a bullet lodged in the front of his brain - fired after the fatal shot that killed him. When Nikki discovers Catz made a phone call to former soldier Dennis Croft, who was cashiered for drug peddling just before her death, she believes it could be the clue to uncovering the real identity of Catz' killer. And when the police catch Croft skulking at Catz' flat, they take him into custody, only for him to reveal that that there was a cover-up over Danny Ferris' death, and that Ferris was in fact shot by one of his own men during the battle. After discovering that Croft was on the army base the day that Lockfield was murdered, the police soon believe they have caught the killer of both victims. CCTV evidence, however, discovers that Catz' death was due to a bizarre accident.",

        "Nikki, Harry and Leo are called to the Dutch Embassy in the wake of a shooting, in which an unidentified gunman has shot dead three people - police constable Ryan Barlow, dutch ambassador Peter Van Buren's sister, Trudy, and a third victim, only identified as Van Buren's personal bodyguard. During the shooting, Van Buren's daughter, Klara, is also injured, and his eight-year-old grandson, and Klara's son, Jack, disappears without trace. With the revelation that Van Buren's son, Yacoub, also disappeared without trace fifteen years ago, and that his brother, Diedrick, was killed in a car accident three years ago in Nigeria, Nikki starts to believe that one lone assailant may be responsible for the 'curse' that has tainted the Van Buren family for the past several years. Klara manages to survive her injuries, alongside her boyfriend, and fellow police constable, Craig Whitehead, but her shock revelation that the gunman was in fact none other than her missing sibling, Yacoub, sends the police and the pathologists on a wild goose chase. However, the news coverage has a strange effect on Van Buren's au pair Mary Olivant, who is later found hanged from a tree on Hampstead Heath, having committed suicide. And when the case looking into Yacoub's disappearance is re-opened, Nikki discovers that the third victim may not be Van Buren's bodyguard, and the team come close to uncovering a dark family secret - until the Dutch Embassy throw them off the case, and another pathologist, James Sabiston, who trained with Leo and Harry at the Lyell centre, is called in to carry out the postmortems on the deceased police officer, Trudy Van Buren, and the questionable identity of the third victim. When it is discovered that Van Buren's brother Diedrick, who had supposedly died three years ago, is the third victim, the team open a whole can of worms, including the possibility that Van Buren was responsible for the death and disappearance of his son.",

And when the case looking into Yacoub's disappearance is re-opened, Nikki discovers that the third victim may not be Van Buren's bodyguard, and the team come close to uncovering a dark family secret - until the Dutch Embassy throw them off the case, and another pathologist, James Sabiston, who trained with Leo and Harry at the Lyell centre, is called in to carry out the postmortems on the deceased police officer, Trudy Van Buren, and the questionable identity of the third victim. When it is discovered that Van Buren's brother Diedrick, who had supposedly died three years ago, is the third victim, the team open a whole can of worms, including the possibility that Van Buren was responsible for the death and disappearance of his son.",
        "Nikki, Harry and Leo are called to the Dutch Embassy in the wake of a shooting, in which an unidentified gunman has shot dead three people - police constable Ryan Barlow, dutch ambassador Peter Van Buren's sister, Trudy, and a third victim, only identified as Van Buren's personal bodyguard. During the shooting, Van Buren's daughter, Klara, is also injured, and his eight-year-old grandson, and Klara's son, Jack, disappears without trace. With the revelation that Van Buren's son, Yacoub, also disappeared without trace fifteen years ago, and that his brother, Diedrick, was killed in a car accident three years ago in Nigeria, Nikki starts to believe that one lone assailant may be responsible for the 'curse' that has tainted the Van Buren family for the past several years.

Thinking they are now dealing with a hate crime, the police focus on Carl Martin, a known race-hater. What they have however is a case of someone seeking revenge for the atrocities committed long ago."

        "Stock banker Bridget Flannery is found dead at the bottom of her stairs. However, with the crime scene having been tampered by the family's dog, and a blundering WPC, Harry and Nikki struggle to decide whether her death was accidental - or if somebody repeatedly struck her over the face, causing her to fall. Suspicion quickly falls on the victim's husband, media personality Tom Flannery - and an old grudge between himself and the MET appears to be the deciding factor in whether or not to charge him with his wife's murder. In an attempt to prove Tom's innocence, his lawyer asks Nikki to perform a second post mortem - but the results are less than satisfactory for Harry, who's evidence appears to contradict Nikki's point for point. As the pair are unable to decide cause and motive of death, they find themselves battling it out in a courtroom. But when photos are leaked to the press regarding the death of Flannery's first wife, Nikki starts to doubt her own evidence - and believes that she may have interpreted the case from completely the wrong angle. Meanwhile, with Leo still recovering from his attack, Harry decides to use the situation to his advantage, and suspecting that the fate of Olga, may also lie in Flannery's hands, he persuades Leo to put him in touch with a professor in Prague, only to discover that Olga was also murdered - leaving him in no doubt that Flannery is their chief suspect.",

The post-mortem indicates suicide, but Leo realises he missed vital signs when he uncovers evidence that the girl had been shot in the head before being dragged to the roof and thrown off, leading the police to reopen the case. When DI Neill seems reluctant to pursue the possibility that Ruth may have been an informant for an undercover police officer, Phil Neson, Leo starts to wonder if Ruth's death is part of a cover-up. When a gun is found near Ruth's squat, investigations lead Neil to Alex Webb, an employee of a local car dealership.

        "Nikki returns to her childhood home in South Africa, after she is hired by a private security firm to investigate the cold case of the disappearance of five young men in the nineteen-eighties, known as the Kensington Five. However, upon excavating the crime scene, she discovers the remains of six bodies, and begins to wonder if the culprit has told all of the information that he knows. Meanwhile, Harry and Leo are also in Cape Town for a scientific conference, but are waylaid by respective requests to lend their expertise to the examination of a woman's body dragged out of a bay, and the effort to reverse the deportation of a Zimbabwean asylum seeker, Kudzai, who was tortured in her home country.

The autopsy reveals that both of them died of overdoses from the same batch of heroin and Sam begins to doubt that their deaths were accidental. When another small-time dealer is killed, the police think they have either vigilantes or a turf war on their hands. What they have is something far more complex that involves one of their own.",

The subsequent investigation suggests the pair died during the sectarian violence of the 1970s. However, a secret closer to home soon comes to light. Sam discovers that her estranged son, whom she had at 16, is still living in Ireland\u2013 and the investigation soon leads her to his doorstep. The investigation reveals evidence of RUC corruption, and Sam is soon startled when the evidence points to the involvement of a member of her own family.

They find themselves dealing with the case of several children living on the coast who have experienced unexplained breathing difficulties, leaving one boy, Peter, dead. While Harry believes that the case is simply nothing more than mass hysteria, Leo suspects something more sinister. Meanwhile, a man, Nick Garner, is found dead in his car with a stab wound to the chest. When a link between the stab victim and the ill children begins to emerge, Leo becomes determined to discover who is responsible before any more fatalities occur.

Realising they are dealing with a people-trafficking operation gone disastrously wrong, Leo, Harry and Nikki set out to discover if there are any survivors\u2013 or any other deaths\u2013 while also delving into the victims' past. The team soon manage to identify the four bodies, and discover two of them were a couple fleeing China because they wished to have a second child.

        "Sam assists the police in the investigation of a multi-vehicle collision that results in the death of eleven people. She is joined by two new colleagues: Dr. Leo Dalton, an experienced pathologist from Sheffield, and Dr. Harry Cunningham, a new trainee pathologist who has just graduated from university. As they try to determine the cause of the accident, they find a severed arm that does not belong to any of the victims. They also have to deal with DCI Carol Deacon, whose role in the investigation appears to be not quite crystal clear to them. The mystery of the severed arm is soon cleared up when the police discover a body floating in a local river with only one arm. Sam decides to conduct her own investigation with little help from the police, however, DCI Deacon soon reveals to Harry that two of the men in the accident were undercover policemen, and realising that Sam is being manipulated, asks her to stay away. The police refuse to inform them of all the details, and soon, Sam's interference has serious consequences. Harry continues to try and find a balance between detachment and compassion as one of the survivors of the crash seeks his assistance.",

As they try to determine the cause of the accident, they find a severed arm that does not belong to any of the victims. They also have to deal with DCI Carol Deacon, whose role in the investigation appears to be not quite crystal clear to them. The mystery of the severed arm is soon cleared up when the police discover a body floating in a local river with only one arm. Sam decides to conduct her own investigation with little help from the police, however, DCI Deacon soon reveals to Harry that two of the men in the accident were undercover policemen, and realising that Sam is being manipulated, asks her to stay away. The police refuse to inform them of all the details, and soon, Sam's interference has serious consequences. Harry continues to try and find a balance between detachment and compassion as one of the survivors of the crash seeks his assistance.",

Two older children survive the attack, but one is in a serious condition and the other in a coma. Sam soon discovers that Irons was a ruthless businessman who targeted his rivals' customers resulting in regular confrontations. When Harry and Leo perform the post mortems on the three bodies, they discover that Irons was stabbed, but his wife and daughter were shot. Sam is soon reunited with an old friend from Northern Ireland, Det. Supt. Tony Ashton, who becomes the senior investigative officer on the case. As the police continue their investigation into the deaths, they begin to believe that he may have been killed elsewhere, and then transported to his home. When one of the two surviving children is murdered, Ashton looks to a circle of friends and family for a possible motive. Meanwhile, Harry assists the police with the death of an old woman who is believed to have fallen down a staircase, however, his post-mortem reveals evidence that is not consistent with a fall.
