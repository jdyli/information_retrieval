Inspecting a chip removed from one of Halston's drone cars, Bonnie realizes her advisor Halston is one of the Masterminds related to several crimes that recently occurred, and is kidnapped by Sheridan's henchmen, Clifton and Turk. After Michael uses KITT to electrocute Clifton and Turk, they reveal where Halston is hiding Bonnie. When they go to that location with the Police, they find she is not there, nor is Halston. Michael then uses reverse psychology to get Clifton and Turk to believe a squirt gun he has is a pain enducer, and they reveal that Halston wanted maps of Chinese tunnels that once were in the area.

Elsewhere, Devon has a meeting with Elizabeth Knight, Wilton Knight's widow, who remains involved with funding the Foundation, although Devon distrusts her motives. Michael is shocked to learn of the existence of Wilton's criminal son, Garthe, upon whom his new face was based. Devon explains Garthe had been imprisoned with three consecutive life sentences in Africa, and was expected by Wilton and all to never be seen again. He's managed to escape and has settled in Las Vegas.

Garthe shows Michael just how unstoppable Goliath is when he lures Michael to a dry lake for a showdown. Goliath clobbers KITT in a collision that nearly destroys him.",

April repairs KITT and installs a powerful laser weapon which may give him an edge against Goliath. Elsewhere, Michael surprises Garthe when he shows up alive and well at the casino and embarrasses Garthe by beating him at a craps table (with KITT's help). In anger, Garthe chases Michael down in his Mercedes, but Michael lures him into a trap where Devon and April hold him hostage. Michael then poses as Garthe to fetch Rita from the casino, and intercept Goliath before General Kuna uses it to break into Red Bluff. In the meantime, Garthe manages to escape and rushes to stop Michael before he can plant a bomb on Goliath. Once Michael is discovered, he is taken prisoner by General Kuna and is forced to watch Goliath smash its way into Red Bluff. A squad of Kuna's soldiers then load the missiles into Goliath's trailer.

He claims to be hurt and Michael begins to drive him to a hospital, but a quick scan by KITT determines the boy is fine and he has a very expensive gold watch on his person. Although Tino denies it, he lifted the watch from a group of men and Michael takes him to the police. The police inform Michael the watch was stolen during a bank robbery and the men are suspects. The crooks aren't finished with Tino yet. Fearing the boy can identify them, they try to hunt him down.

        "Michael goes to Vista Beach to investigate a string of robberies; the most recent hit is an art gallery owned by Marietta Mattheson and her niece Cindy. He learns the crimes occur when a local car club meets for street racing. Michael later runs into a gruff police detective, Chief Craig, who dislikes outsiders, especially ones who drive \"suped-up\" cars. Michael's prime suspect is Ron Prescott, Cindy's boyfriend, who has a police record and mysteriously skips town after a jewelry store is hit. Craig has another confrontation with Michael when he shows up at the gallery looking for Ron and harasses Cindy for his whereabouts. Craig indicates Ron's car was spotted leaving the crime scene, but Cindy refuses to believe Ron had anything to do it. Michael eventually finds Ron who swears he's not the thief and fears he's being set up. He has Ron hideout aboard the Knight mobile unit and investigates further. He soon becomes suspicious of a song \"Crumblin' Down\" played by a local radio deejay, \"Handsome\" Anson, and realizes the song is broadcast just before each robbery while the cops are busy chasing after the racers. Believing the song is a signal for the real thief, he heads to the station to confront the deejay, but Chief Craig arrives, and Michael soon discovers the detective is planning a \"wealthy\" retirement with Ron as his scapegoat.",

        "After sponsoring a charity dirt bike race, the Foundation receives information that the deadly crash in last year's event was the result of murder. More specifically, the death of Danny Duvall, a champion endurance racer. At the track, Michael learns Duvall had enemies; namely Lee Carstairs, (a flamboyant, highly-promoted racer), and Wade Fontane, (a jealous hothead who wants Duvall's girlfriend Sabrina). Sabrina is also the sister of Kelly Travis, a fellow racer and Duvall's best friend. Kelly was injured in the crash and nearly paralyzed, but Michael is impressed that he still has the will to race. Michael keeps a close eye on Kelly especially after someone tries to sabotage his bike. Michael chases the saboteur who gets away on the dirt track where KITT cannot follow, but soon, April fits KITT with a new traction system that will help him ride the rough terrain. Meanwhile, Michael finds out the saboteur is Sabrina who fears for her brother's life and wanted to stop him from racing, but Kelly is determined to get win for Danny. As the race begins, Michael is at a loss for the killer's motive, but he soon learns Carstair's high-income promotional contracts expired and he needs a win to keep his sponsors interested. KITT gets a test of his new traction system when Michael enters the race to stop Carstair's from carrying out his deadly plan.",

The duo doesn't get far when they encounter Goliath blocking their path. Veering out of the way, KITT flies off a cliff but is saved by his new emergency parachute, however KITT is disabled in a rough landing. Garthe's thugs soon capture Michael and he's introduced to Garthe's dungeon; a rat infested cell just like the one Garthe was held captive inside of in Africa. KITT is held in a garage with his nemesis Goliath. Elsewhere, Devon, April and Bergstrom rig an explosive to escape their cell, but they are quickly captured again. Garthe reveals that Bergstrom will be \"sold\" to an interested government and smuggled out of the country via submarine which is waiting off the coast. Devon and April's fate will be to die along with Michael once Garthe self-destructs the mansion. Michael eventually escapes the dungeon by tricking the guards with an assembled recording of Adrianne's voice. He quickly fixes KITT and rushes to fetch Christina and has the impostor Bergstrom arrested. Once Christina is safe, Michael returns to the estate to rescue Devon and April before the whole place blows. He then races to rescue the real Bergstrom from Goliath's trailer and stop Garthe and Adrianne once and for all.",

Veering out of the way, KITT flies off a cliff but is saved by his new emergency parachute, however KITT is disabled in a rough landing. Garthe's thugs soon capture Michael and he's introduced to Garthe's dungeon; a rat infested cell just like the one Garthe was held captive inside of in Africa. KITT is held in a garage with his nemesis Goliath. Elsewhere, Devon, April and Bergstrom rig an explosive to escape their cell, but they are quickly captured again. Garthe reveals that Bergstrom will be \"sold\" to an interested government and smuggled out of the country via submarine which is waiting off the coast. Devon and April's fate will be to die along with Michael once Garthe self-destructs the mansion. Michael eventually escapes the dungeon by tricking the guards with an assembled recording of Adrianne's voice. He quickly fixes KITT and rushes to fetch Christina and has the impostor Bergstrom arrested. Once Christina is safe, Michael returns to the estate to rescue Devon and April before the whole place blows. He then races to rescue the real Bergstrom from Goliath's trailer and stop Garthe and Adrianne once and for all.",

        "Michael goes to Calexico on an investigation for Joanna St. John, whose ex-husband, attorney Arthur Abrams, has been murdered at the Mexican border. Abrams was investigating the smuggling of illegal aliens into the country. When Michael and Joanna check out the site, they find the operation was smuggling more than immigrants when pieces of pottery are found with flecks of gold. Heading back to Joanna's motel, the two find an intruder who makes an amazing acrobatic getaway. Michael learns the man is David Dalton, a federal investigator working secretly for the Justice Department. Dalton is after Eduardo O'Brian, an Irish-Mexican crime lord who Dalton believes is behind Abram's murder. Dalton is hard to catch, but once Michael finds him, he convinces him they are on the same side and should work together. Michael and KITT conduct the legwork of the investigation while Dalton stays close to Joanna who decides to infiltrate O'Brien's birthday party at a beach house estate owned by Elton Mathews. Mathews has been supplying the vehicles and equipment for a mysterious digging operation only known as \"Boca Culebra\" (a.k.a. Mouth of the Snake). As KITT creates a disturbance, Michael hitches a ride aboard a truck and finds statues with gold bricks inside. Dalton learns O'Brien is using the gold to purchase a cargo plane, but the reason still eludes him.",

        "Michael heads to Tucson to investigate the theft of construction equipment from Frank Sanderson, a struggling contractor who stands to lose everything if his projects aren't completed on schedule. Michael's first suspect is Frank's former business partner, Lloyd Newald, especially after Michael finds a freshly repainted bulldozer on his lot that is similar to one recently stolen from Frank's job site. Newald hotly denies being a thief, but Michael knows Newald's financial problems could be a motive. Needing more proof, Michael tracks down the stolen equipment in a remote quarry, but he and KITT come under attack. A bulldozer pushes KITT into a ravine and buries him under tons of dirt. Michael and KITT barely escape the pit and give chase to the men leaving the site, but KITT is damaged and cannot keep up.
