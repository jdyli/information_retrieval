        "Ben, Gwen, and Kevin go out into the wilderness for a camping trip. During a car race between Ben and Kevin, a strange pod falls from space. While trying to open the pod, Gwen cuts her hand on it. The pod then opens to reveal a beautiful, dark green-eyed, blonde girl. Gwen gives the girl some of her spare clothes and the girl reveals her name to be Eunice, though she doesn't remember anything else. As the camping trip continues Eunice is revealed to have a strange connection to nature and Ben begins to develop strong romantic feelings for Eunice. Sunder then arrives on Earth on a mission to find Eunice. While Ben tries to take Eunice to see the ravine, Sunder appears and Ben and Eunice are separated. Ben, Gwen, and Kevin find Eunice at the ravine where Sunder activates a button on her neck, which turns her into a cylinder-like device (presumably an Omnitrix core). Ben stops Sunder from escaping with Eunice and Kevin returns Eunice back to her human form. As Eunice interrogates Sunder about her past, Azmuth appears and tells them that Eunice is really one of his early prototypes of the Omnitrix, known as the Unitrix,(Uni as in one and Omni as in all.) and when Gwen cut her hand on the pod, the Unitrix absorbed her human DNA, creating Eunice, and that Sunder was freed from the Null Void by him to retrieve the Unitrix for him. Ben convinces Azmuth to not put Eunice into storage but to instead put her on Primus. Before leaving, Eunice gives Ben a blue-violet flower as a sign of her equally strong romantic feelings for him to remember her by.",

Gwen's mother, Natalie, tells them that it's Sunny, Gwen's naughty cousin. They try to leave the house, but Gwen's mom insists they take Sunny with them. The team takes Sunny to the mission but, they left her in Kevin's car. They go to fight the robots. Ben becomes Four Arms. Sunny gets bored in the car, and she follows them. She destroys the robots with ease. Sunny is very happy, but the team is looking at her strangely. Gwen tells her mom that Sunny is an Anodite, much to her surprise. Then, a big monster knocks on the door. It is Antonio, Sunny's lovestruck boyfriend. Gwen tries to stop Sunny from going with him, but fails. The team goes to defeat the robots, which have returned. During the fight, Sunny comes to have fun and she defeats some of the robots. When Gwen tells Sunny that her parents don't want her dating Antonio, Sunny sheds her human disguise and a fight ensues. Ben becomes Ultimate Humongousaur and defeats Antonio. Sunny proves to be much stronger and more powerful than Gwen, and she managed to immobilize Gwen with her long flowing tendrils of whitish-magenta hair. Gwen calls Grandma Verdona, who comes and takes Sunny and Antonio back to Anodyne so their parents can deal with them themselves.",

        "An old man named George watches TV. In fact, he is actually watching some Forever Knights live. The group of Forever Knights that he is watching tries to break an ancient seal. The Knights headed up by Sir Reginald knew that behind that seal was the secret of the First Forever Knight, and possibly a cache of alien tech. A squire named Winston tries to tell Sir Reginald that this is a bad idea, but they ignore him and continue to break the seal. A bright light suddenly shone from the cracks in the seal. Old Man George runs away from the TV and leaves his home. The team goes to the place that the Knights were and encounter another Forever Knights group led by Sir Cyrus (who claims that his group is much different from the Forever Knights led by Patrick, Urian and Driscoll). Gwen finds that a monster was sealed there. They find the monster which is a Limax-like medium size monster. The monster touches Gwen's head and Gwen enters its mind. A few minutes later, she goes in her mind again. Kevin in his metal form also has his head touched but it has no effect on him. At the end of the fight, the monster kidnaps Winston. Gwen learns that the monster is a Lucubra, a monster from another dimension. They find the Lucubra again, but they don't let Gwen join in the fight unless they need her (due to the mental after-effects the monster has on her). They go in, Ben becomes Armodrillo and the Lucubra attacks them. Just when Gwen is about to go in, Sir Cyrus with his group appears. They go in, Ben becomes NRG, and when Lucubra tried to attack his head the team discovers that metal is immune to the Lucubra's mind control. NRG opens a big hole and Gwen conjures a spell to take Lucubra back to its dimension. In the end, Old Man George goes to the door and discovers that the monster isn't in it..",

        "Driscoll, Urian, Enoch and Patrick are all sitting in the same room, eyeing each other with utmost loathing. Chaos erupts when Driscoll angrily berates that Urian is wasting his time by calling him in at dead of night, accompanied by the \"heretics\", until Old George arrives. He scolds them for separating the Forever Knights into different factions. Incensed, Driscoll warns George to \"choose his next words carefully\". He then orders his knights to attack Old George for his insults but are helpless against Old George's more technologically advanced Forever Knight bodyguards. Driscoll then attacks Old George himself but is defeated with very little effort by Old George. Then, Old George reveals his identity and Driscoll kneels before him, calling him \"Founder of Our Order, The Original Forever Knight\", followed by the other Forever Kings and their knights. Old George unites the Forever Knight factions into one and vows to rid the Earth of all aliens. Pierce, whose identity is hidden by an ID Mask, is romantically flirting with a girl, but a group of Forever Knights come and demand that he leave Earth. They break his ID Mask, scaring the girl away and then kill him when he refuses to leave Earth. Meanwhile, NRG, Gwen, and Kevin are fighting Trumbipulor, who has escaped the Null Void. Despite their efforts, he escapes as Argit arrives in a shuttlecraft. He explains that the Forever Knights are trying to make him and other aliens leave Earth, and he needs their help to convince them to let them stay. Despite their lack of trust in him, they decide to look into his story. Finding that a few hundred aliens have indeed \"left\", they go to a Forever Knight castle to investigate. However, they accidentally activate the castle's security alarm; releasing another Dragon Robot, stronger than before. Lodestar and Kevin easily destroy the dragon. The group head to an alien food market to investigate and talk to the butcher Mr. Baumann to find out why the aliens are leaving. Mr. Baumann tells them that he has no idea, so Ben, Gwen and Kevin leave. They sneak back in and it is then revealed that he has been hiding an alien family from the Forever Knights. Mr. Baumann tells the gang that the Forever Knights have been attacking aliens on Earth. The team decides to set a trap and wait for the Forever Knights to show up at the date that a supply ship for the alien food market is coming. Soon, the gang is watching over a bunch of aliens as the supply ship comes, but some of George's knights arrive and attack the team. Ben (as Upchuck), Gwen and Kevin try to fight them off, but the Forever Knights outnumber them and a Plasma Beam Tank drives in and easily defeats Ben, Gwen and Kevin. Ben, Gwen and Kevin free themselves from the handcuffs they have been placed in and get ready to fight the Forever knights again, but Ben decides to challenge Driscoll to a duel, going from Spidermonkey to Ultimate Spidermonkey. Though Driscoll is gaining the upper hand, thanks to his armour, Ultimate Spidermonkey beats him and threatens him to free the alien he has captured as prisoners and get rid of the knights. The Forever Knights free the aliens and leave. Driscoll reports his failure to George, but George reassures him that he will not be punished and that this will be the beginning of a far greater war, \"The battle of a hundred lifetimes\".",

        "After trashing a Plasma Beam Tank belonging to the Forever Knights, Ben decides he needs to be in three places at once: 1) go to Julie's tennis game, 2) He has to fight the Forever Knights with Kevin, and 3) see the Sumo Slammers 3D movie. Using Echo Echo, he divides himself into three copies and transforms back into human form, creating three of himself. However, each is one part of his personality: one is logical, one is sensitive, and one is immature and insensitive. The sensitive Ben goes with Kevin to the museum, the insensitive Ben stays to watch Julie's match, and the logical Ben goes to see Sumo Slammers.

Ben resolves to become Alien X to get Bellicus and Serena to cooperate. When this fails, Paradox arrives and changes Alien X back to Ben. After a brief argument, Paradox and Azmuth explain that the Forge of Creation is where all Celestialsapiens (Alien X's race) are born, and Aggregor hopes to absorb the powers and abilities of a newborn Celestialsapien and become omnipotent. Paradox takes them to the Forge of Creation, where an accident pulls Ben's ten-year-old self out of the timestream. After a few difficulties, past-Ben teams up with his future self to stop Aggregor. As they make their way through the Forge, they discover many Celestialsapiens in debate with themselves, and eventually a Celestialsapien egg.

Kevin easily defeats Aggregor before absorbing his stolen power and attempting to kill him, only to be met with opposition from Gwen and both Bens. Past-Ben manages to get through to Kevin, who spares Aggregor's life before flying away, claiming he will not be so merciful next time. Paradox arrives at that moment to take them home before the other Celestialsapiens wake up, since he is not supposed to be near them, and return past-Ben to his own time period. Paradox claims that past-Ben will dismiss the entire experience as a dream while present-day Ben resolves to stop Kevin.",

        "After Kevin absorbs the powers and abilities of Alan, Helen, Manny, Pierce, and Dr. Viktor, Ben and Gwen argue about the best way to deal with him. Ben decides to kill him, while Gwen argues that Kevin can still be saved. The argument escalates into a heated battle between the two first-cousins, which Ben wins as Way Big using an incredibly strong and powerful cosmic ray attack. He then starts looking for Kevin, attacking anyone who has ever had any criminal connections with him, including the Forever Knights and Vulkanus. Gwen, looking for an alternative, tracks down Darkstar. She convinces Darkstar to help Kevin, and in return, she gives him enough mana to retain his normal appearance for one year. Together with a newly matured Cooper, Darkstar devises a plan to save Kevin using a fragment of the Dominus Librium. He and Cooper build a machine in Los Soledad, using the left over pieces of both Aggregor's matter energy converting device, and Professor Paradox's time machine, to strengthen and amplify the piece's energy-draining abilities, thus restoring Kevin's sanity.Darkstar also devises a plan to have Kevin absorb a fraction of Gwen's magical and Anodite abilities so that he will hunt her for more. The first part of the plan is a success, but Cooper and Darkstar need more time to finish the machine, so Ben recruits his remaining allies, Grandpa Max, Julie, and Ship, to help hold him off. After a long standoff, Ben is able to use Ultimate Echo Echo to finally subdue Kevin and hook him into the completed machine. The machine restores an exhausted Kevin to normal. Suddenly, Darkstar uses the machine to drain the powers and abilities from Kevin into himself, glowing with almightly god-like power. Predicting this outcome in advance, Ben hits a kill switch on the machine that takes all the stolen powers from Darkstar, and gives them back to their rightful owners, in the process of returning Bivalvan, Galapagus, P'andor, Andreas, and Ra'ad to life. Ra'ad thanks them. Kevin and Gwen kiss. Then Kevin apologizes to Ben for his actions, and offers him a ride to Mr. Smoothie's to get a smoothie.",
