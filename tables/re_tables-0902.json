        "Damien leaves a piece of paper for Lloyd in her I.D. Ray decides to not hand Max over because if he does, his team has to go back to prison. So Erica and Shea hide the convict. This is when she tells Shea about Pete\u2019s plans. Lloyd decodes the message into a phone number. They call Damien and tells them that Lloyd has to follow the treasure hunt to save Ray\u2019s daughter. The first step is to visit the man who Julianne lost her virginity to. She tells them that it was Billy McBride (Gabe Begneaud). Outside his home, Shea stays behind with Max in the car. As Erica is getting out, he lifts her cellphone and sends Pete a text. They go into Billy\u2019s home and find the next clue. This takes them to Marisol Duchamp\u2019s home, Charlie\u2019s widowed wife. Erica takes her out of the home upon Lloyd request. He tells Ray where the next clue is. Ray is forced to dig into Charlie\u2019s urn. They get the next clue and Max tries to escape again. Erica grabs him and they continue to drag him to where ever they go. Once back at the office, Shea sneaks out and meets Pete outside. Pete thought he was meeting Erica. Shea beats Pete up and tells him that he is to confess to everything. If he mentions Erica, he will find out how far his reach is. When he walks back in, he hands Erica her phone back. Julianne continues to try to track Damien but is unable to. Lloyd decodes the clue and is forced to go to its location. He is brought face to face with the parents of the young girl he had killed by accident. Ray gets a letter from them with the next location. They arrive at a trash dump and find a bag waiting for them. When they open it they find a hankie inside. Damien calls them and tells them that it is to wipe the prints off the gun that Lloyd is to use to kill Max. At the office, Ray is losing it. Lloyd pulls him aside and tells him that this whole game is about driving him crazy. Damien wants Lloyd to break down and land up in a straitjacket. Lloyd agrees to kill Max. They receive the call from Damien telling them where to kill Max. Ray and Lloyd head out with Max as the NYPD show up. They tell the others that Pete confessed to doing everything himself. Lloyd gets to the location and points the gun at Max. Damien calls him and starts to taunt him. Ray tells Julianne that Damien is watching from one of the nearby buildings and there is only five. She starts setting off fire alarms one by one. When they hear it through the phone just as Damien is about to hang up, they know what building he is in. Erica and Shea get there and start the chase. Shea chases him up to the roof. Ray and Lloyd catch Damien up there. Ray gets the location of his daughter by hanging Damien off the roof: she's on the roof of the Kings building and Julianne rescues her alive and unharmed. As Shea is about to cuff Damien, he tells Ray that he still has a little bit of Charlie stuck in his fingernails. Ray, in anger, pushes him off the roof to his death. Ray takes off as U.S. Marshals Chief Director Richard Wendell shows up. Ray goes to his daughter to bring her home and returns Charlie's shield to his widow. Wendell brings the team back to the office where they turn over Max, claiming that his story about what they did to him was a drug-induced hallucination. Wendell pulls all three into the interrogation room at the same time. He tells them that they will all be released with time served if they just tell the truth about what happened on the roof. He just wants Ray.",

        "Damien leaves a piece of paper for Lloyd in her I.D. Ray decides to not hand Max over because if he does, his team has to go back to prison. So Erica and Shea hide the convict. This is when she tells Shea about Pete\u2019s plans. Lloyd decodes the message into a phone number. They call Damien and tells them that Lloyd has to follow the treasure hunt to save Ray\u2019s daughter. The first step is to visit the man who Julianne lost her virginity to. She tells them that it was Billy McBride (Gabe Begneaud). Outside his home, Shea stays behind with Max in the car. As Erica is getting out, he lifts her cellphone and sends Pete a text. They go into Billy\u2019s home and find the next clue. This takes them to Marisol Duchamp\u2019s home, Charlie\u2019s widowed wife. Erica takes her out of the home upon Lloyd request. He tells Ray where the next clue is. Ray is forced to dig into Charlie\u2019s urn. They get the next clue and Max tries to escape again. Erica grabs him and they continue to drag him to where ever they go. Once back at the office, Shea sneaks out and meets Pete outside. Pete thought he was meeting Erica. Shea beats Pete up and tells him that he is to confess to everything. If he mentions Erica, he will find out how far his reach is. When he walks back in, he hands Erica her phone back. Julianne continues to try to track Damien but is unable to. Lloyd decodes the clue and is forced to go to its location. He is brought face to face with the parents of the young girl he had killed by accident. Ray gets a letter from them with the next location. They arrive at a trash dump and find a bag waiting for them. When they open it they find a hankie inside. Damien calls them and tells them that it is to wipe the prints off the gun that Lloyd is to use to kill Max. At the office, Ray is losing it. Lloyd pulls him aside and tells him that this whole game is about driving him crazy. Damien wants Lloyd to break down and land up in a straitjacket. Lloyd agrees to kill Max. They receive the call from Damien telling them where to kill Max. Ray and Lloyd head out with Max as the NYPD show up. They tell the others that Pete confessed to doing everything himself. Lloyd gets to the location and points the gun at Max. Damien calls him and starts to taunt him. Ray tells Julianne that Damien is watching from one of the nearby buildings and there is only five. She starts setting off fire alarms one by one. When they hear it through the phone just as Damien is about to hang up, they know what building he is in. Erica and Shea get there and start the chase. Shea chases him up to the roof. Ray and Lloyd catch Damien up there. Ray gets the location of his daughter by hanging Damien off the roof: she's on the roof of the Kings building and Julianne rescues her alive and unharmed. As Shea is about to cuff Damien, he tells Ray that he still has a little bit of Charlie stuck in his fingernails. Ray, in anger, pushes him off the roof to his death. Ray takes off as U.S. Marshals Chief Director Richard Wendell shows up. Ray goes to his daughter to bring her home and returns Charlie's shield to his widow. Wendell brings the team back to the office where they turn over Max, claiming that his story about what they did to him was a drug-induced hallucination. Wendell pulls all three into the interrogation room at the same time. He tells them that they will all be released with time served if they just tell the truth about what happened on the roof. He just wants Ray.",

Data on inter-molecular hydrogen bonds, gap volume and gap index available in MPID are pre-computed and the interface area due to complex formation is calculated based on accessible surface area calculations.

The BLAST hits are evaluated with the DNAPLOT program, which allows immunoglobulin sequence alignment and comparison, RSS recognition and analysis of the V(D)J-rearrangements. As a result of the BLAST hit evaluation, the VBASE2 entries are classified into 3 different classes: class 1 holds sequences for which a genomic reference and a rearranged sequence is known. Class 2 contains sequences, which have not been found in a rearrangement, thus lacking evidence of functionality. Class 3 contains sequences which have been found in different V(D)J rearrangements but lack a genomic reference. All VBASE2 sequences are compared with the datasets from the VBASE-, IMGT- and KABAT-databases (latest published versions), and the respective references are provided in each VBASE2 sequence entry. The VBASE2 database can be accessed by either a text based query form or by a sequence alignment with the DNAPLOT program.
