How far would the protesters go to prevent the bypass being built? And do current events somehow relate to the death of Michael Wilson many years earlier?",
        "Barnaby and Jones are in Dunstan to investigate the deaths of a reclusive couple. As they try to establish whether Ron and Libby Wilson were murdered or died of natural causes, their attention is drawn to a dispute raging between a local builder and road protesters nearby. When another death occurs, the detectives learn that there are plenty of dark secrets and fierce hostilities in this apparently idyllic village. Will Jack Purdy's quick temper lead to violence? How far would the protesters go to prevent the bypass being built? And do current events somehow relate to the death of Michael Wilson many years earlier?"

        "Postman Dave Cutler is on his morning rounds when 1950's dance music is heard across the village of Goodman's Land. Later that morning Dave is discovered murdered. DCI Barnaby and Sergeant Troy arrive in the sinister village to discover that Dave was a flirtatious man who had many of the village's women over his shoulder. He had upset many husbands in the process. Did one of these angry husbands murder him? However, later that night a woman is murdered in shrubbery near the village. Barnaby realises that most of the people in the village have adulterous relationships and that anyone could have a motive. But something is lurking in the autumn trees ready to murder and frighten."
