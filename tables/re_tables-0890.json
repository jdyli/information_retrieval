This semi-automatic pistol design allows the interchangeable barrels/receiver either 9mm kurz or 7.65mm which probably creates some confusion as to caliber, some references state .32 acp (7.65mm). Letter from the Museum in Vienna states emphatically that the caliber of the assassination weapon was 9mm kurz."

It is revealed that because Mytho's heart shard of love had been soaked in Raven's blood, he will turn into a raven when all of his heart shards are returned. Rue and her father need Princess Tutu in order to complete the prince's heart and the Raven warns Rue that she cannot try to make Tutu disappear. Under the raven blood's influence, Mytho asks Pique out, seeking her pure heart as a sacrifice to the Raven. He demands that she love only him and hate all others. Pique and Mytho meet at night where he tries to take her heart, but Princess Tutu stops this by explaining to her that she did not truly love Mytho.

        "One whole year has passed after defeating Barodius and the Twelve Orders, Dan, Marucho and Shun have managed to rebuild Bakugan Interspace and expand it. The episode begins, with Dan battling two Subterra and Darkus brawlers in Interspace with Marucho and Shun observing the battle. Marucho's new Guardian Bakugan, Aquos Trister, complains about not being able to battle after leaving Gundalia to team up with him. Shun's new partner, Ventus Taylean, tries to tell Trister to be patient but the two end up squabbling. Meanwhile, Dan and Drago are about to finish off their opponents with Dragon Strength but Drago has a vision of a strange Bakugan that makes him miss. But after attacking them once again, he finishes them off with a few blows. After the battle, the Brawlers observe two rival teams battling, Team Anubias and Team Sellon. Ever since they appeared in Interspace, they have become among the top ranked battlers, just below Dan and Drago. Suddenly Team Anubias appears and starts trash talking about the Brawlers, almost to the point of battling each other. However their rivalry is interrupted by a sleazy dealer named Dylan who tries to get them to buy his stuff and cause both teams to leave. The Brawlers leave Interspace and reflect on the state of Bakugan Interspace. After Marucho turned over administrative duties to the system, Bakugan Interspace became nonrestrictive and allowed characters like Dylan to enter. That night, Dan has a dream about a strange, gold-armored masked man ensnaring him in darkness and demanding that he should give him what he wants. He then awakes in a startle and he and Drago discuss the visions they have been seeing. The next morning, Ben of Team Anubias challenges Dan to a battle. Marucho and Shun try to convince him not to fight and battling two days in a row is bad but Dan thinks that it will be no challenge and accepts. Meanwhile Anubias scolds Ben for challenging Dan to which he replies that he is tired of fighting weak battlers. Anubias then lends him two Bakugan to defeat Dan. They then begin the battle. Ben sends out Pyrus Bolcanon and Dan sends out Drago. Drago struggles against Bolcanon due to its stealthy maneuvers but Drago uses an ability that blows a hole in the field. They then continue the battle underground. Drago nearly defeats Bolcanon but then Ben throws out Darkus Horridian. Drago struggles fighting against the two when suddenly Dan and Drago begin to have visions again and Drago loses control of his powers. He then defeats Bolcanon and Horridian but begins to destroy the arena. Marucho and Shun then send out Trister and Taylean to stabilize the arena until Drago calms down. Dan then sees that the arena is almost completely destroyed and is shocked by the huge amount of tremendous power Drago has displayed. Dan and Drago then wonder what they just did. Meanwhile Team Sellon have been watching the battle, with Sellon herself showing an interest in Drago's tremendous power, going as far as stating a desire to obtain it.",

        "Sometime after Dan's battle with Ben from Team Anubias, Marucho and Shun talk to Dan about having Drago sit out for a while. Dan, however, disagrees and says he will get Drago's powers under control, but secretly, he's extremely nervous about the amount of power Drago unleashed and decides to go and train to get Drago's powers under control. Meanwhile, Marucho decides to have a battle to make up for Dan having to sit out, so he fights against Jack of Team Aubias. He and Trister struggle to win against Jack and his Guardian Bakugan, Aquos Krakenoid. Meanwhile, Dan and Drago found an abandoned arena to use as a training ground, but when Drago is training, a mysterious Mechtogan who calls himself Zenthon appears and wreaks havoc on the arena. Dan and Drago try to defeat it, but it blocks Drago's attacks and eventually teleports away. It then interferes with Marucho and Jack's battle and wipes out Krakenoid and Trister with its laser cannon. Anubias and Sellon then decide to battle Zenthon and send out Horridian and Spyron. The two of them struggle to fight it, not even managing to land a hit because of Zenthon's shield. Eventually, however Zenthon flies off and Anubias and Sellon part ways. Marucho and Shun later speculate that since Zenthon has the same destructive power as Drago they may be connected. Meanwhile, the masked man, whose named is officially revealed to be Mag Mel, is trying to break free of his prison but requires more energy from Dan and Drago to fulfill his goal Then one of his hooded servants informs him of the Mechtogan attack. He is astounded that Drago has that sort of power and tries to absorb more energy from Drago and he begins to break free.",

        "The episode starts at a cave in New Vestroia, with Wavern telling Dan and Drago that the mystery to the entity in their nightmares will be solved in the cave. Then, Dan and Drago enter the cave. In Bakugan Interspace, there is a Capture the Flag competition in the Dungeon arena. Marucho tries to convince Paige and Rafe to try to not battle as much in the competition, but they take that as an insult and they leave angrily. Soon, Shun comes and tells Marucho that the only way to stop the chaos is to battle. Elsewhere, Sellon is seen contacting Mag Mel and informing him about the Capture the Flag challenge and he thinks that the Chaos Energy produced will be massive and he will be able to break out of his prison. Before the competition, Team Anubias meet up. Anubias gives Bolcanon to Robin, Krakenoid to Jack and Horridian to Ben. Anubias then states that he will not be participating in the competition. At the beginning of the competition, a brawler enters but is quickly defeated by a large group of brawlers. Then, Shun arrives with Taylean and defeats them. Meanwhile, Rafe and Paige are doing well until Ben comes with Horridian. Rafe and Ben use their BakuNano and attack each other. Paige joins in but then a beam from Hyper Pulsor comes and attacks them. Jack and Robin arrive but Marucho jumps in with Tristar and disappear in a giant wave with Paige and Rafe. Meanwhile, Dylan begins to wonder who will win since the participants are strong and even in terms of strength. Then, Shun arrives in another location and is attacked by Soon and Chris. They begin to insult Shun (Chris calls him an \"emo twerp\") and they use their Bakugan and BakuNano to battle Shun. Down in the sewers, Rafe and Paige complain that they didn't need Marucho's help. He tries to explain them that pure strength will not always lead to success. The two disagree but then they are ambushed by Jack. They begin to run but Marucho faints. Tristar explains that Marucho tried to plan the safest route with the least battles for 2 days and that tired him out, much to Rafe and Paige surprise, who underestimate Marucho's skills. Then, when they get closer to the flag, Ben and Robin are there. Jack then comes from behind and they all attack Tristar at once. However, Marucho uses an ability which acts as if Tristar wasn't there which leads the attacks to each other and Team Anubias loses. Also, Shun wins his battle against Soon and Chris. Marucho arrives at the temple, where the flag is at the top. There, Marucho sees Sellon who uses her BakuNano. Using her BakuNano, she manages to defeat Tristar but only before she finds out it was a distraction. Rafe with Wolfurio and Paige with Boulderon come out. As Boulderon runs up the temple, Sellon unleashes her Mechtogan, Braxion. Rafe succeeds in stalling for time as Paige gets the flag and the win goes to the Battle Brawlers. Then Marucho reveals his plan: He knew Shun would attract many Brawlers so there would be less people to brawl. Also, going through the sewers would reduce the amount of brawlers too and distracting Sellon was useful as the main objective was only to get the flag. After, Rafe goes on his knees and apologizes for underestimating him and being rude to the Brawlers and wants Marucho to give him another chance to be his student.

        "The episode starts at a cave in New Vestroia, with Wavern telling Dan and Drago that the mystery to the entity in their nightmares will be solved in the cave. Then, Dan and Drago enter the cave. In Bakugan Interspace, there is a Capture the Flag competition in the Dungeon arena. Marucho tries to convince Paige and Rafe to try to not battle as much in the competition, but they take that as an insult and they leave angrily. Soon, Shun comes and tells Marucho that the only way to stop the chaos is to battle. Elsewhere, Sellon is seen contacting Mag Mel and informing him about the Capture the Flag challenge and he thinks that the Chaos Energy produced will be massive and he will be able to break out of his prison. Before the competition, Team Anubias meet up. Anubias gives Bolcanon to Robin, Krakenoid to Jack and Horridian to Ben. Anubias then states that he will not be participating in the competition. At the beginning of the competition, a brawler enters but is quickly defeated by a large group of brawlers. Then, Shun arrives with Taylean and defeats them. Meanwhile, Rafe and Paige are doing well until Ben comes with Horridian. Rafe and Ben use their BakuNano and attack each other. Paige joins in but then a beam from Hyper Pulsor comes and attacks them. Jack and Robin arrive but Marucho jumps in with Tristar and disappear in a giant wave with Paige and Rafe. Meanwhile, Dylan begins to wonder who will win since the participants are strong and even in terms of strength. Then, Shun arrives in another location and is attacked by Soon and Chris. They begin to insult Shun (Chris calls him an \"emo twerp\") and they use their Bakugan and BakuNano to battle Shun. Down in the sewers, Rafe and Paige complain that they didn't need Marucho's help. He tries to explain them that pure strength will not always lead to success. The two disagree but then they are ambushed by Jack. They begin to run but Marucho faints. Tristar explains that Marucho tried to plan the safest route with the least battles for 2 days and that tired him out, much to Rafe and Paige surprise, who underestimate Marucho's skills. Then, when they get closer to the flag, Ben and Robin are there. Jack then comes from behind and they all attack Tristar at once. However, Marucho uses an ability which acts as if Tristar wasn't there which leads the attacks to each other and Team Anubias loses. Also, Shun wins his battle against Soon and Chris. Marucho arrives at the temple, where the flag is at the top. There, Marucho sees Sellon who uses her BakuNano. Using her BakuNano, she manages to defeat Tristar but only before she finds out it was a distraction. Rafe with Wolfurio and Paige with Boulderon come out. As Boulderon runs up the temple, Sellon unleashes her Mechtogan, Braxion. Rafe succeeds in stalling for time as Paige gets the flag and the win goes to the Battle Brawlers. Then Marucho reveals his plan: He knew Shun would attract many Brawlers so there would be less people to brawl. Also, going through the sewers would reduce the amount of brawlers too and distracting Sellon was useful as the main objective was only to get the flag. After, Rafe goes on his knees and apologizes for underestimating him and being rude to the Brawlers and wants Marucho to give him another chance to be his student. Then he convinces Paige to do the same and she unwillingly agrees and the 3 brawlers unite. Shun watches them, and comments that Marucho's plan was right all the time.

        "In Bakugan Interspace, Rafe and Paige win a battle, and the rank for the Battle Brawlers is going back up. With their new ranking, they will face of with Team Anubias in a 2 vs 2 match. Marucho vows to defeat them to get rid of the violence which leads to flashbacks of Bakugan using BakuNano. Meanwhile, on New Vestroia, Dan and Drago are training and they both think that they are in sync. Drago says that he wants to try a round with Zenthon. Drago then tries to summon Zenthon, however, during the process, Dan sees a violent vision of Razenoid commanding a whole bunch of Chaos Bakugan to attack Bakugan Interspace. Then, Razenoid summons a portal which leads to Bayview and attacks with a powerful attack. Dan is then about to faint but Drago catches him just on time. Afterwards, Sellon suddenly arrives. The matchups for the battles against the Battle Brawlers and Team Anubias are Marucho and Shun vs Anubias and Robin and Rafe and Paige vs Jack and Ben. They only show the battle between Marucho and Shun vs Anubias and Robin. Anubias uses Horridian while Robin uses Bolcanon. While in New Vestroia, Sellon reveals she is working for Mag Mel but she doesn't reveal her identity. She also says that the guy from before, Anubias, was also a servant but does not reveal his identity either and Dan was shocked. Sellon then commences the battle, summoning one Haos, one Ventus and one Subterra Iron Dragonoid while Dan uses Titanium Dragonoid. They are all quickly defeated by Titanium Dragonoid's Dragon Force Striker and Sellon said that was incredible. Then, Sellon summons six different attributed Flash Ingrams which all have BakuNano Shoxrox. Later, when Dan says that the only way to defeat all the six Flash Ingrams is to use Dragon Force Striker, Sellon's Haos Flash Ingram nullifies all Drago's abilities so Dan says if they can't use abilities, they have to summon Zenthon. They then focus to try to summon Zenthon and they are successful.

Zenthon then speaks and thanks Dan and Drago for creating him and letting him do his job. Sellon then gets angry and summons three Mechtogan: Deezall, Rockfist and Miserak. Meanwhile, The battle begins in Bakugan Interspace as Anubias uses Horridian's BakuNano, Aeroblaze and Robin uses Bolcanon's BakuNano, Hyper Pulsor. During the battle between Dan and Sellon, Deezal, Rockfist and Miserak attack Zenthon brutally. Mag Mel is then seen getting massive amounts of Chaos Energy. Later when Miserak, Deezal and Rockfist activate their lasers, Dan is thrown back and sees a vision of Shun and Marucho vs Anubias and Robin. Zenthon then get attacked by Rockfist and Deezal when Zenthon is down. When Zenthon is down, Drago says that they're going to pay for that but Dan says to Drago, we have to stay in sync. They then convince Zenthon to get up and they then become all synchronized with each other. The bond between Dan, Titanium Dragonoid and Zenthon is used to summon a Mechtogan Titan called Zenthon Titan. Zenthon Titan then defeats Miserak, Deezal and Rockfist with ease and then Sellon tells Dan and Drago that they can keep their Gate and Key. Sellon also mentions that the end of the world is still coming and Dan and Drago ask whats she's talking about but she teleports back to Earth and reports back to master Mag Mel. During the other battle between Shun and Marucho vs Anubias and Robin, Shun and Taylean defeat Bolcanon with Horridian remaining. However, Mag Mel nearly has enough energy to break free and a scene of Mag Mel with Razenoid and Razen Titan is shown.

        "In the ensuing chaos in Bakugan Interspace, the Brawlers wonder what to do. Rafe makes a note that it is only the Chaos Bakugan that are on a rampage. The Brawlers then summon their Bakugan to save Bakugan Interspace. Meanwhile, Anubias says to all the other members of Team Anubias, \"We can't be the champions of this place if its destroyed\" so Anubias has given Bolcanon to Ben and Krakenoid to Robin. Then they leave alongside Jack but Anubias stops Noah and gives him Horridian. Noah seems happy that Anubias gave Horridian to him with Anubias seeming concerned about his \"student\". Once they leave, Sellon mocks Anubias for his \"concern\" for Noah. He tells her to get lost. She reminds Anubias to focus with the task but Anubias mocks her for her failure against Dan and she then stops. As more and more Chaos Bakugan arrive, Marucho thinks of an idea and he decides to move all of them to Section B and delete the whole area, despite the fact that it will create huge damage in the system. Marucho then sends out an emergency evacuation but just before that Rafe gives Marucho Crosstriker for Tristar and gives Shun Hammermor for Taylean for the battle against the Chaos Bakugan. Then they, alongside Team Anubias, continue to try to move the Chaos Bakugan to Section B of Bakugan Interspace. Meanwhile, in some type of room, somebody receives a SOS message on his computer, which was sent by Marucho and a mysterious Bakugan is seen in the background. Back in Bakugan Interspace, the Brawlers keep bringing the Chaos Bakugan to Section B of Bakugan Interspace. They then have finally successfully led all the remaining Chaos Bakugan to Section B. Marucho then plans to fire up the erase sequence but Taylean and Shun notices that Team Anubias are still there and he tells Marucho and the others. Rafe then tells Marucho to not do it because it will delete them too and he doesn't. He then alerts them and they all run out of Area B but Noah is frozen in fear. Team Anubias just stays there with Noah. While Noah is frozen in fear, Mag Mel and Razenoid gain more energy to be free. Mag Mel then says, \"That's right little boy, tremble with fear because fear feeds me as well as Chaos Energy.\" While on New Vestroia, Dan and Drago feel a power surge and that it is Bakugan Interspace calling for help so they decide to go back to Bakugan Interspace to help out their friends despite the risks. Just as things looked very bad, a streak of lightning and a Dimension Portal appears out of nowhere. While the lightning appears Rafe and Paige had no idea what it was, Shun thought it was more Chaos Bakugan and Marucho thought that it was help. Marucho is right and someone appears in the Dimension Portal. It happens to be an old friend of the brawlers from Vestal and it is none other than Spectra Phantom. Paige and Rafe wonder who he was, while Marucho reveals that he sent a SOS message to all of the Brawlers' allies which Spectra was the first one to receive. Spectra then says that the Chaos bakugan are a disgusting sight and then he says \"Let's clean house\" by Spectra sending out his new Guardian Bakugan called Darkus Infinity Helios. Also the Brawlers' were surprised that Helios had an attribute change. Spectra explains that Helios' next evolution required an attribute change. Then, Spectra and Helios decimate a massive amount of Chaos Bakugan but however, he gets hit by some Subterra Iron Dragonoids. In the smoke, Helios took no damage from the attack because Spectra activated Infinity Helios's new Farbras Ability, (FARBRAS Infinity) and after that Helios beats all of them.

Marucho is right and someone appears in the Dimension Portal. It happens to be an old friend of the brawlers from Vestal and it is none other than Spectra Phantom. Paige and Rafe wonder who he was, while Marucho reveals that he sent a SOS message to all of the Brawlers' allies which Spectra was the first one to receive. Spectra then says that the Chaos bakugan are a disgusting sight and then he says \"Let's clean house\" by Spectra sending out his new Guardian Bakugan called Darkus Infinity Helios. Also the Brawlers' were surprised that Helios had an attribute change. Spectra explains that Helios' next evolution required an attribute change. Then, Spectra and Helios decimate a massive amount of Chaos Bakugan but however, he gets hit by some Subterra Iron Dragonoids. In the smoke, Helios took no damage from the attack because Spectra activated Infinity Helios's new Farbras Ability, (FARBRAS Infinity) and after that Helios beats all of them. Shun and Marucho are impressed, Rafe and Pagie are amazed, Ben, Jack, Robin and Noah are shocked (the last even stating that Helios is \"awesome\". Sellon is shown to be fascinated by Helios's power but not to the point of desire. However Anubias is angry. Then with a snap of his finger, Horridian, Bolcanon and Krakenoid jump out from Team Anubias who are in shock and start attacking Infinity Helios. The Brawlers successfully take them down with their brand new BakuNanos that Rafe gave them but Team Sellon's Bakugan come out of nowhere, alongside another bunch of Chaos Bakugan. Then Anubias senses Dan's arrival as he and Drago, arrive back to assist Spectra and the rest of the Brawlers as the chaos continues.",
        "In the ensuing chaos in Bakugan Interspace, the Brawlers wonder what to do. Rafe makes a note that it is only the Chaos Bakugan that are on a rampage. The Brawlers then summon their Bakugan to save Bakugan Interspace. Meanwhile, Anubias says to all the other members of Team Anubias, \"We can't be the champions of this place if its destroyed\" so Anubias has given Bolcanon to Ben and Krakenoid to Robin. Then they leave alongside Jack but Anubias stops Noah and gives him Horridian. Noah seems happy that Anubias gave Horridian to him with Anubias seeming concerned about his \"student\". Once they leave, Sellon mocks Anubias for his \"concern\" for Noah. He tells her to get lost. She reminds Anubias to focus with the task but Anubias mocks her for her failure against Dan and she then stops. As more and more Chaos Bakugan arrive, Marucho thinks of an idea and he decides to move all of them to Section B and delete the whole area, despite the fact that it will create huge damage in the system. Marucho then sends out an emergency evacuation but just before that Rafe gives Marucho Crosstriker for Tristar and gives Shun Hammermor for Taylean for the battle against the Chaos Bakugan. Then they, alongside Team Anubias, continue to try to move the Chaos Bakugan to Section B of Bakugan Interspace. Meanwhile, in some type of room, somebody receives a SOS message on his computer, which was sent by Marucho and a mysterious Bakugan is seen in the background. Back in Bakugan Interspace, the Brawlers keep bringing the Chaos Bakugan to Section B of Bakugan Interspace. They then have finally successfully led all the remaining Chaos Bakugan to Section B. Marucho then plans to fire up the erase sequence but Taylean and Shun notices that Team Anubias are still there and he tells Marucho and the others. Rafe then tells Marucho to not do it because it will delete them too and he doesn't. He then alerts them and they all run out of Area B but Noah is frozen in fear. Team Anubias just stays there with Noah. While Noah is frozen in fear, Mag Mel and Razenoid gain more energy to be free. Mag Mel then says, \"That's right little boy, tremble with fear because fear feeds me as well as Chaos Energy.\" While on New Vestroia, Dan and Drago feel a power surge and that it is Bakugan Interspace calling for help so they decide to go back to Bakugan Interspace to help out their friends despite the risks. Just as things looked very bad, a streak of lightning and a Dimension Portal appears out of nowhere. While the lightning appears Rafe and Paige had no idea what it was, Shun thought it was more Chaos Bakugan and Marucho thought that it was help.

        "Dan finally returns to Bakugan Interspace to help the Battle Brawlers in their battle against the Chaos Bakugan with his friends and Drago battles Anubias's Horridian, Bolcanon, Krakenoid, Sellon's Krowl, Spyron and Vertexx, while he is able to weaken them in the progress. While Drago is battling, Spectra Phantom and Infinity Helios were impressed of Drago's new power. Also, Rafe and Paige were scared about how much power that Drago had. Later, when Dan says to Drago that he should finish it, Drago summons Mechtogan Zenthon but Marucho and Shun were worried that Zenthon might destroy the place and also the Brawlers too. Zenthon and Drago start defeating a whole bunch of Chaos Bakugan but then, Dan suddenly has a vision of Mag Mel which causes Dan and Drago to go out of sync and they are unable to control Zenthon and he starts attacking Bakugan Interspace. Zenthon also defeats Marucho's Infinity Trister, Rafe's Wolfurio, Paige's Boulderon, Spectra's Infinity Helios and Shun's Taylean in one blow and they all turn back into their ball form. Later after that Zenthon disappears and Anubias summons BakuNano Aeroblaze, BakuNano, Hyper Pulsor, BakuNano Daftorix, BakuNano Slicerix, BakuNano Jamsaber and BakuNano Orehammer for Team Anubias' Bakugan and Team Sellon' Bakugan. Drago is then defeated by all of them due to being a six on one fight and they had BakuNano's but when Dan was about to throw Drago back into the battle, Marucho stops him and sends back the brawlers alongside Dan into the interior of Bakugan Interspace. Marucho then deletes Area B and all of the Chaos Bakugan are deleted. Spectra was really disappointed and sad about Dan's attitude and decides to leaves the Brawlers temporarily. Meanwhile, Shun believes that Dan has no right to boss them around again due to him leaving. Dan then tells them he went to train at New Vestroia and they were all shocked. Dan also said all their training paid off but Paige and Rafe didn't believe them because they weren't able to control Mechtogan Zenthon. Drago then tells Dan they should tell them the truth and he does. He tells the Brawlers about the connection he has with Mag Mel and Razenoid and they will have to decide if they should take him in again after he abandoned them. Rafe and Paige seem to be disappointed about Dan's attitude towards Marucho, after he knew that he was the leader while Dan wasn't with the Brawlers and they decide to acknowledge Marucho as the leader. Dan later leaves after Marucho yelled at him and Shun also leaves talking to Taylean about Dan and he bangs a wall. In other point, because of Titanium Dragonoid's Mechtogan, Zenthon, Mag Mel and Razenoid finally have enough power to get free. They destroy their chains and a castle comes out of the ground on Gundalia. Razenoid also spawns a whole bunch of Chaos Bakugan and Mag Mel then commands his Chaos Bakugan to attack the place. That night, in Dan's house which is located in Bayview, he sees a vision of Gundalian Soldiers trying to hold off the Chaos Bakugan. The next day, Marucho, Shun, Rafe and Paige were talking about the Chaos Bakugan disappearing and Marucho didn't buy it. Dan then arrives and tells the Brawlers' about Gundalia, which surprised Paige because her homeland was attacked by the Chaos Bakugan but they all didn't believe it and Paige said: Why should we believe it?, then she said Dan was a crazy person. They then believe Dan when Paige receives a message from a Gundalian. Paige then says that he has to go to save her people but Marucho says that the brawlers and himself will come too. Dan offers to go with them to Gundalia, but she and the Brawlers say no; however, Dan said he has to go because he's the original brawler and this fight involves him too.",

        "Before the episode begins with the Battle Brawlers going through a Dimension Portal, to get to Gundalia, Dan goes with the other Brawlers because this fight involves him too. Once they arrive, they arrive at the city lines and see a desolate land which used to have homes. Later, two Gundalian guards confront them. Marucho says they are from Earth and they are the Battle Brawlers, Paige says that she is a Gundalian and Rafe says that he is a Castle Knight, but the guards don't believe them. Then, Ren arrives and says they are his friends. They find out he is now the leader of the Gundalian Forces. Ren then brings them to a secret hideout. When they arrive there, they receive a message from Nurzak, who has become the first Prime Minister of Gundalia. He welcomes the Brawlers and he is happy to see them back. Then he asks if Paige has been a good student and she concurs, which delights him. Then, Nurzak explain how a castle had emerged from underground out of nowhere, and an evil person called Mag Mel, with his brutish Bakugan, Razenoid, started it all. Then, Fabia Sheen appears on the screen in her Human Form and the Brawlers seem happy to see her once again. Rafe bows down as he reveals to Dan Kuso and the brawlers that she became the Queen while the former Queen (Serena Sheen), became the Ambassador of Gundalia and Neathia, surprising the Brawlers. Nurzak then says that he doesn't know why they came and attacked Gundalia so they had to fight and Queen Fabia said that the Castle Knights are coming to help the Gundalians in their fight against Mag Mel and Razenoid. Prime Minister Nurzak and Queen Fabia then leave. Ren then tells them that Chaos Bakugan are probably going to the center of Gundalia, where the Royal Palace is. Everyone then agrees with Ren but then Dan wants to help because he has a connection with Mag Mel and Razenoid however, Marucho tries to get Dan to sit this one out because of what happened before, and they end up arguing. Then, Ren asks if he should know anything about them fighting but they don't say that it's nothing. Later, Ren shows the Brawlers a map of the city lines but Dan feels a vision who shows Mag Mel with Razenoid and the army of Chaos Bakugan going North through a place called Dalia's Valley. Dan then says that Mag Mel and Razenoid are going North through Dalia's Valley. Ren knows that the Valley and it goes straight to the Royale Palace. Ren then asks Dan how he knows this and reveals to Ren and the Gundalian Soldiers that he is linked with Mag Mel and Razenoid. The Gundalian Soldiers don't trust Dan because he has a link with Mag Mel but dan says that he can be trusted and ren assures with a little bit of doubt. Marucho then devises and prepares a plan for an ambush. At the valley, the group waits for Mag Mel to arrive and Dan experience some pain in his head. However, they are the ones to get attacked by surprise from the sky. Rafe decides to give the BakuNano Sonicanon to Dan and the battle begins with all the Brawlers using BakuNano and as they and Ren attacks, Razenoid rises from the ground. They are stunned as Mag Mel arrives revealing that he can see visions of Dan too, so he knew about the attack. He attacks and eliminates all except for Dan, who begins to charge at Mag Mel but both of them hear a high pitch sound. Mag Mel believes their psychic connection creates high frequencies when they are too close. They both summon their Mechtogan, each with their own battle phrase. They and their Bakugan fight. After they fight, the result of an explosion leads to Dan losing. Mag Mel walks over to get the gate and key but is attacked by Neathian forces lead by Captain Elright, Aranaut on Rapilator, and an army of Haos Raptorix. Mag Mel and the Brawlers leave, but not before Marucho hears Mag Mel mention the \"gate and key\". The Gundalian Soldiers begin to doubt Dan Kuso because of his link with Mag Mel and Razenoid. Ren assures them that he is not spy for Mag Mel but he has his own doubts. Dan is angry that Mag Mel used him and Dan punches a wall, while Rafe discusses security upgrades because of the connection. At the end, Marucho looks at Dan with a deeply worried look.",

        "The episode begins with the Gundalian soldiers fighting back against the Chaos Bakugan. It seems that the Chaos Bakugan are defeating a huge amount of Gundalian Bakugan. The Gundalians then try to get revenge on the Chaos Bakugan and are starting to gain the upper hand but suddenly, all of them are all defeated by a Aquos-Darkus hybrid Cyclone Percival and a Pyrus-Darkus hybrid Iron Dragonoid owned by Sellon and Anubias. When they finished off the Gundalian's Bakugan, Anubias wondered where Dan is. Back at the base in Gundalia, the battle brawlers find out that the Chaos Bakugan are all heading to the city area, where there are Gundalians defending the area such as Mason and Jesse from Gundalian Invaders. Ren concludes that they are properly heading to Neathia so they can invade them next, as there is a Dimension Transporter in the area. They also think Mag Mel is hiding underground in his castle while he commands the Chaos Bakugan to attack Gundalia. Paige is eager to initiate a sneak attack but Captain Elright reminds her how the previous attempt ended. Dan insists to fight against Mag Mel but Marucho tells him not to, calling him a liability. Dan gets extremely frustrated and grabs Marucho by the collar and yells at him, that he has saved him over the past few years. He didn't stop until Rafe told him that it was enough. The group except for Dan leave as they hear that the Chaos Bakugan were invading the city lines. Taylean is on Zoompha while Shun is thinking. The city is under fire as the group continues to fight off the Chaos Bakugan. Dan then experiences another vision which shows Mag Mel telling Dan to surrender the Gate and Key, he desires. Dan then remember the phrase from the woman that they fought on New Vestroia before. They then leave by their selves on Zoompha but are interrupted by Shun and Taylean. Shun then asks what Dan is doing here and flips him. He then lectures him that he didn't change while he went to New Vestroia and then asks him to come with him. Dan gets up and then flips Shun. They then begin to fight but are attacked by an Army of Chaos Bakugan led by Anubias and they destroy both Titanium Dragonoid's and Taylean's Mobile Assault (Zoompha). Dan then uses BakuNano Sonicannon and they fight back alongside Shun. They are doing very well and defeat a large amount of Chaos Bakugan, but then Anubias summons Miserak and Venexus, so Dan and Drago summon Zenthon. Drago and Zenthon fight Miserak and Venexus but a swarm of Chaos Bakugan go after Drago, so Shun decides to use Hammermor and they fight them back. Later, Anubias summons Smasheon and defeats Taylean which hurts Shun. Dan, Drago and Zenthon then summon Zenthon Titan for extra help. He then fights against Smasheon and Venexus. Titanium Dragonoid then defeats Miserak with his Wonder Superior attack but Sellon arrives out of nowhere and summons Deezall, Rockfist and Braxion. They continue to fight and Drago defeats Braxion with the same attack easily. When Deezall and Rockfist are about to try to defeat Zenthon Titan they are both defeated by a long range shot by Marucho and Tristar with Cannongear who hacked Rafe's Mobile Assault to use as a Cannon and upgraded its power for Mechtogan targets. Smasheon then gets defeated by Zenthon and Venexus gets easily defeated by Zenthon Titan. Anubias then faints because of the power needed to control three Mechtogans at a time.

        "Dan With the war turning on the Chaos Bakugan, Linehalt, Aranaut, and the other Bakugan are trying to defend against them. While that is happening, Nurzak and Fabia talk about the War between Mag Mel and Gundalia. Nurzak speaks up and says that their next target will be Neathia if they are able to take Gundalia down. Fabia ensures him that the Battle Brawlers will definitely succeed because the Sacred Orb chose them. After the fall, Rafe and Dan get separated from Shun, Marucho and Paige. The Chaos Bakugan come after them and Rafe doesn't know what to do, wishing that Marucho and Shun were there to help them. Dan then tells Rafe that he will handle it and tells Drago to use Dragon Blazer on the roof and rocks tumble down which trap the Chaos Bakugan. Rafe is then amazed about what Dan and Drago just did and asks how he knew that. Dan says that he has learnt some things over the past few years. Dan then decides to go after Mag Mel and Razenoid. Rafe is suggesting that he should follow Dan, but Dan rejects the idea. Rafe then get mad and Dan explains everything to Rafe including the Gate and Key they have. Rafe then asks what is the Gate and Key and Drago say that their not really sure themselves. In the end, Dan becomes convinced and decides to trust his friends. He also realizes that they were trying to help him. Dan then tells Rafe to go to find the other Brawlers so they can help him while Dan goes after Mag Mel himself. Meanwhile, the rest of the team is having trouble during the battle against the Chaos Bakugan and Marucho wishes that Dan was here. Rafe then arrives and uses a BakuLaunch to throw Wolfurio which he is able to defeat most of them. Taylean then defeats the rest with Slash Rise Thunder.

Rafe then says it is more than that and he truly cares for the Brawlers. Shun then asks if he heard right and Marucho starts to cry. Rafe also mentions about the Gate and Key which Marucho remembers hearing Mag Mel mentioning it and he knew that he would be after it. Dan eventually finds Mag Mel and the masked villain explains the origin of their links. Mag Mel says that his link is a mutated link from Code Eve and his Gate and Key are incomplete. Also Mag Mel and Razenoid share their bond with Dan and Drago because they are from the same origin. He needs the Gate and Key from Titanium Dragonoid and Dan to become whole again alongside Razenoid and possibly become more powerful than Code Eve so he can rule all Bakugan in the world. He then summons six Mechtogan: Braxion, Smasheon, Rockfist, Deezall, Venexus, and Miserak with just a point to the sky. Sellon and Anubias appear when the six Mechtogan are summoned and at the nick of time, the rest of the Brawlers arrive. All the Brawlers forgive the differences with Dan who begins to battle against Mag Mel.

Mag Mel then says that he is not smart to share his powers with the other Brawlers so he and Razenoid summon Dreadeon, while Dan and Drago summon Zenthon. They begin to fight as the brawlers Mechtogon defeat the opposing Mechtogan except for Smasheon and Rockfist. Mag Mel orders Smasheon and Rockfist to fight Dan but suddenly, the Vestal Destroyer appears with Spectra Phantom, Infinity Helios and his BakuNano, Bombaplode defeating the two Mechtogan. Mag Mel then summons more Chaos Bakugan and Razenoid kicks Drago down. He begins to take the Gate from Drago, but is stopped by him. He and Dan then activated the Gate and Key. They then use an ability which seemingly destroys them. The war ended with Gundalia safe and Dan awaits for his punishment. However, Shun instead welcomes Dan back to the team, returning to be the leader of the Brawlers and counting with the support of Marucho and Spectra, who returns to Vestal in his ship. Everyone is happy, but suddenly, Drago's Gate appears and is changing color from light to dark constantly.

        "After the battle in Gundalia, Mag Mel desires the Key from Dan even more now. He also mentions that Razenoid will soon awaken (where he is inside some sort of cocoon) and he will soon become fully whole. Mag Mel then sends Anubias and Sellon to retrieve it. As Sellon desires to look good in front of Mag Mel, Anubias desires to destroy Dan. While Mag Mel is sending Anubias and Sellon to retrieve the Key from Dan, Queen Fabia and Nurzak thank the Battle Brawlers for their work against Mag Mel.

He also said that some noble brawlers tried to fend them off but they were unsuccessful. Marucho then realizes that because the Chaos Bakugan were destroying the area, the mainframe was damaged and that's why nobody can't get out. Luckily Kato finds another teleporter that is still intact and sends it to Marucho. Marucho then tells everyone and everyone then agrees to go there. Chris is also very worried about Sellon and says to Soon that they should send a message to her about where they are going. Soon says it is a great idea and she sends the message to Sellon.

The final blow from Shun against Sellon caused them to teleport away. The group arrives at the access point but now the point was damaged because of Shun and he apologizes. The other battlers start to lose hope and it begins to rain in Interspace. The problem is, Interspace wasn't programmed to rain.",
        "After the battle in Gundalia, Mag Mel desires the Key from Dan even more now. He also mentions that Razenoid will soon awaken (where he is inside some sort of cocoon) and he will soon become fully whole. Mag Mel then sends Anubias and Sellon to retrieve it. As Sellon desires to look good in front of Mag Mel, Anubias desires to destroy Dan. While Mag Mel is sending Anubias and Sellon to retrieve the Key from Dan, Queen Fabia and Nurzak thank the Battle Brawlers for their work against Mag Mel. Afterwards, Marucho then get a distress call on his BakuMeter, coming from Bakugan Interspace. The Battle Brawlers then say they have to go and Nurzak and Queen Fabia say if they need any help from Gundalia or Neathia just come and ask. They then head through a Dimension Portal but at the end, there is an electrical shock which makes them have a very hard landing. On arrival, they see Bakugan Interspace in ruins, then find Team Anubias running from a Darkus Cyclone Percival. Ben tries to be brave and throws a brick at the Cyclone Percival while he tells his teammates to go ahead and he will catch up. The rest of them run away and the Darkus Cyclone Percival then fires an attack and Ben falls down. When the Cyclone Percival is about to finish off Ben, he is saved by Drago's Dragon Blazer attack. The rest of the team arrives including Team Anubias and Dylan mysteriously appears. Dylan also somehow knows information about Mag Mel. Meanwhile, outside of Bakugan Interspace, Kato and Marucho's dad try to find a point to get any remaining battlers out of the system. Team Anubias then shows the Brawlers that they managed to round up the remaining battlers into a room. All of a sudden, Chris and Soon fall through the roof and land in the same place. Dylan then explains that when the Brawlers headed to Gundalia, the Chaos Bakugan began to invade Bakugan Interspace again. He also said that some noble brawlers tried to fend them off but they were unsuccessful. Marucho then realizes that because the Chaos Bakugan were destroying the area, the mainframe was damaged and that's why nobody can't get out. Luckily Kato finds another teleporter that is still intact and sends it to Marucho. Marucho then tells everyone and everyone then agrees to go there. Chris is also very worried about Sellon and says to Soon that they should send a message to her about where they are going. Soon says it is a great idea and she sends the message to Sellon. Since the Chaos Bakugan are in the center of Interspace, they plan to go around the area. Dylan appears again and begins to taunt the Brawlers. The group get furious at him and he reveals it is his job. He then takes off his glasses to reveal green technological eyes and that he is a robot created alongside Bakugan Interspace. He said that he created the BakuNano's and the Battle Gear to use in Interspace to create more heat and that he was created by Marucho. The Chaos Bakugan then find them but they are saved by Horridian. Anubias and Sellon arrive and their eponymous teams are happy to see them. However, their Leaders mock them for being stupid and they turn into their Real Forms. They insult their teammates which hurts Noah a lot and they reveal that they are Artificial Beings created by Mag Mel to aid him with his resurection. They begin a fight after Rafe and Paige escort the battlers to the Access Point. Anubias and Sellon use their \"Team's\" Bakugan and the Brawlers try to protect the Key.

        "Having both the Gate and the Key, Mag Mel is very close to his resurrection. However, he still only needs Dan's portion of Code Eve in order to begin his plan. Meanwhile, Dan and Shun are continuing to defend Bakugan Interspace against the Chaos Bakugan. Shun then comments that now that Mag Mel has both the Gate and the Key, they need to find out what his next move is. Dan agrees and suggests that they should to take down the Chaos Bakugan twice as fast so they can find Mag Mel. They then hear some more Chaos Bakugan arriving, so they split up to take them out. Meanwhile, Team Anubias is trying to find a way to escape. Jack then reflects on how Anubias tricked them, much to the dismay his teammates. Ben says, to not mention him again and as Robin declares that Anubias is gone, and that they are on their own now. Then suddenly, Anubias arrives and kidnaps Noah. As Drago defeats the last Chaos Bakugan that is there, Dan receives a transmission from Noah, but is shocked to see Anubias on the other end. Anubias then tells Dan to meet him in the arena in the middle of Bakugan Interspace so they can settle their score. Shun and Taylean overhear this conversation and Taylean wonders if they should stop him from going, but Shun does not answer. Meanwhile, Anubias decides to free Noah, having already goaded Dan into battling. Dan then arrives for the battle, and Noah and Shun watch. Anubias then throws out Horridian, Bolcanon, and Krakenoid and Dan throws out Drago. Drago manages to make quick work of Bolcanon and Horridian, but Anubias suddenly throws out Krowl, much to Dan and Drago's surprise. Anubias then fuses the two into Mutant Krakenoid and Mutant Krowl. Mutant Krowl then traps Drago with Haos Hydra. Dan and Drago respond by summoning Zenthon and he frees Drago and defeats Mutant Krowl. Anubias then summons Smasheon, Venexus and Deezall. Dan then summons Zenthon Titan, who easily defeats Smasheon and Deezall. Anubias then summons Venexus Titan, and he and Zenthon Titan begin fighting, but are evenly matched. Determined not to lose, Anubias pushes his power to his limits and destroys the bracelet on his arm. Mag Mel then receives a surge of energy from the battle and steps in to absorb his energy. Shun tries to stop Dan from trying to save Anubias as he would get absorbed as well, but Dan goes anyway and is unable to do anything as Mag Mel is too strong for Anubias and he is consumed by Mag Mel. Back on Interspace, Noah still can't believe that Anubias is really gone while Dan consumes too much hatred for revenge and decides to destroy Mag Mel once and for all.",

He tells the other Brawlers about this vision and suggests using his link to find and attack him. The others, however, disagree because of the many risks, including becoming comatose. He still takes this risk and goes ahead with the others defending, while Marucho tries to find a way out. In another area, Soon and Chris have lost confidence since Sellon's departure, with Soon more upset. They are then attacked by a Flash Ingram, but are saved by Noah and his Subterra Ziperator. Chris is surprised to see that he has become more confident, and although Soon says that they don't want his help, calling him a cowardly crybaby, Noah continues helping them. More Chaos Bakugan come, but the rest of Noah's team, Ben, Jack and Robin, arrive on Pyrus, Aquos and Ventus Ziperators, respectively. Soon doesn't believe that they have anything to fight for, after the people they trusted betrayed them, but Ben reassures her and the two girls run to the Battle Brawlers base. As Dan tries to clear his mind and look for Mag Mel, he finds him in a \"flip-side\" of Bakugan Interspace. The two begin to battle, summoning their Mechtogan and the two summon blades to fight each other.

Rafe tells them that their main priority is to protect Dan, who is no longer conscious, and the two girls regain their confidence and join the fight.

With that, Marucho realizes that as an AI, Dylan could do it. Shun helped Soon and Chris regain their passion for brawling, as his battling style reminded them of Sellon's ability and grace, and they used their own Bakugan to help defeat the Chaos Bakugan.

        "Still stuck in Bakugan Interspace, Dan and the other Brawlers are fighting off the Chaos Bakugan. Dan then has a vision that shows Mag Mel's desire to attack Earth, using Bakugan Interspace as a base for his operations. He tells the other Brawlers about this vision and suggests using his link to find and attack him. The others, however, disagree because of the many risks, including becoming comatose. He still takes this risk and goes ahead with the others defending, while Marucho tries to find a way out. In another area, Soon and Chris have lost confidence since Sellon's departure, with Soon more upset. They are then attacked by a Flash Ingram, but are saved by Noah and his Subterra Ziperator. Chris is surprised to see that he has become more confident, and although Soon says that they don't want his help, calling him a cowardly crybaby, Noah continues helping them. More Chaos Bakugan come, but the rest of Noah's team, Ben, Jack and Robin, arrive on Pyrus, Aquos and Ventus Ziperators, respectively. Soon doesn't believe that they have anything to fight for, after the people they trusted betrayed them, but Ben reassures her and the two girls run to the Battle Brawlers base. As Dan tries to clear his mind and look for Mag Mel, he finds him in a \"flip-side\" of Bakugan Interspace. The two begin to battle, summoning their Mechtogan and the two summon blades to fight each other.

He also says that Kato and his dad, Shuuko, are working very hard to reboot an access point. They then split into two groups: One group distracts the Chaos Bakugan while the other tries to round up the remaining battlers. Once they rounded all the battlers, the two groups meet up at the access point. The access point is then activated along with the deletion program. However, since Dylan doesn't want to be destroyed, he tells the Chaos Bakugan where the Brawlers were and they arrive there along with Dreadeon clones and the former Bakugan of Team Anubias and Team Sellon. The Brawlers fight them off but more Mechtogan arrive as some of the battlers begin to leave as they try to defeat the Bakugan, who attacks the BI and Krakenoid and Krowl mutate to form Mutant Krakenoid. The Bakugan prove too much but a Mechtogan attacks from the sky. The Brawlers has never seen it before and begin to wonder who it is until Infinity Helios appears and says that it is his Mechtogan, Slynix. Also, alongside him, Spectra Phantom comes to give a hand. With his addition, they are defeating many of the Dreadeon clones. However, Mutant Krakenoid switches into Mutant Krowl and uses Haos Hydra to trap Helios. Then, Venexus Titan is summoned and the Dreadeon clones makes a portal to summon Mag Mel. Drago suggests to do a mutation and Rafe explains that he can only mutate with a Bakugan of the same power level.

Meanwhile, the Dark Moon sends out energy waves, which transfer all the non battlers to the reverse dimension. He also summons five different attributed Razen Titans to the five biggests cities on Earth to drill holes into the Earth's core which will result in the Earth blowing up. He then appears in the sky as a vision to all that he will do the same to all opposing forces including Gundalia, Neathia, Vestal and New Vestroia. The Brawlers decide to split up and hunt down the Mechtogan Titans but this proves not to be simple as there are armies of Chaos Bakugan and Dreadeon Clones as protectors.

        "A long time has passed since Mag Mel and Razenoid were defeated and Earth, New Vestroia, Vestal, Gundalia, and Neathia were emptied of all the Chaos Bakugan. Everyone has returned home, including Spectra, Gus, Paige, Rafe, Taylean, Tristar, Boulderon, Wolfurio, Helios and Vulcan. As soon as everything turned back to normal, Mira arrived and brought her advanced Vestal technology to aid Marucho and the Marukura Corp into making the Bakugan Research Center, which is now the Bakugan Battle Brawlers Headquarters. Now that the Interspace is gone, the Marukura Corp and the Vestal scientists were able to create a new home for brawling in replacement of Bakugan Interspace known as Bakugan City. Once word got out about this place, all Bakugan from New Vestroia partnered up with humans and are now living there. That's not all, the Brawlers are still #1 with their new partners, like the rockin' hardcore ninja tag team of Shun and Ventus Jaakor. Next is the awesome smack talking but smart tag team of Marucho and Aquos Radizen. Finally we still got the ultimate brawlers, Dan and Pyrus Fusion Dragonoid. The first season of the Neo Bakugan City Tournament is about to end with the top 4 brawlers, Dan, Shun, Marucho, and Gunz Lazar battle it out. Julie is also back as the new announcer for battles, including her rule (to avoid danger) of no Mechtogan during battles. Marucho, although making a top notch scientific plan to take down Gunz and his Haos Reptak, Marucho and Radizen lose. Next up is the long awaited brawl between Dan and Shun, with Dan mimicking Shun and Jaakor's ninja style of brawling to win the match. After the battle, Shun questions how did Dan get those ninja skills. Dan replies saying from TV as Shun smiles. The final round is Dan VS Gunz in the finals, and who will win? Meanwhile in the now incredibly empty Doom Dimension, Fury is shown being betrayed by his Mechtogan Coredegon, who then kills him. Coredegon, along with Aquos Mandibor, Pyrus Slycerak, and Haos Exostriker are being rogue Mechtogan and want to make all Bakugan extinct. 8 Rogue Bakugan refuse to be betrayed by the ones they created but warn them not to go to Earth because of the threat that is the Battle Brawlers. Of course, the stubborn Mechtogan ignore this warning and head out anyway, with a Ventus Worton (called Professor Worton) left afraid of the outcome. During the brawl between Dan and Gunz, Drago and Reptak are battling hand to hand combat until they Fusion Dragonoid's and Reptak's attack collides. Coredegon and the other Mechtogan arrived and Coredegon plans to destroy every Bakugan in the stadium, which causes massive chaos with Mira and Julie escorting everyone out. Dan, Gunz, Shun, and Marucho then battle the four Mechtogan off, but they are all defeated easily when all 4 of the Mechtogan combine to form the mighty Mechtavius Destroyer. Julie, Mira, and other spectators are seen cheering for Dan who then uses his powers with Drago to spawn Dragonoid Destroyer. Dragonoid Destroyer is known to be a Mechtogan Destroyer and he then speaks to Dan and Drago telling them to join him in his fight against the Mechtogan. The true Destroyer Showdown commences and the Mechtogan seem to be winning until Dragonoid Destroyer shows his true strength all blasts all four of them back to the Doom Dimension, with all of them cursing Dan and the others, After Coredegon escapes, Mira and Julie high-five, the audience cheers, but Marucho worries about whether or not these Mechtogan will return, a mysterious masked man named Wiseman is seen staring and laughing at the outcome of the battle.",

After that, they go to the Bakugan Research Center in Bakugan City where Reptak explains his story to the Battle Brawlers. Jaakor, Radizen and Roxtor don't believe him, but then Mira says that it is a little unrealistic. Some time later, Mira shows Dan the data she was able to retrieve from his Bakumeter about the strange Mechtogan and Dragonoid Destroyer. The Brawlers then discover that Dragonoid Destroyer has two spaces on his shoulders to launch Bakugan during a battle. Meanwhile, in the Doom Dimension, the Nonet Bakugan wonder if Coredegon and the Mechtogan were victorious against the Bakugan, and they decide to ask Worton, but he tells them to be patient. Then a human calling himself Wiseman appears to them and offers them their freedom in exchange for their help in summoning the four Mechtogan that attacked Bakugan City earlier. Then they head down to Bakugan City and immediately start wreaking havoc on the construction site. Julie would report what was going on at the construction site and told Dan to get down there with the other brawlers. When the Brawlers appear to battle, they got hammered by the Nonet Bakugan and Mechtogan until they summoned Dragonoid Destroyer and were about to unleash a jumping attack with Jaakor and Radizen until Mira told them that since Radizen is not a Baku-Sky Raider, he cannot be used in a jumping attack and then found out that Reptak could be used because he is a Baku-Sky Raider. So, Dan and Drago summoned Dragonoid Destroyer and then attached Reptak and Jaakor to Dragonoid Destroyer and they launched the jumping attack. Then Mira creates an Aquos Blasterate for Radizen and he and Marucho join the battle and easily repel the Nonet Bakugan and the Mechtogan. Wiseman, defeated, leaves the scene. Dan tries to go after him, but he disappears. The Brawlers wonder who he was, but Reptak says that the way that he launches Bakugan was similar to his missing partner Gunz.",

Then a human calling himself Wiseman appears to them and offers them their freedom in exchange for their help in summoning the four Mechtogan that attacked Bakugan City earlier. Then they head down to Bakugan City and immediately start wreaking havoc on the construction site. Julie would report what was going on at the construction site and told Dan to get down there with the other brawlers. When the Brawlers appear to battle, they got hammered by the Nonet Bakugan and Mechtogan until they summoned Dragonoid Destroyer and were about to unleash a jumping attack with Jaakor and Radizen until Mira told them that since Radizen is not a Baku-Sky Raider, he cannot be used in a jumping attack and then found out that Reptak could be used because he is a Baku-Sky Raider. So, Dan and Drago summoned Dragonoid Destroyer and then attached Reptak and Jaakor to Dragonoid Destroyer and they launched the jumping attack. Then Mira creates an Aquos Blasterate for Radizen and he and Marucho join the battle and easily repel the Nonet Bakugan and the Mechtogan. Wiseman, defeated, leaves the scene. Dan tries to go after him, but he disappears. The Brawlers wonder who he was, but Reptak says that the way that he launches Bakugan was similar to his missing partner Gunz.",
        "The episode begins right after the battle between the Battle Brawlers and the Mechtogan. The Battle Brawlers start looking for Gunz but then run into Reptak, who is also looking for Gunz. After that, they go to the Bakugan Research Center in Bakugan City where Reptak explains his story to the Battle Brawlers. Jaakor, Radizen and Roxtor don't believe him, but then Mira says that it is a little unrealistic. Some time later, Mira shows Dan the data she was able to retrieve from his Bakumeter about the strange Mechtogan and Dragonoid Destroyer. The Brawlers then discover that Dragonoid Destroyer has two spaces on his shoulders to launch Bakugan during a battle. Meanwhile, in the Doom Dimension, the Nonet Bakugan wonder if Coredegon and the Mechtogan were victorious against the Bakugan, and they decide to ask Worton, but he tells them to be patient.

Meanwhile, the Battle Brawlers are analyzing the recollected data about the Nonet Bakugan, the evil Mechtogan, the stolen Battle Suits, and Wiseman himself, but they don't have enough information, so they decide to look for information from anyone they can ask. While they do this, Wiseman and the other Nonet Bakugan are getting ready for their battle against the Brawlers, but still they are not sure of trusting the evil Mechtogan.

Aerogan transports to Bakugan City but gets a less-than-welcome greeting from each of the Bakugan requesting for a battle.

Wiseman and Worton were discussing if the Brawlers were still alive or not. After that, Worton asked Wiseman if he knew where Balista was, but he told him that he didn't know. Wiseman appeared before Gunz, revealed his face, and told Gunz how he was created from his jealousy of Dan. After that, he let Gunz look around to find Reptak. Meanwhile, Dan, Marucho, and Shun were in Kato's submarine after having fallen off a cliff. Reptak explained that Gunz was willing to fight Dan as a rookie, but when he lost, he got very mad, but Reptak encouraged him that no matter what, if they just train hard, they will win. Once his story was over, Mira announced that she made duplicates of the Battle Suits Wiseman stole. Once they were geared up and ready to fight, they headed off to the island. After Gunz took a drink of water on a fountain, he saw Reptak and called for him but they thought he is Wiseman, since Wiseman looks like Gunz. Wiseman then shows up out of nowhere and teleported Gunz to his base. Shocked by this, the Brawlers were enraged for Wiseman pretending to be Gunz. Wiseman then threw Spatterix, Stronk, and Worton, including the Battle Suits that he stole. Later on, he sends out Betadron, Kodokor, Mutabrid, and Tremblar. After a long battle, Wiseman had enough energy, and revealed his true identity, Coredegon. Coredegon then shot a wave that defeated all the Brawlers' Bakugan, and revealed that he was using the Nonets all this time, and his true plan was to take over the world.",

The battle gets more fierce as Gunz learns from Wiseman/Coredegon that he copied Gunz's appearance by absobing his evil energy and reverting it. After that, the Nonets are told that he will give them two options, while transforming to his true Mechtogan form, they must choose to either return to the Doom Dimension or be buried alive.

        "Gunz and Reptak have created a new Mechtogan, Chromopod. Upon his arrival, Dragonoid Destroyer begins to use 100% of his power. He soon goes through a \"metamorphosis\" that turns him golden and enormous. It is revealed that his infinite power comes from the bond between Bakugan and humans all over the world. With a single blast, Dragonoid Destroyer destroys Mechtavius Destroyer for good. Dan and Drago then meet the original Dragonoid, Genesis Dragonoid, who congratulates them on their victory. He had been using Dragonoid Destroyer as a vessel to speak to them. He tells them that he is proud of Dan, Drago, and the other humans for getting along so well with the Bakugan and being able to spawn Mechtogan. He explains a little more about Fury and the Nonets whom he banished to the Doom Dimension, and how he had never suspected that Nonets' hate would grow so strong that they would be able to escape. Meanwhile, one more brawl still remains left undecided. The final match of the Neo Bakugan City Tournament is finally under way. Gunz and Reptak fight their hardest against Dan and Drago, but despite putting up a good fight, Dan and Drago defeat them, and remain as the champions. To celebrate his victory, Dan's friends throw him a party, but soon discover Dan is missing. Shun sees Dan and Drago sailing off using a boat borrowed from Kato. Dan says that another adventure is waiting for him and Drago, and that he had enough time in the spotlight, such that he wants to let other Brawlers to rise to his rank.",

He has found the ghost Giselle, who has been calling to him, and is offered a rosemary flower, which will allow Giselle to take him with her to the land of the dead. Rue tries to save him by dancing with Giselle, but fails. When Rue falls, Duck hides and transforms into Princess Tutu. Tutu reveals herself to Rue and dances with Giselle. She successfully gains the feeling of sadness from Giselle and gives it to Mytho. Drosselmeyer notes that the feelings returned to the Prince, thus far, are unhappy ones, and asks Tutu, \u201cis this how you will restore happiness to the Prince?\u201d"

        "Rue looks through The Prince and the Raven, and is confronted by Fakir. She hints that Princess Tutu may be real. Meanwhile, Duck learns about the Fire Festival. Duck has been charged with cleaning the room of the advanced class. She arrives at the classroom and finds Mytho, dressed in Festival garb, awaiting Rue to practice together. Since she is absent, he decides to dance with Duck instead, to her joy. Fakir sees the two and confronts Mytho, telling him to just listen to him. The two leave and Rue appears. The two talk for a few moments, and Duck goes out in search of Mytho. As punishment for not listening to him, Fakir locks Mytho in a closet. Outraged, Duck tries to open the locked door, and lets slip that she knows that Mytho is regaining the pieces of his heart. Fakir becomes suspicious and questions her. Duck discovers that both Rue and Fakir know about Mytho being the Prince from the story. Fakir aggresively tells Duck that Mytho does not need a heart. In the closet, Mytho hears a voice talking to him from a strange glowing panel in the floor. Edel appears once more, and points out an open window that Duck can go through. She does and she falls onto the glowing panel, which opens and causes her to tumble down into some catacombs. She goes in search of Mytho, and a voice begins telling her riddles. She gets them all wrong, but finds the room Mytho is in, regardless, and gets locked in the room. She transforms into Princess Tutu, and finally gets that the answer to the riddles, revealing the voice as a lamp with a piece of heart. Tutu dances while the lamp spotlights her. The lamp reveals that she once shone for people, but was cast aside. She now wants Mytho so that she can shine for him. Tutu talks the lamp into releasing Mytho, and promises to take the lamp with her. Mytho\u2019s feeling of affection is returned to him. Rue, waiting for Mytho at the plaza even after the festival ends, finally turns to leave but finds Mytho in her path. They dance while Duck looks on, lamp in hand. Smiling, Rue looks up at Mytho, to find him looking at her with gentle eyes. His emotion surprises her, and she runs away. Fakir is seen glaring, and Duck looks unhappily after Rue.",
