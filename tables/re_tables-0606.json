Lieutenant Dupre plans to lead the attack and use Lieutenant Arbeo Pippiniden\u2019s Tomliats. Uso takes the Core Fighter and Boots with Shakti and Karlmann to go investigate the enemy tactics at Arti Gibraltar. Uso discovers Lieutenant Dupre\u2019s forces at point \u201cDD\u201d. Uso tries to flee and Lieutenant Dupre orders it to be captured once he see that the pilot is a boy, thinking of his own son. The Shrike Team, made up entirely of women, arrives and engages the enemy. Uso forms the Victory Gundam. BESPA is quickly overwhelmed and begin to take heavy losses. The remaining BESPA forces retreat. Commander Oliver explains that the DD plan is to attack the BESPA Largane Base. Commander Oliver punches Uso for his reckless behavior."

Gabe and Amy join the strike, but Bob wants Mrs. Dabney's yapping dog to shut up. They all whind up in the tree house and it fell to the ground. However, when Mrs. Dabney reveals the dog is not hers and she's just watching it for a neighbor, the Duncans launch a water balloon at her. In the end, Bob, PJ, and Gabe build a new tree house."

        "The AEUG is devastated both physically and mentally after the final battle against the Titans and Axis. With the loss of most of their forces, they decide to hide themselves in Side-1's Shangri-La colony and begin their recovery efforts. A boy named Judau Ashta, after collecting and doing his job as a junk dealer, find a pod containing Yazan, still alive. After talking with him regarding the Argama, they decide to work together to steal the Zeta Gundam, though Judau and his friends want to just sell the mobile suit. At the port, Fa places Kamille in an ambulance and is about to leave when Judau and Yazan take her hostage. Shinta and Qum hide under the ambulance, and Judau searches the back and finds the vegetative Kamille. Kamille looks at him and holds out his hand, so Judau touches him and shares a strange Newtype experience with the comatose pilot. As they head for the Argama's dock, Yazan tells Judau they should have no trouble with the Argama's diminished crew. And despite being hardly armed with little more than vegetables and one Titan, Yazan proves to be right, as Judau is successfully able to steal the Zeta Gundam, but has trouble starting it up. But after Yazan kills Saegusa during the assault and reveals his true colors as a Titan, he activates the Zeta Gundam. Armed in only a Petite, Yazan attacks anyway, trying to get the Gundam himself. Unfortunately, Judau's control of the machine is poor, and they are forced into the colony. Abandoning the Petite as it is useless, Yazan boards a Middle mobile suit. Judau eventually pulls out a beam saber, but drops it, allowing Yazan to pick it up and gain the advantage, at least until Judau destroys the suit with forearm grenades and defeats Yazan. Afterwards, Bright is able to subdue the Zeta Gundam with a Petite and some wires, but Beecha and the rest of Judau's friends activate bombs. During this distraction, both Judau and Yazan manage to escape. In space, the Neo Zeon ship Endra sends a briefcase over to Shangri-La.",

Roux informs Judua of Leina\u2019s capture, leaving Judau distressed and angered."

Believing the pilot to be the leader of Neo Zeon, Haman Karn, Bright is left with no choice but to fire the new cannon to attempt to defeat her, however the blast misses the Qubeley and destroys and abandoned colony with great destructive power. Judau is shocked at the destruction caused, and is completely overcome with fear that Leina is in danger so long as she is in Axis, resulting in him deserting the Argama to mount a solo rescue of Leina at Axis.",

        "The episode starts with another voice over - Judau tells us that the Argama is now in orbit of the Earth, and could be attacked at any time. We also see something being delivered to the ship, Quattro Bajina's Ms - the Hyaku shiki (Type 100). Bright and Mika are talking, and Mika tells us that AEUG's high command have ordered that the Argama destroys the Sandra before it reaches Earth with its main cannon. Beecha and Mondo suggest a plan to Judau, which is to attach bombs all around the ZZ, so the enemy won't attack in fear of an explosion that may catch them as well, and he can get Leina back.

Puru seems to accept this, and offers to take care of Leina while Judau goes off to help his friends, who are valiantly defending them from Glemy forces.

Puru, realizes that Leina has a fever, and so goes to wet a handkerchief to cool her down. During the fight, Glemy's escort, a woman in a Dowadge gets shot down, with the suit landing straight onto where Lene laid half asleep. It bursts into flames. Team August is overwhelmed by the AEUG, and they retreat, as does Haman's flagship, which is under pressure by the returning Ahgama. Judau rushes to the burnt out hut where Lene was, but there is nothing remaining apart from a burnt out shoe.

Puru tries to console him, \"In the future, I could be your Leina\", but he pushes her aside, as she starts crying harder.",

Soon other members of the Africa resistance begin destroying the city to full remove the foreign influence, influenced by August the acting commander of the Mindra, forcing the blue team to engage them as they oppose the destruction. The gundam team and Glemy flee, Glemy returns to the Mindra and scolds August for his actions and joins the battle, while judau and the others reunite with Roux and move the gundams out to save the city. Glemy resumes command of the blue team and convinces the other resistance fighters to fight against the gundams, who soon arrive.

The remainder of the gundam team scout the area, and Glemy decides it is time to awaken Puru Two, and her awakening startles both Puru and Kamille. Judau's anger combined with his new-type powers forces Rakan to retreat, while Puru warns Bright of an approaching threat, which is Puru Two in the Psyco Gundam Mk II. The Argama fails to shoot her down so Puru confronts her in a still damaged Qubeley Mk II, with the two combatants reacting to each other's familiar newtype presence. Puru Two dominates Ple until Judau arrives and sends Puru back to the Argama while he deals with the Psyco Gundam. The gundam team find the Auduhmula with the rescued civilians safe, but find the crew dead, so they contact the Argama to rendezvous. Judau struggles against Puru Two, with the situation turning grimmer as the Double Zeta begins to run out of power, but is saved by a returning Puru who realizes that their opponent is a clone of herself, and reveals this to Puru Two, greatly surprising her. Wanting to save Judau, Puru summons all of her newtype powers and kamikazes the Qubeley into the Pysco Gundam, killing her and badly damaging the gundam, but Puru Two survives. Puru Two then prepares to finish Judau, but his anger and anguish at Purus death allows him to activate the ZZ's bio sensor and destroy the Psyco Gundam, but Puru Two ejects. Judau continues his attack, but stops when he sees that the pilot looks exactly like Puru. Everyone reunites on the Argama and mourns the death of their allies and the civilians.",

        "It is revealed that since the colony drop was successful, Haman has returned to space, so the Argama crew does the same, leaving behind the Argama with Karaba. As they leave they are watched by some of their friends: a reunited Kamille and Fa, and, surprisingly, Bright\u2019s old subordinate Sayla Mass accompanied by a very much alive Leina Ashta. In Space the crew reunites with the La Vie en Rose and sees their new ship the Nahel Argama. Judau and co explore their new ship, while Bright meets with his superior; both Bright and the crew, who were eavesdropping, are shocked to hear that the gundam team is to be decommissioned and Bright is to command the Nahel Argama with a new, more \u201cprofessional\u201d crew. Judau, Bright, and the crew adamantly refuse this as they have been through everything together and have proven themselves capable, but their accomplishments are denounced, with Judau and his friends being labeled as mere children. At that moment the Argama\u2019s old enemy, Mashymre Cello, along with his new ship and subordinate Illia Pazom attack. Illia leads the attack to destroy the new Argama in her ReGelg, so the Argama crew launches the Nahel Argama to draw fire away from the Rose. A direct hit to the ship causes Shinta, Qum, and some new pilots to be ejected from the ship, so Bright launches in a small vessel to save them while Judau launches in the ZZ to deal with Illia. Illia\u2019s fast mobile suit allows her to outmaneuver Judau, however they begin to react to each other\u2019s Newtype powers distracting her long enough for Judau to successfully execute a sneak attack. Illia survives and captures Judau\u2019s but his unorthodox strategy mixed with the continuous reaction of their Newtype powers, allows him to stall her long enough for Elle in the Mk II to damage her suit, forcing a retreat with the rest of her units. Back on board the Nahel Argama, the crew realizes that Bright has been through enough, and let him (along with Shinta, Qum, and Haro) stay with the La Vie en Rose, and they head out to face Haman, with Bright, believing in their skill and strength, wishes them luck and farewell.",
