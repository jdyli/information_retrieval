Now let us remember and celebrate our patrons: Enriched by their generosity, Ennobled by their greatness, Let us give them honour."

Meanwhile, Chihaya is saddened after nearly all of the first year members leave the club, leaving just a boy named Akihiro Tsukuba. When Kana calls Sumire out on her personal prettifying, she reveals that she is only sticking with karuta to pursue Taichi. During practise, Chihaya takes keen interest in Akihiro, who is experienced in Second Verse Karuta, whilst also noting how Sumire felt when obtaining her first card. When Chihaya asks Sumire to trim her nails, she ends up blurting about her crush on Taichi and runs off. When the others question Chihaya on why she is serious about the first years, she reveals that she wanted more members in order to avoid another incident like when they lost the team tournament due to her collapsing. As Yusei starts teaching Akihiro competitive karuta, Kana catches up to Sumire, managing to calm her down and convince her to return to the clubroom. Learning that karuta, much like love, is determined by its rules, Sumire decides to take karuta a bit more seriously.",

After drying off at his place, Arata asks Chihaya to play a game of Karuta with him, where he shows tremendous skill. At the end of the game, Chihaya manages to use what she knows of the game to obtain one card for herself, a card which bears the name 'Chihaya'. Inspired by Arata's dream to become a karuta master, she decides that her dream is to become the strongest female karuta player--or karuta Queen."

Taichi makes a bet that if he can beat Arata in a tournament, he will be ignored until graduation. Jealous of Chihaya's admiration of Arata, Taichi continues to harass the other boy, making him spill coke all over himself. As both Taichi and Arata make their way to the final, Taichi steals Arata's glasses, making it difficult to see. Although Arata manages to cope on memory alone, Taichi swaps the cards around to make things difficult.

        "Miles Connor, a powerful Teklord busted by Jake and Sid , has been sent into cryogenic incarceration for his crimes. However, Connor soon reappears in person and begins killing those responsible for putting him away. When Jake and Sid check the freezer to see if Connor has escaped, they find that he is indeed still in prison. They discover that the new Connor is a computer program, an artificial intelligence personality simulation that the \"real\" Connor developed in order to maintain his empire. The program, having inherited Connor's ambition, ruthlessness and desire for revenge, proves to be far deadlier than any human opponent.",

His father blames a controversial and ultra-violent interactive virtual-reality game in which cops and Tek Lords battle for supremacy. The game's manufacturer denies responsibility for the killings. He claims that it is merely a game, and he can't helpit if a few lunatics are going off the deep end.

On the run from the police, Jake must turn to Sam to help prove his innocence and prevent Neville from releasing a massive shipment of Tek into the city.",
        "Jake can't believe it when Sharon Neville, a love lost many years ago, walks back into his life only to report her own murder. He's even more skeptical when she turns out to be a professional identity double who says the killer was none other than Sharon's husband, Police Commissioner Bob Neville and that Sharon was murdered because she had evidence he was dealing Tek. When Sharon's body is found, Jake realizes the woman is telling the truth and goes after Neville. However, the Police Commissioner is one step ahead of him and uses his position and power to frame Jake for Sharon's murder. On the run from the police, Jake must turn to Sam to help prove his innocence and prevent Neville from releasing a massive shipment of Tek into the city."
