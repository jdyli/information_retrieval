Lessons may include more exploratory material supportive of conceptual understanding, rather than direct presentation of facts and methods. Emphasis may be on practical applications and greater issues such as the environment, gender and racial diversity, and social justice. Mathematics lessons may include writing, drawing, games, and instruction with manipulatives rather than filling out worksheets. Lessons may include exploration of concepts allowing students to invent their own procedures before teaching standard algorithms. Grading may be based on demonstration of conceptual understanding rather than entirely on whether the final answer is correct. In some countries (e.g. the United States), there may be expectations of high achievement and mastering algebra for all students rather than tracking some students into business math and others into mathematics for math and science careers."
