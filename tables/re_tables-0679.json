During the steps of creating a datasource users also are given a chance to create a data model describing how columns or fields relate to each other creating hierarchies of relationships like Time: Year, Quarters, Months, Weeks and Product Division, Category, Type etc. The resultant model is used by Mondrian and any other plugin like Analyzer or Saiku to create new queries against the newly created data source. This component is part of what Pentaho introduces as agile BI, which simply means having a way to start from basic data and quickly iterate through steps to discover the proper way to structure, study and present the data."

        "Because various members of Nice and Jacuzzi's gang worked for the Genoard, Eve allows Nice, Jacuzzi, and their gang to stay in the Genoard mansion. The gang returns from selling the explosives they stole from the Pussyfoot ' s cargo, but they also rescued Chane and are unsure what to do with her. Although Jacuzzi welcomes her into the group, the others remain suspicious of her. Elsewhere, Claire finds and recognizes Czeslaw and Rachel. Chane receives a white dress as a gift, and she knows that Claire sent it. She remembers how happy she was when Huey gave her clothes. However, she is unsure how she should feel about this dress. She wonders what Claire was thinking when he proposed, but it does not help her understand her situation. Chane goes out for a walk and is abducted by Graham, who mistakes her for Eve. Graham sends Jacuzzi a note, instructing him to gather as much money as possible and then come to meet him alone. Once Jacuzzi arrives, he learns that Nice, their gang, and Claire followed him. However, no one recognizes Claire, so he introduces himself as the Rail Tracer. Claire confronts Chane and declares his love for her. However, this confuses Chane because she never had friends who cared or someone, not even her father, who never said he loved her. Graham is furious that Claire defeated Ladd on the train, and Claire declares that he is happy to fight Graham to defend Chane.",

Anubis and a bunch of Dynasty soldiers chase down Mia and Ully, believing that the two will lead them to Ryo, but they are saved by the Ancient One who uses his staff to open a giant chasm, taking out the Dynasty soldiers, though Anubis emerges unharmed. The staff also restores power to the city and finding Mia's abandoned jeep working now, Mia and Ully head off again to find Ryo. Ryo climbs out of the volcano, but is attacked by Anubis. White Blaze returns his missing sword, but Anubis knocks him back into the volcano again. However, Ryo's power is increased and he emerges as more than a match for Anubis. Anubis captures Mia and Ully and Ryo is unable to approach them as his armor is hot enough to incinerate them. Anubis casts them into the volcano to force Ryo to get rid of his armor to rescue them then prevents him from resummoning it and beats him up and tosses him in the volcano again, but Ryo manages to pull Anubis in with him. Both manage to get to safety in the volcano which starts to erupt. Ryo calls upon his armor again and destroys Anubis' weapons as the volcano erupts and knocks Anubis into the eruption, but Anubis survives and is yelled at by Talpa for his failure. Mia, Ully, Ryo and White Blaze vow to find the remaining Warriors who they believe are still alive and Ryo accepts that they need to work as a team to defeat the Dynasty. This pleases the Ancient One who is watching from nearby."

Not having a way to do so themselves, they realize that Talpa will try to destroy Rowen himself and they decide to try to find out what that method will be. Mia proposes that two of the Warriors find out Talpa's plan while the other two return to the city. When the Warriors get into an argument about who will go, Mia chooses Cye and Sage herself, but that night, Ryo, Kento and White Blaze sneak off to do the job themselves after telling Ully to tell Mia when she wakes up. Talpa summons the Nether Spirits to deal with Rowen, explaining to the Warlords that the spirits can combine their powers together to create a great ball of energy that will be able to destroy anything its sent against. Talpa plans to send it to destroy Rowen. As Kento and Ryo approach the building where the energy ball is, Talpa sends Dynasty soldiers to distract them. Though they easily defeat them, the energy ball is launched, but the Ancient One intervenes and destroys it. Talpa calls upon the spirits again to form another one while sending Anubis to stop Ryo and Kento. The two battle him, then, knowing they're running out of time, armor up and start climbing the building. However, the energy from the ball strikes Anubis and gives him even more power and then while he battles Ryo and Kento, causes their armor to start squeezing them to death. The energy ball starts to launch and Ryo, seeing his only chance to save Rowen, jumps on it to ride it into space, but is absorbed by the ball. Kento meets up with the others and informs them of what happened and they watch as the ball launches into space.",

The soldiers also go after Mia and Ully along with possessed cars and it forces the Warriors to split up which Sage realizes is the Dynasty's intention: to use Mia and Ully to split the Warriors up so they're weaker. Sage, Mia and Ully escape the subway only to be confronted by Dynasty soldiers. Sage armors up and takes them out while across the city the other Warriors take out the soldiers attacking them, but they are scattered. A building is brought down forcing Sage, Ully and Mia back into the subway where they are confronted by Cale. He absorbs all the light in the subway and Sage's light power. Sage is unable to unleash his Thunder Bolt Cut for fear of hitting Mia and Ully and Cale captures him with his Black Lightning Flash. The attack drains Sage of his energy and causes his armor to disappear, but before it can kill him, Ully attacks Cale with the Ancient One's staff. Ully is injured by an attack from Cale, but the staff frees Sage and restores his power along with the light in the subway. Sage calls upon his armor again and blasts Cale away with his Thunder Bolt Cut and apologizes to Ully as he had always thought of Ully as a burden. However, the Warriors are still scattered across the city. Also, the Ancient One's staff disappears.",

Kento is skeptical at first that its really Rowen, but Rowen makes a joke about how he found Kento by his growling stomach and he seems to be convinced. Meanwhile, Talpa addresses Cale, Dais and Sekhmet and informs them that together the Ronin armors are unbeatable, but now that they're separate, they are vulnerable. He plans to use the Ronins own strengths against them and assigns Dais to the task, though he doesn't tell him the plan. In the subway, Kento is anxious to get out and find the others and suggests blasting out while Rowen cautions that their job is to protect and rebuild and not destroy. Two subway trains come at them, sending them different ways on the track to separate them again. Rowen manages to get out of the way by clinging to the celing, but Kento has to battle several Dynasty soldiers on his train and when it heads for a pile of rock, climbs on top to escape, but is thrown into a field. There he sees images of the Dark Warlords and Talpa speaks to him. Talpa reveals that the field contains the bones of every mortal that fell to the Ronin armor and that the Ronin armors and the Warlord armors have the same origin. He also reveals that the Ronin armors used to be worn by men that used them to conqur and that while the people wearing them grow stronger the more they're used, so too grows the bloodlust. Talpa believes that it will eventually bring the Warriors over to his side and that they will help him conqur everything. The other Warriors attack Kento and he defeats them, but its revealed to be all just one of Dais' illusions. He and Talpa try to convince Kento to join them, telling him that the armor contains evil and that its bloodthirsty nature will eventually overwhelm him and cause him to turn. Dais and Talpa claim that Kento's armor was always the most blood-thristy of the group and thus he will be the first to turn. Dais sends an illusion of an army at Kento and while he realizes what it is, he feels the urge to kill. Kento armors up and battles Dais and when he grows angry, the armor seems to take control of him somewhat. After taunting Kento by attacking him in the guise of his friends, Dais causes Kento to hit him with Iron Rock Crusher. The attack shatters the illusion and blasts Dais away, but also causes destruction in the city, attracting Rowen to Kento's position. Talpa speaks to Kento, telling him to look at the destruction he caused and saying he proved that all Kento will cause is destruction and that he will soon join his side. Rowen and Kento reunite, but Kento now has doubts about the nature of his and the other Ronins armor and what will happen. Talpa congratulates Dais and tells him his plan is not over yet and that Anubis will handle the next part. Dais doesn't believe Anubis worthy, but Talpa assures him that Anubis has changed.",

The Ancient One commends the Ronin Warriors for all of the good they have done so far and Mia for helping to bring the Warriors together. The Ancient One confirms that the Ronin and Warlord armors do share the same origin and that they can be bent to either good or evil. According to the Ancient One, Talpa knows that the armors can be used to destroy him and will be working to bend the Warriors armors to evil and Talpa can bend the Ronin armor to his will if goodness isn't in the Ronins hearts and souls. Anubis awakens and the Ancient One stops the Warriors from attacking him so he can talk to him and try to convince him to change sides. By this point, Anubis has seen enough that he understands that Talpa is only using him for his armor and the Ancient One explains that the nine armors were once all one and are formed out of human emotions. Anubis' virtue is Loyalty which means he is loyal to whoever is his master, but the Ancient One points out that Anubis can choose his own master. The Ancient One walks away after telling Anubis to no longer be controlled by Talpa (which he has been for over a thousand years) and to pick his own path and follow it. Realizing Anubis is lost to him, Talpa sends all three Dark Warlords to attack Anubis and retrieve his armor. By the time they arrive, Anubis has come to the conclusion that the Ancient One is right and fights back against them but is easily defeated. However, before the Warlords can take Anubis to Talpa, the Ronin Warriors attack and engage them in battle. The Warriors hold off the Warlords, but Talpa blinds them temporarily with a bolt of energy, allowing the Warlords to escape with Anubis. The Warriors are more determined than ever to attack Talpa's castle and defeat him and the Ancient One agrees to become the bridge to the castle, but worries about the power of the Dark Side within. In the castle, Anubis is brought before Talpa and tries to no avail to convince the other Warlords of the truth and is thrown in the dungeon. The Warlords ask for the power of the Dark Side to make them stronger so they can defeat the Warriors, but Talpa reveals the source is pure evil and demands they prove themselves ready for the power. As the Warriors discuss the upcoming attack on the castle and Ryo's fears about what the Ancient One told them about their armor, the Ancient One summons Talpa and does battle with him. The Ancient One is no match for Talpa and is destroyed, but as his last act he turns himself into a bridge to Talpa's castle. The Warriors hear the commotion and are saddened when they realize the Ancient One's sacrifice, but prepare themselves to make use of it to finally assault Talpa's castle. At the same time, Talpa is aware of what the Ancient One planned and is amused, planning to let the Warriors in, confident in his coming victory.",

However, before the Warlords can take Anubis to Talpa, the Ronin Warriors attack and engage them in battle. The Warriors hold off the Warlords, but Talpa blinds them temporarily with a bolt of energy, allowing the Warlords to escape with Anubis. The Warriors are more determined than ever to attack Talpa's castle and defeat him and the Ancient One agrees to become the bridge to the castle, but worries about the power of the Dark Side within. In the castle, Anubis is brought before Talpa and tries to no avail to convince the other Warlords of the truth and is thrown in the dungeon. The Warlords ask for the power of the Dark Side to make them stronger so they can defeat the Warriors, but Talpa reveals the source is pure evil and demands they prove themselves ready for the power. As the Warriors discuss the upcoming attack on the castle and Ryo's fears about what the Ancient One told them about their armor, the Ancient One summons Talpa and does battle with him. The Ancient One is no match for Talpa and is destroyed, but as his last act he turns himself into a bridge to Talpa's castle. The Warriors hear the commotion and are saddened when they realize the Ancient One's sacrifice, but prepare themselves to make use of it to finally assault Talpa's castle. At the same time, Talpa is aware of what the Ancient One planned and is amused, planning to let the Warriors in, confident in his coming victory.",
        "The Ronin Warriors, Ully and Mia meet with the Ancient One in a park. The Ancient One commends the Ronin Warriors for all of the good they have done so far and Mia for helping to bring the Warriors together. The Ancient One confirms that the Ronin and Warlord armors do share the same origin and that they can be bent to either good or evil. According to the Ancient One, Talpa knows that the armors can be used to destroy him and will be working to bend the Warriors armors to evil and Talpa can bend the Ronin armor to his will if goodness isn't in the Ronins hearts and souls. Anubis awakens and the Ancient One stops the Warriors from attacking him so he can talk to him and try to convince him to change sides. By this point, Anubis has seen enough that he understands that Talpa is only using him for his armor and the Ancient One explains that the nine armors were once all one and are formed out of human emotions. Anubis' virtue is Loyalty which means he is loyal to whoever is his master, but the Ancient One points out that Anubis can choose his own master. The Ancient One walks away after telling Anubis to no longer be controlled by Talpa (which he has been for over a thousand years) and to pick his own path and follow it. Realizing Anubis is lost to him, Talpa sends all three Dark Warlords to attack Anubis and retrieve his armor. By the time they arrive, Anubis has come to the conclusion that the Ancient One is right and fights back against them but is easily defeated.

Talpa sends the Nether Spirits to destroy the bridge and the Warriors and collect their armor and they nearly succeed, but the spirit of the Ancient One is able to channel the bridge's energy and destroy the spirits. Upon arrival at the castle, the Warriors are attacked by Dynasty soldiers and after fighting for a while, summon their armor and Rowen destroys them with Arrow Shockwave. However, when Ryo tries to use Flare Up Now against the castle, it just rebounds on him. Talpa then sends the Dark Warlords, now with increased power from the Nether Spirits to attack the Warriors. Their attacks easily overpower the Warriors and the Warlords warn them not to go on or face destruction, but the Warriors decide to push on anyways. Entering the castle, they end up separated and Sage is confronted by Cale, Ryo and Cye by Sekhmet and Rowen and Kento by Dais. Cye and Kento go up against Sekhmet and Dais one on one to allow Ryo and Rowen to go confront Talpa and the two meet up and finally confront Talpa face to face and demand answers. Talpa explains that as his Nether World grows bigger he needs the Earth as his world feeds off the anger and hatred in humans. He explains that just with the humans from Toyama he is able to create an unending army of Nether Spirits and Dynasty soldiers to take over the world. Ryo and Rowen attack Talpa to no avail with both of their attacks being deflected back at them and Ryo even getting blown outside the castle. Meanwhile, as the other Ronin fight their opponents, Anubis, still trapped in the castle dungeon, tells them to hold on as he will help them thanks to the Ancient One freeing him from Talpa's evil.",

        "Ryo is attacked and killed by Talpa, but is relieved when he wakes up and realizes that it was just a nightmare. He watches as Cye and Kento practice their moves while they rest at a house on a lakeside. Meanwhile, Sage and Rowen visit the city where everything has returned to normal with no one but them remembering what happened during Talpa's reign of terror. Despite the peace, the Ronin Warriors worry about threats from other parts of the Dynasty than just the now-dead Talpa and about Ryo's new armor. At the gates to the Nether World, a new threat, Saranbo appears, announcing his intention to destroy the world and steal the Ronin armors for himself to become invincible. Ryo finds Mia researching his armor and she explains that her grandfather was aware of the armors special powers and that the white armor he had summoned is called the Inferno armor. However, she is worried about Ryo as it takes a lot out of him to use and she believes he should rest. Ryo feels fine after sleeping a lot and and believes he is okay now. After having stopped to get a drink, a gate to the Nether World appears in front of Rowen and Sage and Saranbo arrives to attack them. Saranbo proves to be more than a match for them and demands to know which of them holds the Inferno armor and leaves after blasting them and discovering that neither holds it. They inform Cye, Kento and Mia about this but don't tell Ryo as he is still exhausted from his fight with Talpa and needs more time to recover. Deciding to keep it from Ryo and protect him, they lure Saranbo into a trap, but he is unscathed by even the combined power of Arrow Shockwave and Thunder Bolt Cut and easily defeats them. Upon learning that none of them possess the armor, he goes in search of Ryo leaving the others captured. Saranbo finds Ryo and tells him he has captured his friends and demands he find them. Ryo and White Blaze head out in search of the others and upon finding them, come under attack by Saranbo. Ryo loses until the Inferno Armor forms around him and he blasts Saranbo with Flare Up Now, apparently destroying him. However, Saranbo survives and is pleased to learn that he was right that Ryo is the wielder of the Inferno armor. After the battle, Mia arrives to find Ryo who returns to his normal Wildfire armor and collapses.",

Realizing that Ryo is weak and not using the full power of the armor, Saranbo decides to use this to his advantage. At Mia's house as everyone else relaxes, Ryo is worried about the threat he knows is not over and eventually leaves, breaking the good mood. Mia follows Ryo and tries to comfort him, knowing he blames himself for his friends getting hurt, but it fails and he sends her away shortly before he is attacked by Dynasty soldiers.

However, they come under attack from Dynasty soldiers. Meanwhile, Saranbo uses the Dark Flame to try to incinerate Ryo, but the other Ronin armors protect him from the flame at the expense of hurting their wearers.

        "A Dynasty warrior arrives on Earth, landing in a volcano named Mount Aso. The volcano erupts at his arrival, but the warlord uses black ice to calm it. At the same time, Ully, Mia, White Blaze and Ryo visit another volcano in an attempt to fix the Swords of Wildfire. The power of the volcano successfully repairs the swords and the group heads back home, but Ryo senses the nearby presence of the warrior, though he dismisses it. On the ride home, Ully encourages Mia to race White Blaze who seems to be back to normal after being restored by Black Blaze, the power of whom he now carries inside. At home, the Warriors see a news report about the eruption of Mount Aso and the ice that now covers it and decide to investigate. On the road, the warrior appears and Ryo engages in a battle with him, but proves to be no match for him. The warrior proves to be more than a match for all of the Warriors together and nearly kills Ryo before White Blaze knocks him away, knocking off his cloak. The warrior introduces himself as Sun Devil and explains that he was sent by his master to test their armors limits, but refuses to identify that master. Sun Devil splits into five copies which easily overpower the Warriors, but White Blaze attacks the one fighting Ryo and transforms into Black Blaze who has become a part of him ever since he saved White Blaze. At the insistence of the others, Ryo forms the Inferno Armor even though it will drain their power. Sun Devil explains he just wanted to see the power of the Inferno and freezes the Ronins in black ice, but Ryo breaks free and destroys Sun Devil with Rage of Inferno and the Soul Swords. A gateway to the Nether Realm appears and Sun Devil's master speaks to the Ronins through it, revealing himself to be the still-alive Talpa who is determined to have the Ronin armor return to him.",

        "Wanting to redeem himself for his past failures, Sekhmet approaches Talpa with a plan to defeat the Warriors and get their armor. He creates an evil clone of Cye with the same armor, but red and more powerful. This clone will be powerful enough to defeat the Warriors. Talpa is worried that they will be defeated again because of their reliance on the art of fighting battles, but Sekhmet is confident that he has accounted for that problem. Meanwhile, Ryo worries about being able to control the intense power created by the combination of the Soul Swords and the Armor of Inferno while everyone else worries about it as well as the fact that the Dynasty nearly overpowered them with its evil. That night, Ryo dreams that he tests his strength by using Flare Up Now to cut a massive boulder in half which works, but the Ancient One's spirit appears to tell him that strength alone isn't enough to defeat Talpa and the forces of evil, he must also fight the battle with his heart. He then appears in the dreams of all the other Warriors to give them advice and the next day, Kento believes that they need to find their center to find the balance the Ancient One was talking about and they take off to do so. Cye travels to the ocean, but is attacked by Dynasty soldiers. After defeating them, he comes face to face with his evil clone, Red Torrent and proves to be no match for him, forced to take the battle out of the water due to Red Torrent possessing Sekhmet's poison which starts affecting the ocean and being overpowered by Red Torrent's Super Wave Smasher when they fire at each other. The Ancient One's spirit appears again and tells Cye to ignore the turmoil and strength of his foe and find the peace in the battle. Cye realizes this is like how a whale let a powerful current carry him. The Ancient One tells him not to fight, but to swim into the stream of its nature and Cye clears his mind and searches for a solution. Red Torrent shoots his poisonous Super Wave Smasher and Cye decides to absorb the attack and use his armor to purify the water. The effort works and Cye, his power strengthened, blasts Red Torrent with his own Super Wave Smasher, destroying Red Torrent. However, a wave of poison emerges from Red Torrent's remains and Cye's attempt to stop it fails and he is overwhelmed by the attack and passes out. Sekhmet reveals himself and captures Cye, taking him through a gate to the Nether World.",

        "The Ancient One's spirit tells Sage to rely on mind, skill and spirit and not just the strength of his armor to overcome evil, saying that harnessing those three things will allow him to attain an even greater strength. In order to do so, Sage returns to the caves at the Catasota Gulch Pinnacles where the Armor of Halo was created and the source of its power. At the Pinnacles, Sage saves a deer from a pack of wolves who run away when he starts glowing. The deer and its herd, also fearing Sage, run away from him. Meanwhile, Talpa summons Cale and sends him to go after Sage to try to turn him to the side of evil, believing that once the Ronin Warriors see their true power, they will switch sides. Cale approaches Sage and explains that the wolves and the deer ran from him because they sensed the evil of his armor and fear it. Cale claims that the armors purpose is to bring destruction to the world and attacks. Cale battles Sage, trying to convince him of the armors evil power and for Sage to turn to evil, telling him that the armor makes him continually fight and destroy. Fearing this might be true, Sage powers down his armor and runs, hiding in a waterfall and meditating. In order to show Sage how cold and dark the heart of a Dynasty warlord is, Cale covers everything, including all living creatures in ice and snow, freezing Sage in the waterfall and tries to convince him to help destroy the world. In an attempt to drive Sage to evil, Cale revives and controls five deer and makes them attack Sage, trying to force him to kill them and drive him further from good, but when it fails, Cale kills them again. Sage summons his armor to fight Cale again, understanding that while his strength may come from the Dynasty, he still controls it with his mind. Sage unleashes the Thunder Bolt Cut, defeating Cale, but blasting off the top of the caves. Cale tells Sage he has now become a Dynasty warrior before collapsing and not wanting to give into the evil in the armor, Sage separates it from him and cuts it in half with his sword. However, his sword channels the power of his own spirit and repairs the armor and realizing that this is not an evil power, Sage regains faith in his mind, skill and spirit to overcome evil. This causes life to be restored to the land. However, this leaves Sage vulnerable and Talpa opens a gate to the Nether Realm and captures Sage and the Armor of Halo.",

Dais reveals that he has a plan that Kento's brute strength will be no match against and asks for the help of the Twin Sand Strikers which Talpa agrees to as Dais has served him well in the past. As Kento dozes as he makes his journey, he remembers what the Ancient One's spirit told him in his dream: that while he is the strongest among the Ronin Warriors, one great force cannot ruin another and that he must use the spirit of the armor to push his way through the \"sands of deception\", telling him to know them and to \"see what is not there.\" At a construction site, Kento is confronted by Dais who he is shocked to see alive and is attacked by the Sand Strikers. Dais claims the Dynasty is unstoppable and while the Sand Strikers hold Kento down, sends a wrecking ball at him. Kento dodges and battles the Sand Strikers, apparently destroying them with the wrecking ball, but they survive and bring part of a building down on top of him. However, Dais prevents them from killing Kento, telling them he wants Kento to suffer and telling Kento to continue his quest, that he'll be waiting for him. The three then travel to a forest which they petrify to await Kento's arrival. Kento arrives and battles Dais, unleashing Iron Rock Crusher twice and causing the area to turn into a desert. Dais reminds Kento how he once revealed to him that the stronger he gets the stronger the hold of evil on him and tells him that the world will end up just like it if he insists on fighting. Kento battles the Sand Strikers again, but when he unleashes Iron Rock Crusher once more, they simply absorb the power and easily beat him and Dais leaves to tell Talpa of his victory. Kento wakes up and to confuse him, the Sand Strikers dash around so fast that it appears there are many of them. Remembering what the Ancient One told him, Kento taps into the spirit of the armor which he realizes is a part of the natural energy flowing through the Earth and is able to see where the Sand Strikers really are. Using this, Kento unleashes Iron Rock Crusher again and destroys the Sand Strikers. Kento finally understands that in order to use all of his armor's strength, he must focus all of its power. Dais shows up again and attacks, but after he reveals that Cye and Sage have been captured, Kento willingly follows him to the Nether Realm in an effort to rescue them.",

The three then travel to a forest which they petrify to await Kento's arrival. Kento arrives and battles Dais, unleashing Iron Rock Crusher twice and causing the area to turn into a desert.

        "Having already captured Cye and Sage, Talpa decides to send Dais to capture another Ronin and Dais picks Kento. Dais reveals that he has a plan that Kento's brute strength will be no match against and asks for the help of the Twin Sand Strikers which Talpa agrees to as Dais has served him well in the past. As Kento dozes as he makes his journey, he remembers what the Ancient One's spirit told him in his dream: that while he is the strongest among the Ronin Warriors, one great force cannot ruin another and that he must use the spirit of the armor to push his way through the \"sands of deception\", telling him to know them and to \"see what is not there.\" At a construction site, Kento is confronted by Dais who he is shocked to see alive and is attacked by the Sand Strikers. Dais claims the Dynasty is unstoppable and while the Sand Strikers hold Kento down, sends a wrecking ball at him. Kento dodges and battles the Sand Strikers, apparently destroying them with the wrecking ball, but they survive and bring part of a building down on top of him.

Meanwhile, the Dark Warlords worry about being confronted by Ryo and Rowen with the power of the Inferno Armor and beg Talpa to destroy them and end it. Talpa summons Badamon, Lord of the Nether Spirits to explain the story behind the Inferno. Badamon explains that it came to be when the world was plagued by evil a long time ago. The five Ronin armors combined together to form the Inferno and it was worn by the first Ronin Warrior, Hariel. Ryo and Rowen continue battling Dala who taunts them about the fact that Ryo refuses to summon the Inferno to fight because it might drain their friends of the last of their energy and kill them. Badamon continues his explanation, telling the Warlords that the Inferno defeated the evil force plaguing the world long ago and that what they have seen is just the beginning of the Inferno's power, that nothing can stop it and even he doesn't know the full power of the Inferno, but that it is rumored that at full power it could destroy the world and leave behind a void. Talpa explains that he wants to conqur the armor for just that purpose, to build a new world under his control. Badamon plans to be the one to control the armor which he claims he can do with just a bit more time. Rowen rides off on a horse, leaving Ryo to battle Dala on his own, telling him to summon the Inferno. Ryo refuses to take that risk and continues to battle Dala on his power alone, trying and failing to use Flare Up Now on Dala. With the power of the three armors in his sword, Dala is able to use Cye, Kento and Sage's attacks against Ryo, blasting him down. Badamon explains to the Warlords that he and his spirits can control the Inferno Armor where the Warlords would be destroyed and he has take control of the armor. Rowen blasts the roof off of the other Ronin Warriors prison with his Arrow Shockwave as a signal and they send their armor power to Ryo who forms the Inferno.

Ryo and Rowen continue battling Dala who taunts them about the fact that Ryo refuses to summon the Inferno to fight because it might drain their friends of the last of their energy and kill them. Badamon continues his explanation, telling the Warlords that the Inferno defeated the evil force plaguing the world long ago and that what they have seen is just the beginning of the Inferno's power, that nothing can stop it and even he doesn't know the full power of the Inferno, but that it is rumored that at full power it could destroy the world and leave behind a void. Talpa explains that he wants to conqur the armor for just that purpose, to build a new world under his control. Badamon plans to be the one to control the armor which he claims he can do with just a bit more time. Rowen rides off on a horse, leaving Ryo to battle Dala on his own, telling him to summon the Inferno. Ryo refuses to take that risk and continues to battle Dala on his power alone, trying and failing to use Flare Up Now on Dala. With the power of the three armors in his sword, Dala is able to use Cye, Kento and Sage's attacks against Ryo, blasting him down. Badamon explains to the Warlords that he and his spirits can control the Inferno Armor where the Warlords would be destroyed and he has take control of the armor. Rowen blasts the roof off of the other Ronin Warriors prison with his Arrow Shockwave as a signal and they send their armor power to Ryo who forms the Inferno. Ryo destroys Dala and his sword with Rage of Inferno and in his normal armor, helps Rowen defeat the Dynasty soldiers he is fighting.

Meanwhile, Ryo and Rowen try to make their way through a maze to Talpa's castle. Badamon reports to Talpa a plan to take control of the Inferno armor: transfer the evil power of the Dark Warlords armors to Ryo which would then overwhelm him then make him summon the Inferno.

Rowen is unable to stop it and Ryo is completely drained while the effects are seen in the mortal world as Talpa's castle flickering in and out of view, causing Anubis to say that the Dynasty is rising again. While wondering what to do, both the staff and the Jewel of Life glow again and Anubis finally understands what he has to do to help the others. As Ryo is unconscious and completely drained, Rowen holds off Lady Kayura while sending White Blaze to carry Ryo to safety. Rowen battles Lady Kayura but is no match for her, getting blasted so high into the air at one point that he nearly falls to his death before his armor saves him. At the same time, Anubis uses both the Jewel of Life and the Ancient One's staff to carry him, Mia and Ully to Ryo and Rowen to help them out. During his fight with Lady Kayura, Rowen spots White Blaze carry Ryo onto a barge and take off and he lands on the barge to protect them but is defeated. However, as Anubis, Mia and Ully approach, the power of the Jewel of Life causes a water spout that knocks Lady Kayura off the barge and forces her back ashore.

Meanwhile, Talpa speaks with Badamon who has prepared altars for the nine armors and has been having his Nether Spirits \"purify\" the bodies of the Dark Warlords who Talpa only sees as useful tools. Anubis and White Blaze successfully protect Mia and Ully from Dynasty soldiers while Ryo and Rowen battle against more soldiers and Lady Kayura with little luck.

Ryo agrees and leaves Anubis to continue the fight. Dynasty soldiers attack Mia and Ully, but the Jewel of Life protects them and kills the soldiers. Knowing that the Jewel is a mystical artifact that poses a threat to the Dynasty and not wanting to risk Mia and Ully uncovering its powers, Badamon suggests they do something about it, but Talpa isn't worried, believing that the Ronins and their allies have no way of using the three mystical artifacts that could spell doom for the Dynasty: the Inferno Armor, the Soul Swords of Fervor and the Jewel. Anubis is able to hold his own against Lady Kayura with the Ancient One's staff protecting him, however, to his surprise, the staff will not strike down Lady Kayura for some reason. Rowen is dropped into a cavern where its revealed he faked his death and he finds the other Ronin Warriors completely drained of power which has turned them into statues.

However, the Dark Warlords demand to fight them instead and when Ryo, Cye and Kento charge them, drop them through trap doors to separate them and head off to face them, leaving Sage and Rowen to face Lady Kayura. Ryo, Sage and Cye land in a pit which is filled with water, but Cye manages to find an exit which he blasts open, dropping the three into a chasm. While Ryo and Kento manage to hang onto the side of the chasm, Cye falls in and later Dais and Sekhmet knock Kento and Ryo in. Sage and Rowen battle Lady Kayura, targeting her amulet while trying to protect Ully and Mia at the same time from Dynasty soldiers when the Jewel of Life doesn't seem to be doing anything. Cale confronts Cye in the chasm, using the darkness there to his advantage as Cye can't see where he is while Cale can see him and attack. At the same time, Kento faces Dais who grows to a giant size to fight him which doesn't seem to be an illusion while Ryo faces Sekhmet who traps Ryo in a sea of acidic venom which will slowly eat away at his armor and then his body. Anubis, who is nearby, is confused when the Ancient One's staff glows and remembers how it wouldn't let him harm Lady Kayura and how she disappeared after it didn't. Anubis realizes that it might be a sign that Ryo is in trouble and heads off to help him while Sage and Rowen continue to protect Mia and Ully, but are outnumbered. Just in time, Anubis reaches Ryo and rescues him from the poison with the staff and drives Sekhmet away. As Kento is about to be killed by the giant Dais, Anubis causes Dais disappear using the staff and Ryo is able to convince Kento that Anubis is now on their side and they head off together.

Realizing that the Ancient One's will is that he fight in his armor again, he puts the helmet on and dons his old armor and launches Quake With Fear at Lady Kayura.",
        "The Ronin Warriors, having found a somewhat safe place, rest and practice for the upcoming fight with Talpa while Anubis meditates. When they leave, Mia and Ully stay behind and Anubis decides to as well as he isn't sure of what the Ancient One's will for him now is. The Warriors reluctantly accept this, but warn Anubis that they won't hold back on Lady Kayura if they encounter her as she fights with Talpa. Meanwhile, Lady Kayura sits in her room and flashes back on her life which she is able to do as her amulet is cracked. She remembers that she is the last remaining member of the Ancient One's people who has great supernatural powers as a result. Lady Kayura takes her amulet off again and resists the evil, worrying Badamon and Talpa as without Lady Kayura he doesn't have the power of the Ancient One's clan on his side when the shrines he's building for the nine armors are complete, saying that his plan to unite the Dynasty and mortal world under his control is impossible without her help. However, Badamon proposes letting her regain her memories and then having him possess her mind and soul so she will be completely under their control, but they know they need to keep Anubis away for the plan to work so Talpa sends the Dark Warlords to deal with him. The Warriors battle an army of Dynasty soldiers and armor up to deal with them, which they easily do, but are confused by the fact that no stronger enemies appear to fight like Lady Kayura or the Dark Warlords. Badamon goes to Lady Kayura and successfully possesses her to do the Dynasty will while Anubis senses that something has happened to her and realizing that she is the last of the Ancient One's clan, becomes determined to save her like the Ancient One saved him. The Dark Warlords attack and Anubis is forced to fight them briefly until he uses the Ancient One's staff to split the land and send them away. As the Warriors defeat the Dynasty soldiers, Lady Kayura arrives atop a Dynasty energy ball and Sage and Cye's attacks have absolutely no effect against it so they form the Inferno Armor. However, the Inferno has no effect against the energy ball and it crashes into Ryo and detonates, dispelling the Inferno and knocking the Ronin Warriors out. As Lady Kayura is about to capture them, Anubis arrives to try to save her from Badamon, but is confronted by the Dark Warlords. However, the Ancient One's staff levitates and gives Anubis back his helmet from his old armor of Cruelty. Realizing that the Ancient One's will is that he fight in his armor again, he puts the helmet on and dons his old armor and launches Quake With Fear at Lady Kayura."

        "Anubis launches Quake With Fear at Lady Kayura and the Dark Warlords, tying them up and tries to reach the real Lady Kayura, however Badamon, controling Lady Kayura, tells him that his hold on her is unbreakble and breaks free of the chains and charges at Anubis. Meanwhile, Nether Spirits arrives on barges with one each coming from one of nine nearby towers and each take one of the Ronin Warriors to one of the towers. The possessed Lady Kayura tries to convince Anubis to surrender while Anubis tries to convince the Dark Warlords that they are just being used which Lady Kayura proves by trapping them in spheres of energy. Badamon explains that the nine armors forever link the mortal realm and the Nether World which has always been the Warlords purpose. Mia confirms this, saying that there is an old legend that mentions nine keys which she realizes means the nine armors and warns that the whole world could possibly be destroyed as a result of this. Lady Kayura sends the Warlords up to more barges and battles Anubis who's Quake With Fear has little effect on her. Lady Kayura defeats Anubis and captures him too then goes after Ully and the Jewel of Life. Talpa cheers his victory in capturing the nine armors and how he will use them to complete his plan. Lady Kayura chases Ully, Mia and White Blaze nearly getting the Jewel of Life before White Blaze retrieves it from her. Mia realizes that the Jewel still has the power to defeat Talpa which is why she wants it so badly and confirming this, she attacks again. Meanwhile, Anubis prays to the Ancient One for strength and manages to break Badamon's spell freezing him and sends his armor from his body, causing the Ancient One's staff to reappear and drive away the Nether Spirits holding him prisoner. Anubis saves Mia as Lady Kayura is about to kill her and summons his armor again. Lady Kayura attacks him with Star Sword Scream which he absorbs then launches Quake With Fear which is charged with the energy of Lady Kayura's attack at her. Anubis then jumps up and holds Lady Kayura in place as the attack strikes, fatally wounding him and he sends his armor to Lady Kayura. The combination of the attack and the armor drives Badamon from Lady Kayura's body, finally freeing her from the influence of evil and Anubis collapses into a river, dead, but pleased that he has succeeded. Talpa is furious with Badamon for his failure and tells him to prepare to use the remaining armor to open a gateway to the mortal world. However, Badamon warns that if they miss the opportunity caused by the eclipse of the sun in the mortal world, not even the power of the armors will be enough to try again. Lady Kayura leads Mia, Ully and White Blaze to a barge that will lead them to safety and Mia explains to her what has occurred.

Xactions are very powerful, and useful, but sometimes prove difficult to troubleshoot because of the low-level way they interact with parts of the BA server. Developers are starting to use Pentaho Data Integration transformation files to carry out automation and business logic tasks. The transformations can be run directly by the BA Server and visually debugged in Pentaho Data Integration (PDI) and are quickly gaining favor in the community over xactions. It is a small leap to imagine PDI transformations will eventually replace xactions entirely."
