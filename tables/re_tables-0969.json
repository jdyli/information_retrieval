One of the attractions is a duel computer that allows novices to refine their duelling skills. However, an enigmatic hacker locks all the guests in and sets the difficulty to Expert, leaving the amateur duelist Rick facing an immensely difficult task. Yugi duels instead, but he uses Rick's deck: full of Dragons and next-to-no magic and trap cards!"

Yugi was finally able to defeat the \"Dark Magician\" with his \"Silent Magician.\" Atem tries to activate the Spell card Monster Reborn so he can revive Slifer the Sky Dragon, but when Yugi opens the Gold Sarcophagus to reveal the card he sealed, the card was \"Monster Reborn\". It means neither of them can use that card in this game. It is Yugi's message to the other Yugi that \"Those of the dead should not remain in the world of the living.\" Yugi finally defeats Atem, but immediately collapses on his knees, crying. Despite Atem telling him that Yugi shouldn't cry, Yugi tells Atem that he (Yugi) is a coward, and that Atem was always his goal. Atem comforts Yugi, that he isn't a coward, and Yugi's victory has finally set him free. Atem then departs into the afterlife, while Yugi and his friends begin a new journey. Then, the Millennium Stone shatters, which causes the seven Millennium Items to fall into the pit left behind. Also, the shrine collapses, and Shadi's spirit is seen here one last time. Everybody barely makes it out in time. As a result of the shrine's destruction, the Millennium Items are buried forever. Then, Yugi tells Joey that, \"sometimes, the end of one adventure is only beginning of another.\" This concludes the end of the 4-Kids version of the story. In the extended ending (only in the Original Japanese version), Yugi, Tea, Joey, Tristan, Duke, Grandpa, Kaiba and Mokuba all leave Egypt and return to Domino City, in Japan. In the airport, they meet up with Rebecca and Serenity. Both Duke and Tristan fall for Serenity but are pulled back by Joey. Rebecca hugs Yugi much to Tea's annoyance. Weevil Underwood and Rex Raptor get into an argument again and decide to duel. Zigfried and Leon von Schroeder make a business proposition with Pegasus, which turns to their favor. Mako Tsunami sets sail from their fishing trip to be met up with Espa Roba at the harbor. Mai Valentine and Vivian Wong are facing a two-on-two duel against the Paradox Brothers atop the Great Wall of China. The credits end with a cutscene where Grandpa is sweeping, while Yugi comes out from the house to join Tea, Joey, and Tristan to go to school. Yugi ends the show by saying that his story has not ended, and that his story is not about a pharaoh who after 5,000 years defeated the evil Zorc Necrophades. \"This isn't the legend of a Pharaoh. Everybody has his own story....The story that completes in the light. My story has just started.\" \u2014Yugi Muto (Note: In fact, Yugi says that his own story was just beginning. This alludes to the famous phrase: \"This isn't the legend of a Pharaoh. Everybody has his own story....The story that completes in the light. My story has just started.\" \u2014FIN)",
        "Yugi tries his best to fend off the attacks from Atem's most powerful trump card, the \"Dark Magician.\" Yugi then plays his Spell Card, \"Gold Sarcophagus.\" The power of the Gold Sarcophagus is it can negate the effects of another magic card that is stored in the chest.
