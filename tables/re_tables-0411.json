Things look good for Sav until he finds out that his little sister Alli is coming on the trip with them. At first, Alli won't keep away from him and Anya, but eventually she starts seeking after Johnny. Now Sav is too worried about what Alli is doing behind his back to express any interest toward Anya. When he tells Alli off for getting close to guys like Johnny, Anya refuses to tolerate his double standard any longer and breaks up with him, leaving him heartbroken. Meanwhile, Emma and Manny are both crushing on their roommate Kelly. They know they are too mature to do this again, but they can't help but be interested in who he likes. When Emma has had enough, she rushes into Kelly's room, only to find him in bed with Gwenith. He later tells an embarrassed Emma and Manny that he is not going to date his roommates, which they reluctantly accept.",

Things look good for Sav until he finds out that his little sister Alli is coming on the trip with them. At first, Alli won't keep away from him and Anya, but eventually she starts seeking after Johnny. Now Sav is too worried about what Alli is doing behind his back to express any interest toward Anya.

She dances with Blue and finally informs him of her financial difficulties, which is why she didn't go to the concert with him. He calls her \"Holly\" and they continue to dance, Holly J. smiling in his arms. Clare and K.C begin to fight because he thinks she looks down on him because of his upbringing. Connor makes numerous attempts to get them to make up but it only works when he locks them both in the janitor's closet where they finally reveal their true feelings for each other."

Despite issues at home, Ellie and Marco venture to L.A., as well, to visit Paige, who is now an assistant to an A-list reality TV star. Ellie then reunites with Craig, causing a reconnection between each other but bad timing and Ellie's guilt over avoiding her shellshocked father take their toll.

        "Following Ry\u016bji's rejection by Minori, Taiga visits a shrine while he has the flu and runs into Y\u016bsaku. Taiga decides not to come over to Ry\u016bji's house anymore and tells him not to give up on her. The teacher informs her students that the field trip to Okinawa is now going to be a ski trip due to their previously booked hotel burning down. Taiga points out to Ry\u016bji that this would be his last chance to confirm Minori's feelings before classes are rearranged. Ry\u016bji catches up with Minori, who is still a bit disheartened from Christmas, and Taiga provides an opportunity for the two to start talking again. Later, Ry\u016bji, Minori, Y\u016bsaku, Ami and the other students go to Taiga's apartment to discuss plans for the trip. Ry\u016bji and Minori talk in the kitchen, where she constantly praises Ry\u016bji for the way Taiga has become.
