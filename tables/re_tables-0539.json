        "Mandy takes you shopping for bras, and ends up dragging You into a changing room to give You a blow job. You and Mandy return to Your apartment to find Phil filming Sam dressed as a baby in front of a green screen, with green tape placed over his mouth so that he can substitute dialogue in later. Then You, Phil and Sam go to a local strip club, where Phil and Sam marvel at how delicious the food is. Jessica sends You a message inviting You to a game of kickball, to which You agree to come on the condition that she waits thirty minutes, as a dancer at the strip club has just offered You a private dance. At the kickball game, You first take part in a keg stand, and then play on the team opposing Jessica's. Upon kicking the ball, you almost make it to home plate before Jessica pegs your eye out. As she apologizes for hitting You in the face, and asks what she can do to make it up to You, the scene cuts to You having sex with Mandy. You obviously aren't paying any attention to her. Meanwhile Phil and Sam have decided to produce a commercial for the strip club, and ask You to get it from the apartment and bring it to the strip club. At the apartment, You take the time to stare at your Hot Neighbor practicing yoga stretches, before grabbing the DVD and taking it to the strip club. The commercial Phil and Sam produced turns out to focus more on the club's food than its dancers, and the owner dismisses all three of you with disgust. Mandy, deciding You have been unfaithful to her, tries to make you jealous by going up onto the stage and dancing in a stripper outfit. Phil tries to steal some of the club's food, only to be tackled to the ground, while Sam commandeers the DJ's box. Mandy also gets into a fight with the other stripper on stage. All of you are thrown out, while Mandy announces that You and her are back together because she \"saw the way You were looking at her\". A few days later, You, Sam and Phil send Jessica into the club to get food, and she races into the car announcing that the food there is great. Sam declares his approval of Jessica, and all four of you race off.",

Just then Chester pops in and challenges you to a game of paintball. Then Jess invites you to a party with Phil and Sam. Sam is afraid some girl will \"jerk him off\". Then Mandy shows up asking you to upload her audition video for the real world. You all go to the party, despite Sam's repulsion of women. You learn the \"Jerry Mcguire\"s Johnathan Lipnicki was invited. Phil remembers a back in high school when Lipniki stole his dream girl. Mandy tracks you down and tries to make you jelous with Lipniki. After you find Jessica you and Phil explain why Mandy mustn't know about you and her. Later Sam gets drunk and falls asleep on a bed where all the coats are kept. Jessica decides to leave to meet up with her boyfriend. After the party Everyone watches Sam have his first wet dream.(in the dream he is doing it with Mandy!)

        "Betty finds that everything is changing as she begins her new job as associate features editor, especially since her boss is her ex-boyfriend, Matt Hartley, who is still unhappy about their breakup. In addition, Betty's new officemate Megan openly resents her, while Marc is constantly undermining her because he felt he was more deserving of the promotion. Meanwhile, without Betty as his assistant, Daniel is adrift, still mourning the loss of his wife, Molly. Justin starts high school and is victimized by bullies but won't tell his mom, Hilda. Claire Meade is finding that her power struggle at the company has her sitting pretty -- for the moment -- opposite Wilhelmina, who lost her claim to the Meade throne last season. But Wilhelmina has perhaps an even bigger problem than job security - she is harboring a secret at home that is driving Marc to distraction."

There, she discovers a new designer, Marisa, whom she promotes as one of the 10 Designers to Watch, but Marc steals all her thunder.
