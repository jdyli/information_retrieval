So Toya resigned, while most onlookers thought it was neck-and-neck. Sai finally realizes why he was brought back through Hikaru, finding his time on this world is about to end."

When Akira Tsubaki wakes up Urabe at the end of a school day, he finds her face enchanting and ends up sampling some of her drool. After having a dream about Urabe that he can't seem to get out of his head, Tsubaki suddenly comes down with fever. Urabe goes to Tsubaki's house and gives him more of her drool which cures his fever, explaining his symptoms were the result of withdrawal from not getting any more drool. As such, Urabe begins meeting up with Tsubaki every day to give him some more of her drool. As Tsubaki starts to fall in love with Urabe, he decides to confess to her after a few days. When asked by Urabe to profess his love in a way only he can, Tsubaki demonstrates it by ripping up a photo he had in his wallet of his middle school crush. After explaining the reason she laughed in class was because a voice told her Tsubaki would be the first person she would have sex with, Urabe agrees to become his girlfriend.",

        "As Ayuko goes to the festival with Kouhei, she spots Tsubaki with Aika and decides to follow them. As Tsubaki tries to hold off the advances of Aika, Urabe appears in a box robot, suggesting they do a blind taste test of each of their drool to see which Tsubaki prefers. Akira instantly gets a nosebleed from Urabe's drool, due to the fact that she was naked inside her costume. Aika gets naked and attempts to give Tsubaki her drool, but she stops when she starts crying, making it clear that her advances on Tsubaki were simply an attempt to get over losing her boyfriend, who had feelings for someone else even when he was dating her. Urabe tries some of Aika's drool, sensing she has long had unrequited love but assuring her she'll one day find the right someone. Just then, Tsubaki's blindfold gets shaken off and he sees the girls naked, prompting slaps from the both of them. As Tsubaki and Urabe leave together, she tells him that her eventual kiss with him will be her first, prompting a smile when she tries his drool."

        "Below the text, a man lies on a bed, facing outwards towards the reader. He seems to have lines of radiance emanating from his head. Several vines decorate the spaces all around the heading (\"Therefore\"). Another vine descends down the right margin near the third and fourth lines of text. On the left, the last letter of \"may\" extends into a small vine. Vines also surround the final word on the plate, \"is\", which is on a line on its own.",
        "From Copy G. Although there is no way of knowing if the man is living or dead, the motif of the beams of radiance suggest he may be Christ, and thus the \"God\" who \"becomes as/we are, that we/may be as he/is.\" Robert N. Essick believes the design perfectly reflects the text; \"the Word (Blake's text) becomes the flesh (branches, leaves, etc); the flesh becomes the Word.\""
