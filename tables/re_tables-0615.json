        "Sookie consoles Eric for the loss of Godric, which leads to the two becoming intimate. This turns out to be a dream which is the result of her having drunk Eric's blood. Sookie, Bill and Jason return to Bon Temps to find the town in chaos. They return to Bill's house to find Hoyt and Jessica tending to Maxine, who is under the effects of Maryann's power. Sam is hiding out with Andy Bellefleur, but he is tricked into coming to Merlotte's via a desperate call from Arlene. Once there, the townsfolk trap both of them in the walk-in fridge. Jason arrives at Merlotte's armed with power tools. He convinces all the citizens to leave by threatening to take Arlene hostage and shoot a nail-gun into her head. Jason goes to help Sam, but the townsfolk quickly recognize his deception and return to try to recapture Sam. Jason, wearing a gas mask, pretends to be the God Who Comes, while Andy holds up a tree branch to give him the appearance that he has horns.

Sam re-appears, and Jason and Andy are stunned at what happened. Meanwhile, Bill and Sookie go to Sookie's house to find Maryann, who attacks Sookie. Sookie learns that Maryann is the creature who attacked her in the woods. Bill attempts to bite Maryann but finds her blood is toxic to him. Maryann seems intrigued with Sookie, who puts her hand up to push Maryann away, and finds that a burst of light shines from her hand, knocking Maryann backwards. Sookie and Bill flee while Maryann gleefully ponders what Sookie is. They go to Lafayette's and see Tara is still under Maryanne's spell.

He goes to seek the vampire Queen of Louisiana, the one person who might know how to destroy Maryann, but when he arrives he finds a bloody foot dangling from the throne. Meanwhile, Maxine continues to insult both Jessica and Hoyt until Jessica's anger gets the better of her and she begins to feed on Maxine.",

        "In the season two finale, Maryann has decided to appoint Sookie as the \"Maid of Honor\" at her sacrificial ritual, much to Sookie's disgust. Maryann asks Sookie to repeat her \"electric\" touch, but Sookie fails to do so. She is restrained by an entranced Lafayette. Jason and Andy Bellefleur try to advance on the crowd with an arsenal of weaponry, only to become quickly entranced themselves. During Eric's meeting with Sophie-Ann, it is revealed that she's the one who ordered him to have Lafayette start dealing V again. She does not like the fact that Bill knows what Northman is doing, but Eric promises to take care of him before he can figure out that Sophie-Ann is in fact behind it all. Bill finds Sam at Merlotte's and orders him to come with him to see Maryann. Bill offers Sam to Maryann in exchange for Sookie's safety. Sookie strongly objects to this, but Bill asks her to trust him. Eggs stabs Sam and offers some of his blood to Maryann, who rubs the blood on her body. Sam has not died, however, and tells Sookie to destroy all of Maryann's ritual offerings, which Sookie does. This angers Maryann who pursues Sookie with her poisonous claws, but she is stopped by a bull whom she believes to be the God Who Comes. Offering herself to the \"God\", the bull stabs her in the chest with its horns, and as Maryann starts to die, the bull transforms back to Sam, who finishes the job by removing Maryann's heart. Bill reveals to Sookie that he allowed Sam to drink his blood so he could recover after being stabbed. Bill also thanks Sam for his trust and for helping save the town of Bon Temps. Hoyt learns that his mom was not lying about his dad having committed suicide. Deeply disturbed by this, he walks out on her again to go find Jessica. When he arrives at Bill's house, nobody is there. Jessica, after telling Bill she is going to apologize to Hoyt, instead goes to a gas station and feeds on an unsuspecting truck driver. Sam goes to visit his adopted parents. His adopted mother cries and still can't accept that Sam is a shapeshifter, while his adopted father who appears deathly ill writes a response to Sam's request, to know who his real parents were, despite his step-mother's warnings that they were bad people. Eggs is deeply disturbed by the recent happenings and begs Sookie to help him uncover his actions during his blackouts. With her help, he learns that he was the one who murdered Miss Jeanette, Daphne and was also the one who stabbed Sam. Incredibly distraught over the things he'd done with Maryann, he holds Andy Bellefleur at knife-point begging to be arrested. Andy tries to explain that all of his actions were not of his own free will, but Jason, seeing the hold-up from afar, does not realize what is happening and shoots Eggs. Jason is afraid after realizing he has killed Eggs, but Andy takes his gun, wipes it off and tells Jason to leave and that \"he was not here and he didn't see anything.\" Tara arrives along with many others to see Eggs shot and dead, and she breaks down in tears. Bill takes Sookie out to a French restaurant and proposes to her. Sookie is initially confused and afraid because of all of the recent happenings in her life. Excusing herself to go to the bathroom, she takes a moment to compose herself and decides that she does want to marry Bill. However, Bill is captured with a silver chain and kidnapped. When she returns, she finds that Bill is gone and the place is in disarray.",
        "In the season two finale, Maryann has decided to appoint Sookie as the \"Maid of Honor\" at her sacrificial ritual, much to Sookie's disgust. Maryann asks Sookie to repeat her \"electric\" touch, but Sookie fails to do so. She is restrained by an entranced Lafayette. Jason and Andy Bellefleur try to advance on the crowd with an arsenal of weaponry, only to become quickly entranced themselves. During Eric's meeting with Sophie-Ann, it is revealed that she's the one who ordered him to have Lafayette start dealing V again. She does not like the fact that Bill knows what Northman is doing, but Eric promises to take care of him before he can figure out that Sophie-Ann is in fact behind it all. Bill finds Sam at Merlotte's and orders him to come with him to see Maryann. Bill offers Sam to Maryann in exchange for Sookie's safety. Sookie strongly objects to this, but Bill asks her to trust him. Eggs stabs Sam and offers some of his blood to Maryann, who rubs the blood on her body. Sam has not died, however, and tells Sookie to destroy all of Maryann's ritual offerings, which Sookie does. This angers Maryann who pursues Sookie with her poisonous claws, but she is stopped by a bull whom she believes to be the God Who Comes. Offering herself to the \"God\", the bull stabs her in the chest with its horns, and as Maryann starts to die, the bull transforms back to Sam, who finishes the job by removing Maryann's heart. Bill reveals to Sookie that he allowed Sam to drink his blood so he could recover after being stabbed. Bill also thanks Sam for his trust and for helping save the town of Bon Temps. Hoyt learns that his mom was not lying about his dad having committed suicide. Deeply disturbed by this, he walks out on her again to go find Jessica. When he arrives at Bill's house, nobody is there. Jessica, after telling Bill she is going to apologize to Hoyt, instead goes to a gas station and feeds on an unsuspecting truck driver. Sam goes to visit his adopted parents. His adopted mother cries and still can't accept that Sam is a shapeshifter, while his adopted father who appears deathly ill writes a response to Sam's request, to know who his real parents were, despite his step-mother's warnings that they were bad people. Eggs is deeply disturbed by the recent happenings and begs Sookie to help him uncover his actions during his blackouts. With her help, he learns that he was the one who murdered Miss Jeanette, Daphne and was also the one who stabbed Sam. Incredibly distraught over the things he'd done with Maryann, he holds Andy Bellefleur at knife-point begging to be arrested. Andy tries to explain that all of his actions were not of his own free will, but Jason, seeing the hold-up from afar, does not realize what is happening and shoots Eggs.

Hohenheim leaves the next day, warning Pinako that something horrible will happen in this country. Alphonse explains to Ling the circumstances of his body, and Winry is appalled when Ling doesn't care about the consequences of Alphonse's body. Determined to find the true answer, Edward and Pinako dig up the corpse of the failed transmutation during a downpour, though Edward keeps retching at the thought. When the body has been unearthed, he realizes it was not their mother that they transmuted. Edward then calls Izumi and asks about the legitimacy of her human transmutation, but she does not answer. Edward returns to Central and reunites with Alphonse and Winry, reassuring them of the possibility of restoring Alphonse's body. Izumi calls Edward back, saying she had the same results as him, which confirms his suspicions of the possibility, but not of reviving what has been deceased.

Winry and Miles arrive, and Winry confronts Scar face-to-face about the deaths of her parents. Explosions then are set off, and it appears that Scar has taken Winry hostage. Meanwhile, as Olivier's squad retrieve the survivors from the tunnels, Briggs Fortress is approached by Central Command Headquarters."

Miles explains to Scar that he joined the military to gradually change the way people think of Ishvalans. Since May and Marcoh need Scar to decipher his brother's research, Miles offers to hide everyone at the fort, with Alphonse insisting on sparing the two chimeras.

May passes through Youswell, and the people there offer to help her on her journey back to Xing, but Envy tricks her into heading back to Central. Edward, Darius, and Heinkel arrive at one of the old hideouts in Central and are soon met by Ling, who had managed to temporarily regain control over his body. Before Greed takes over again, Ling tells Edward that Father will try to open the gate on the Promised Day. Since Greed had severed his relationships with the homunculi, Edward suggests that Greed become his ally. Greed jokes that he just might consider it if they work for him, but Edward decides to take that suggestion seriously, and Greed accepts the offer. Alphonse passes a message to all military command headquarters, warning everyone about the Promised Day, which is set to take place next spring."

Before Mustang can kill Envy, it is then that Edward, Hawkeye, and Scar persuade him to let go of his anger and his need for revenge, for Amestris cannot be ruled by someone consumed with hatred. Envy becomes outraged by Mustang's change of heart and rants about why everyone does not kill each other, trying to goad them into doing so by pointing out all of the terrible things they have done to each other. Edward determines that the reason why Envy hates humans is because he is jealous of their capacity to continue living on, despite all the abuse they take. Humiliated and insulted by how Edward understands him, Envy commits suicide by tearing out and destroying his own philosopher's stone. Meanwhile, the Armstrong siblings begin to gain the upper hand in their battle against Sloth.
