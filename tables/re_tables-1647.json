        "When Alex screws up on several WOOHP missions, she begins to seriously doubt her spying abilities. Then, when Jerry introduces the girls to Britney \u2013 a pretty, smart, sweet, spy-in-training who's been assigned to help them on their next mission \u2013 Alex only feels worse. In fact, she thinks she\u2019s on the verge of being replaced. When she screws up again and lets a villain (who's invented a device that literally slows people down) escape, she decides to quit WOOHP altogether. In a b-story, Alex does an extra credit project for science class (about molecules) that helps her stop the bad guy, save her girlfriends and gain her confidence back. Villain: Willard."

Former Bishop Gerrard High School (for girls) merged into Bishop Connolly c. 1982, making Bishop Connolly one of the nation's first co-educational Jesuit high schools. (Bishop Gerrard, operated on the campus of the former Mount Saint Mary Academy [Religious Sisters of Mercy], was itself the product of a c. 1973 merger between that school, the former Jesus Mary Academy [Religious of Jesus and Mary], Sacred Hearts Academy [Holy Union Sisters of the Sacred Hearts] and the high school of Dominican Academy [Dominican Sisters of the Presentation].) Former Msgr. Prevost High School (Brothers of Christian Instruction) moved to Bishop Connolly building in 1968 and merged into Bishop Connolly in 1972."

Every winter she returned to Van Lent for maintenance and refit work. In the early 1980s she was bought by Van Lent for the personal use of John van Lent. After he died in she was sold to Britisih ownership and her name was changed to \"Lenten Rose\" and a very boxy Pillthouse was added. she was bought by Lord Normanton of offshore powerbaot racing fame, who changed her name to \"Alto Volante\". She spent the next few years cruising in the Mediterranean. In 2004 she was found languishing in Majorca by london resident David Japp, who brought her to the UK for a total rebuild including fitting newly rebuilt GARDNER 6LXB engines, new wiring and plumbing, air con and all new services, bow thruster, stabilisers, new interior, new deck and a more appropriately shaped Pilothouse. She is due to return to the Mediterranean in early 2014. Her name has been changed back to \" Tiky\"",

Worse still, the spies never recognized her, and she managed to lure them into her trap. As soon as they put the bracelets on their wrists, the spies suddenly pass out. When they wake up at long last, they forget everything about being spies at WHOOP, believing they are ordinary girls. Jerry goes into a fashion store, only to be captured by L.A.M.O.S., and trapped in their submarine. He hears about their evil plan, and tries to warn the girls.

        "The spies arrive at an inventor's lab stealing a special \"spy gene formula.\" On their way back to WOOHP, they drop the vial called SUDS, accidentally spilling it into Mandy's pool where she, Caitlin and Dominique are swimming, making them into spy-assassins or exterminators. Meanwhile, after returning to Beverly Hills and sent to WOOHP with the spies, the spies' mothers discover that their daughters are spies, shutting down their spy careers. Jerry tells the spies they got the spy gene and the spies and Jerry say goodbye. Mandy and her cronies attempt to attack the spies, but they manage to escape. Later that night, the spies sneak to Mandy's house and find the SUDS, now half-empty. The spies overhear Mandy and her cronies saying soon it's time for retaliation. After being caught by their mothers, forced to return and forbidden to see each other, Sam analyzes the SUDS and finds out all. In retaliation, Mandy and her cronies kidnap their mothers. The spies discover Mandy and her cronies took their mothers to Mandy's chalet at Sugarflake. After sending Jerry a letter, the spies arrive at Sugar flake and save their mothers. Later they fight with Mandy and her cronies. When Jerry arrives to help, the chopper creates an avalanche that covers the spies, Mandy and her cronies. Suddenly, the spies, Mandy and her cronies are alive. Mandy and her cronies finally kidnap the spies and take them to GROOVE. Mandy and her cronies discover all and turn the spies into spy-assassins.

At first somewhat resentful of Virgil Tibbs, he would later become very close to Virgil and the rest of the Tibbs family. It should be noted that their relationship in the TV series is much less adversarial than it is in the film version. For the first six seasons he was the chief of the Sparta Police Department until he was fired by the city council at the beginning of the 7th season. He would then become interim County Sheriff after the previous Sheriff became too ill to continue his duties. Gillespie would become the permanent Sheriff by the end of the series. Gillespie was married at one time to Anna, his Italian war bride whom he brought home from his WWII service in Italy. Anna became pregnant - both she and their son would die in childbirth. He also had an older daughter, Lana, by Georgia Farren. Gillespie eventually fell in love with Harriett DeLong. Throughout the series run, O'Connor was one of the actors to appear in every episode of the series on both networks (NBC) and (CBS), with the exception of four shows near the end of the 1988-89 season that he missed while recovering from open heart surgery."

        "Played the role of Lonnie Jamison, an officer and senior investigator on the Sparta police force. Lonnie eventually rose to the rank of Lieutenant and Acting Chief of Detectives. Lonnie was a very capable officer and took his job seriously. He usually had a serious and straightforward personality, with a dry humor that always fit the moment, and was an amiable and friendly person overall. One of the many facets of Lonnie's character was fierce never-give-up loyalty to his friends. Over the course of several episodes Lonnie's friendship with Harriet DeLong's son Eugene was shown. Lonnie was Eugene's track-team coach at Sparta High, and it was Lonnie Jamison who was able to get through to the young man when Eugene's father was being tried for murder, episode No Other Road. Later, in A Small War, when Eugene's friend was killed in a drive-by at a drug pusher's house, Lonnie tried to convince Eugene to talk about what he had witnessed. Eugene resisted, testing Lt. Jamison's patience, but when Eugene agreed to help the police identify the shooter, it was Lonnie who drove him up to Jackson. Actually, Lonnie let Eugene drive... and they took Jamison's Corvette. That scene was another example of Lonnie helping to get through to Eugene. Lonnie was a crack shot with a rifle and was often selected by Chief Gillespie to handle a situation requiring a long range rifle shot, such as in My Name is Hank, An Eye for An Eye, CrackDown, etc. Hugh was the adopted son of Carroll O'Connor."

        "Played Sparta City Councillwoman Harriet DeLong. Harriet's relationship with Chief Gillespie was deeply adversarial in the beginning, and the two clashed often when she first appeared on the show. But over the course of the series, Harriet saw Gillespie's softer, more caring side and began to think more fondly of him. By the time Denise Nicholas became a series regular, Harriet and Gillespie were becoming a couple, much to the disapproval of her son, Eugene. It was shown in the two-part episode, \"Citizen Trundle\", that Harriet's sister, Natalie was the mistress of conniving businessman, V.J. Trundle, who later had her murdered. They had a son named Eric from their illicit affair and Harriet eventually gained custody of him after Trundle committed suicide by deliberately crashing his private airplane after a confrontation about the murder with Gillespie. Emily Trundle, V.J.'s estranged widow attempted to gain custody of Eric in the following season, but only succeeding in gaining visitation rights, something Harriet deeply opposed."

Their relationship has lasted three months, which is when Kate traditionally dumps her boyfriends. Joel's boss finds out about the surgery for Nick when the insurance calls, but believes it to be for Joel and so gives him time off. When Kate comes to break it off with Joel, she learns of his major surgery and rushes to the hospital where Joel, disgusted that she only came when she thought he was having surgery breaks it off with her."
