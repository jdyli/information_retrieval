She's also worried about her daughter Cream and she asks them to check on her. Vector accepts, but Espio tells him that they don't have any space ship. However, Chuck also sends a space ship to Sonic's planet and the Chaotix are on their way. Aboard the Blue Typhoon, Sonic and Knuckles are playing chess. Knuckles takes time before moving a piece, and Sonic decides to take a quick walk outside the ship. Accidentally, Sonic slips from the ship and drifts into outer space, and Knuckles leaves the Typhoon to recover him. Inside the ship, Tails points out that another ship is approaching and everyone is convinced that it is a Metarex ship. The Chaotix are beaten up one by one when they try to get in. Afterwards, they flee, but Tails pursues them in the X-Tornado. He discovers a little house on the ship and realizes it is not an enemy ship. Chris and the others apologize and everybody brings in the stuff sent by Chris' family. Vector, thinking that Vanilla actually wanted Cream back, decide to leave the Blue Typhoon, taking Cream with them. Vector kidnaps Cream, but Cosmo sneaks along with them.

        "As the Crimson Egg makes its way through an asteroid field, it happens upon a battle between Pale Bay Leaf's forces and a group of humans. Eggman sends Shadow to destroy the Metarex ships, and Pale Bay Leaf retreats. The humans live on a nearby planet that is shattered and barren from having lost its Planet Egg. Their leader, Molly, compares Shadow to a legendary hero called \"The Black Wind,\" but Shadow denies being a hero. Eggman's goal of collecting the Chaos Emerald on the planet is at odds with the humans' hopes; they have been fighting the Metarex for generations, and Eggman's help could bring their struggle to an end. When Molly, Shadow, and Rouge set out for a nearby mineral mine to get the Chaos Emerald, Leon, another member of the resistance, asks Molly to bring back a disc from the mine. They find the Emerald, but the locker allegedly containing the disc is booby-trapped. As soon as they escape, the Metarex arrive; they have told Leon that they will spare his planet if he hands over Eggman. Indeed, Molly is the last human left who still believes in defending her home planet. This affects Shadow and Rouge deeply, and they try to convince her to come away with them, but she lacks the mental fortitude to carry her dream all alone. She attacks the Metarex herself, and dies when they return fire (this is cut in the english dub). In response, Shadow removes his limiters and completely annihilates Pale Bay Leaf's fleet (though Pale Bay Leaf himself survives). Later, standing over Molly's grave, Shadow notes that Molly was not quite like Maria; Molly was clinging to the past, while Maria was hopeful for the future.",

        "The episode begins with Sonic and his friends all getting ready for a rest. Tails tells Chris to go to bed whilst he tries to fix the security mainframe. The outline of Shadow is seen running down a corridor towards Cosmo's room. The security system comes on just in time to reveal Shadow's presence. Chris arrives on the scene to have Shadow fire a Chaos Spear at him. At the last moment, Sonic rescues Chris and takes the blow. Before Shadow gets a chance to attack Cosmo, Sonic gets back up and gets into a scuffle with him. Sonic gets Tails to run away with Cosmo. As they get outta there, Sonic gets knocked to the ground by Shadow and passes out. Amy and Cream take the injured Sonic and Chris to the hospital room, so they could be recovered faster. Tails realizes that Shadow has the technology to hack the security camera system, so he tries to shut it down. Shadow still hacks into it, but by the time he sets off, Tails is hidden with Cosmo inside the engine room. Just then, Knuckles breaks through everything he can find and confronts Shadow. Knuckles manages to knock Shadow into the wall, but gets distracted by a smoke screen and the appearance of Rouge. She tells Knuckles that Cosmo has sensors planted in her by the Metarex. Meanwhile, Shadow locates Tails and Cosmo inside the X-Tornado and a battle ensues. The X-Tornado is badly damaged, but Tails and Cosmo escape again into the air duct.

They plan on trying to eliminate the signal, but they notice that the signal is connected to the part of her brain that translates sight and hearing; thus, Cosmo will most likely be unable to see and hear if the chip is removed. While Tails and Chris are torn about this, Knuckles pushes for the surgery. Meanwhile, Amy starts searching for Sonic, but ends up bumping into Rouge. They both discover that this planet is not only Cosmo's homeworld, but the Metarex's as well. They also discover that Cosmo's people were able to transform into huge dinosaur-like beings, known as the \"Final Phase\" to protect their planet from an alien invasion. However, a few of them wanted to be able to completely destroy the alien horde, and so crystallized the Planet Egg in order to keep the transformation from sapping their energy. They eventually led to the abandonment of the planet. Cosmo, horrified by the fact that the Metarex are using her to spy on them, intends to leave, but Tails reassures her that they all will help her defeat the Metarex. Sonic and the rest of the gang also support the new resolution, and they all are ready for the final attack on the Metarex. Shadow is disgusted by this and tries to leave. Chris tries to tell him that he should help them, yet he keeps refusing, but then Bokkun arrives, telling Shadow that Eggman has been captured by the Metarex. At the same time Dark Oak has 7 Chaos Emeralds and preparation for Forestation is about to begin.

        "The episode starts off with Vanilla stopping by the Chaotix Detective Office to thank the Chaotix for all that they did for her and Cream. Amy and Cream then bring a whole bunch of snacks to Tails to try to cheer him up. (Note: This entire first part, almost four minutes long, was not shown in the English dub of the episode.) Chris and Knuckles have a little discussion about what's next for Chris, and they fall along the lines of where Chris's home would be now that he can't go back. Rouge is seen in Eggman's ship staring at Shadow's pod. After a run-in with Eggman, Rouge suspects that he's hiding something about Shadow. Chris then flashes back to the point just when the planet with Cosmo on it was being destroyed. Lucas is seen following Hertia to peace. Suddenly, the planet begins to expend all of its energy. Punching Sonic out of the way, Shadow uses the last of his energy to perform Chaos Control to stop time, giving everyone else a chance to escape. Eggman then worries that Shadow may not have survived the Chaos Control he did to save everyone, and he begins to feel some remorse for Shadow. Meanwhile, Sonic approaches Tails with only a seed from Cosmo. Tails, already upset about losing her, finally falls into Sonic's arms, punching him and crying to him that he could bring her back and that he believed in him as they fly away. Near the end of the episode, Bokkun gives Chris a letter, which surprisingly wasn't rigged. When Chris arrives at the location he was supposed to go to, Eggman shows Chris an egg-shaped pod that will take him home, but there's a catch: Chris only has three minutes to return home, or else he could be stuck in Sonic's world forever. Chris has no time to say goodbye to his friends, just as Eggman planned. Chris then leaves Sonic's universe via Eggman's pod. Once Chris is gone from sight, Eggman says that with Chris out of the way, he can continue in his creation of the Eggman Empire. The Sonic's gang proceeds to stop him once again, while Shadow is seen placing a flower near a grave, presumably Molly's grave (This is cut in the English dub). As Sonic looked over the ocean, he turned around to join the gang with the last words \"I won't forgive you, Eggman!\" (for making Chris leaving his world so soon). A pot with the seed (apparently the one Sonic found) is shown, meaning that resurrection of Cosmo could be possible. The episode ends as the pod with Chris in it flies out into space and then twinkles out.",

The girl gets flustered, and trips and almost crushes the flower, to be saved by Amu. The two introduce themselves. The girl's name is Rikka and she just transferred to Seiyo. Amu gets surprised when she's able to see Ran, Miki, Su, and Dia. On the way to school, Amu tries to explain everything to Rikka, who was distracted by a butterfly. In the Royal Garden, Amu tells the Guardians about her meeting with Rikka, but a commotion begins outside. Rikka is trying to save a cat from a tree branch. The branch breaks, and Rikka clutches the cat in fear as she falls. Amu Character Changes with Ran and saves her, while Tadase and Nagihiko get the branch. The Guardians tell Rikka to tell them or a teacher from now on if something happens. Rikka asks what a Guardian is, and after they tell her, Rikka wants to become one herself. Amu comments that she may one day since she sees Guardian Characters. Suddenly, the Guardian Characters sense an X Egg in the art room.

She tries to purify the eggs from remembering Amu doing Open Heart in the previous episode, but failed. When she was walking to school she found yet another X Egg and tries to take care of it. In the Royal Garden, Tsukasa introduces the Guardians a new transfer student in 1st grade, Hikaru. Tsukasa tells the guardians that Hikaru will be a Guardian Apprentice for the time being until the other Guardians graduate. Later, they visit the sports field where Nagihiko tells Hikaru about Basketball. He challenges him to a one-on-one match, full court. Rima states that Hikaru, being a 1st grader, has no chance against Nagihiko, who is a 6th grader. Tadase states that since Hikaru has been studying all the time, he had no experience with physical sports. Hikaru manages to touch the ball and let it slip out of Nagihiko's hands. Nearing the end of the game, Tadase said that the other Guardians will be watering the flower bed. After the game, they hear screaming coming from the sports shed. Rikka, who was running towards it helped Amu and Nagihiko, who transformed into Amulet Heart and Beat Jumper. She said that the X Egg hated balls after failing tryouts, but both Amu and Nagihiko state that it was better if it was having fun with the game other than just jumping to conclusions. The egg is purified with Hikaru following after the newly purified egg had left. Nagihiko says that he should have waited for them, which Hikaru did not and stated that he is a Guardian Apprentice, with Rikka hearing that and having the dream of being a guardian, asks Amu to be one as well. Nagihiko and Amu started to think about what Tsukasa and Tadase would think about it and approved Rikka's \"application\".",

She tries to climb up the tree, but fails. The guardian characters than bring the egg back into the bird's nest. Rikka then asks the guardian characters what happens when a X Egg is purified but the owner already has a new heart egg. Ran and the others were unable to answer the question, and soon arrived at the sports field. When they reach the sports field, Rikka spots a X Egg and runs after it. The X Egg is very clumsy and bumps into many things while trying to run away. Ran and the others go back to Amu and Rima telling them about the X Egg. Amu gets to the sports field and purifies the X Egg. Amu then scolds Rikka about going after X Eggs by herself, however, Rikka gets distracted and ignores Amu. Ran, Miki, Su, and Diamond follow Rikka, guiding her to the purified heart egg's owner. Rikka then learns what happens when a heart's egg is purified.",

        "Rikka drags Amu to the flower beds, showing her the new buds that have grown. Rima follows them and says that they need to thin out the flowers, because the buds can't absorb sunlight properly if they're too close together. Rikka disagrees, saying all buds should have a chance to become flowers. Amu tries to reason with Rikka, but she misunderstands and runs off. Later on, she finds an X Egg.

        "On the morning news The President reports about the merging planets and spending the last day with Sonic and the others until they go home. Outside Chris meets Sonic at the swimming pool who asks if he would like to go for a run with him. Tails and Chuck are working on a machine to initiate Chaos Control to send Sonic and the rest back. At school Chris and the others know what's happening until an army of flying robots start invading Station Square. An army colonel has, against the president's will, sent the robots after Dr. Eggman. Dr. Eggman is now under attack, when Sonic arrived and attempted to save Eggman. Eggman handles the robots himself with his flying fortress, and gives Sonic a box containing the last part for the Chaos Control machine. Meanwhile Rouge, Knuckles and Topaz went to rescue the President from an army of agents. Sonic went back to the lab and gives the last piece of the machine to Tails and Chuck. That evening, Chris got ready to say goodbye but he feels sad. Everyone had left the mansion and had gone to the portal. Tails and Chuck start up the portal but it stopped working. Sonic gives them the Emerald he found and they start it back up. Eggman, Decoe, Bocoe, and Bokkun in the fortress, along with all the other creatures that came through from Sonic's world, go through the portal, but it stopped working again. Tails didn't want to give up and Chuck says that they have to adjust a few things. Just then, Sam arrives and before he gets out of his racing car he drives away quickly, wondering if he could step down since he no longer has any real challengers. Everyone had a little laugh but Chris didn't. Tails works on the portal and manages to get energy from Space Colony ARK and starts it back up. Everybody said goodbye as Chris feels worried. Meanwhile Scarlet and Mr. Stewert looked at the energy and Scarlet wonders what Mr. Stewert is and Mr. Stewert says that she will have to keep investigating. Chuck tells everyone that they can't keep the gate open long and demands them to leave before a power failure occurs. Amy, Cream, Cheese, Vanilla, Tails, Rouge, and Knuckles leave now, and as Sonic is about to leave, Chris says goodbye to him(But his mind doesn't think so). Just as Sonic is about to step through the portal, Chris runs over and shuts it down.",

        "After stopping him from going home Chris runs away with Sonic and takes him farther and farther through the woods in the dark, and Sonic seems apathetic about being kidnapped by his friend. Mr. Tanaka and Topaz tried looking in the woods but couldn't find them so Topaz says that the police have to set up a search to find them quickly and Chuck says that they don't have much time to cause chaos control and send Sonic back to his world before the two worlds merge together to cause time to stop. The next morning Chris and Sonic walk through Station Square until they find a bike and rode as they left the city and headed to the desert. They stopped at a cafe to have something to eat until the news came reporting about Chris and Sonic who have run away with a video of Lindsey upset and wants Chris to come back. Chris and Sonic left the cafe and saw helicopters who are Nelson's so Sonic came to a truck to give him and Chris a lift and the bike ended up in the desert while Sonic and Chris were in the truck and escaped from the desert with the helicopters searching. Sonic and Chris stopped at a forest and then a railway track that went passed by once. Chris says that he will forget about him someday, Sonic always forgets but it would be impossible to forget about him. Soon Sonic and Chris were feeding some birds and were thinking that they will harder to find even Chris's parnets and they set off. They came up a waterfall and Sonic gave Chris a hand. Soon they walked across another forest. Chris runs and trip over a stone and Sonic asks him for a hand but Chris can do it himself and so they stop to see a beautiful lake. After failing to find Chris with his helicopter fleet, Nelson and Lindsey are ready to try to buy Chris back with whatever he wants when fortunately Chuck persuades them they need to find Chris themselves, personally, by looking somewhere Chris would want them to find him. Eventually Chris takes Sonic to a lakeside cabin that Chris and his family used to go to when he was little, but stopped when his parents started becoming busier and busier. They make a campfire and Sonic tells Chris he'll stay if Chris wants him to. Chris realizes Sonic has to go and finally admits he was lonely before Sonic came, and was afraid he would be lonely again. Sonic expresses hope that he'll see Chris again someday. So Sonic returned to his own dimension. Soon after, Lindsey and Nelson reach the cabin, and find Chris on the dock alone, and glad to see them.",

        "Sonic's friends--and enemies--have all returned home to their own world, but Sonic himself has been conspicuously absent for a week. With his nemesis gone, Dr. Eggman engages in increasingly ridiculous, but harmless, displays of power, hoping to draw him out. Amy, meanwhile, has considered Cream and Vanilla's proposal that she might live with them. Just as she is about to explain why she won't agree to it, Eggman arrives, blaring his plans for world domination over the entire suburb. When Amy attacks with her hammer, he only rubs in the fact that Sonic has not returned to her. As Amy unleashes her fury on Eggman, Knuckles and Rouge also sit together, each missing Sonic and razzing the other about it until it escalates into a full-scale battle. Drawn out by the noise, Tails flies the Tornado to the scene. He attacks Eggman with massive firepower, aided by a transformation mode that Chuck had installed in secret. Eggman responds with an incredibly persistent tracking missile that Tails can't shake off. His display finished, Eggman orders Decoe and Bocoe to press the self-destruct button on the missile before it hits Tails, and when they confess that there isn't one, he becomes distraught. It seems to be all over for Tails, until a flash of light from the moon comes closer and turns out to be Super Sonic. Sonic blows up the battleship, but rather than being frustrated, Eggman is happy that their old game is on again. Knuckles and Rouge see Sonic flying overhead, and their fight also turns from angry to playful. When Amy sees him, she runs after him until he lands... At her house, of all places. In tears, she confesses that she had just made the decision to wait for him forever, and begs him to tell her that he loves her. In response, Sonic hands her a rose and gives her an answer--which is silent to the viewer--and she embraces him. (The English dub changes this scene significantly: Amy demands that he never leave her again, to which he audibly replies that he never will.) Six years later in his own world, Chris is a skilled scientist himself. He is just putting the finishing touches on the dimensional transporter, in an attempt to cross to Sonic's world. Reminiscing with his classmates, he recalls the last night Sonic spent in his world. Sonic had the seven Chaos Emeralds with him throughout their trip to the villa, and therefore could go home whenever he wanted to... But he took Chris on one last run around the lake before using Chaos Control to go home. The audience also sees that Sonic broke down in tears, feeling sad about leaving Chris by himself.",

As the day comes to an end, Mikoto suddenly senses a power identical to her own and, upon chasing after its source, comes across Misaka 9982."

        "As the graviton bombings continue to become bigger and keep injuring people, Judgment decides to join forces with the Anti-skills to find the culprit. Ruiko mentions to Mikoto about the Level Upper urban legend they talked about before, though she does not believe that such a thing can exist. Mikoto accompanies Ruiko and Kazari to the mall, where she runs into T\u014dma accompanying the little girl from before. Kuroko and Mii finally realize that the culprit is targeting Judgment members, with Kazari set to be the next target. After evacuating the mall, with only Kazari, Mikoto, T\u014dma and the young girl left in the store, a bomb hidden inside a plush toy goes off. Mikoto fumbles her railgun trying to stop it, but everyone is saved by T\u014dma's powers. Mikoto manages to find and beat the culprit, Hatsuya Kaitabi, who wanted to punish Judgment for not protecting him from bullies, believing people with power like her and Judgment are corrupt. Mikoto punches him for using that as an excuse to hurt others, with Kuroko later telling him Mikoto would've still stood up to him even if she remained a Level 1. Mikoto meets T\u014dma the next day who explains why he didn't seek recognition for rescuing everyone, which just aggravates Mikoto.",

        "Erii explains she and Banri were telepaths who grew up in a Child Error Orphanage before Banri moved. But recently, she began hearing Banri suffering and has been trying to find her. Mikoto explains about the experiment Harumi was involved to Therestina, who theorizes that Harumi's comatose students are the cause of the Poltergeist incidents. However this theory divides Kazari and Kuroko even more as the former thinks the latter is now blaming them instead. The next day, Mikoto learns that Harumi had been released from custody and later learns that if the Poltergeist situation isn't resolved, it could potentially destroy Academy City. Mikoto later goes to investigate one of Gensei's old facilities and encounters Harumi herself, who brings her to a hospital where all of her comatose students are under the care of Heaven Canceller. He explains that Gensei theorized that an esper can become a Level 6 by taking Ability Crystals made from the essence of comatose espers who lost control of their AIM fields. He gathered the Child Errors and bailed Harumi to try and find a cure, but without the 'First Sample', the first test subject of Gensei's Ability Crystal program, their attempts at waking the students caused Poltergeist incidents. Suddenly, Therestina and the MAR who followed Mikoto's movements to the location of Harumi and her students arrives, demanding that Harumi gives up the children to their custody. Forced to choose, Mikoto takes Therestina's side since she believes the children might have a chance with her, prompting the heartbroken Harumi to comply.",
