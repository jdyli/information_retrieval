Sun goes to see Jin, who tells her that it is too late to start over. Jin goes back to the beach and helps Michael rebuild the raft, on which he has gained a spot. Walt confesses to Locke that he burned the raft because he likes the island. In flashbacks, it is revealed that the reason Jin once showed up covered in blood was because he beat a man to save him from the death sentence that Sun's father had ordered, and that he had planned to go to America with Sun to start a new life."

It is designed to make multi-angle observations of Earth and atmospheric scene spectral polarization and radiance. Objectives Determine the global distribution of natural and man-made aerosols (black carbons, sulfates, etc.) with accuracy and coverage sufficient for reliable quantification of: the aerosol effect on climate; the anthropogenic component of the aerosol effect; the potential regional trends in natural and man-made aerosols. Determine the direct impact of aerosols on the radiation budget and its natural and anthropogenic components. Determine the effect of aerosols on clouds (microphysics and coverage) and its natural and anthropogenic components. Determine the feasibility of improved techniques for the measurement of black carbon and dust absorption to provide more accurate estimates of their contribution to the climate forcing.

Rears her head the boys are ready, to face danger, conquer pain. What though from our backs in gallons Sweat is poring all the day. Shall we in the shady Tuck-Shop, Drinking syrup seek to stay? Change your shirt, the ball is thudding; Teams upon the fields are lining. Bring the gloves or get a Scout pole, Ere the sun has ceased his shining.",

Some have fought and conquered dragons, Others Nature's secrets won, Here within our sun-kissed Province, Deeds are waiting to be done. At the High School by the Bukit, where Mertajam lies her plain, Rears her head, the boys are ready, To face danger, conquer pain. To the future we'll persevere, With the proud words as our guide, Aut coepisse noli aut confice, We'll take everything in stride. Everyday you'll see us toil, Without grouses without whine, And everyday, you'll see us stand tall. Till the sun has ceased to shine. Yes everyday, you'll see us stand tall, Till the sun has ceased to shine. . . ."
