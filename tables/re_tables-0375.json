Software Hut is run in the first semester of level 2 for 12 weeks. Marks are allocated 60% on the project and 40% on an exam. The project was envisaged as student numbers began to grow in computer science departments, such that it became difficult to find enough industrial placements or projects for individual students. This led to the idea of a group of students working with a single client and later to several groups competing to produce a solution. At this time it appears that a single client was sought to work with all the teams. It follows principles of having a competitive development environment that were previously discussed in the 1970s but without the handover requirement."

Charles and Caroline are managing The Dakota Hotel; Nels, Harriet and Jonathan Garvey are working in the saloon; and Alice Garvey begins teaching school for the poor children of town in a stable since the only other school in town is an expensive private academy.

She must now travel to another town where her first job will be, while Almanzo finally realizes he may have romantic feelings for Laura, which confuses him. He eventually invites her to a church social and seems confused by that as well. Believing that 'Beth' is falling in love with one of her students, he punches him. He sees that what he did was wrong and decides that Laura doesn't like him anymore. In the end, though, Laura and Almanzo have their first kiss at a church social on her 16th birthday."

The three adolescents followed by Khan face varying degrees of prejudice. One of them, Joey, the only ethnically white subject of the film, has been the victim of frequent bullying.

        "During Charles and Caroline's visit to Walnut Grove in the year 1890, residents learn that railroad tycoon Nathan Lassiter holds deed to Hero Township. Meanwhile, Mrs. Oleson is seriously ill and is in a hospital in Minneapolis. Despite their best efforts, the residents are unable to drive Mr. Lassiter away. When they attempt to resist with force, Mr. Lassiter comes back with a detachment of Union soldiers who order everyone to leave. Though Mr. Lassiter demands the residents' instant evacuation, the soldiers allow the residents to remain until Easter Sunday. Angered at the injustice done to them, the residents decide that they should send a (literally) explosive message to Mr. Lassiter that he can have the land, but not the town. Laura and Almanzo blow up their boarding house before the residents of Walnut Grove blow up the town, building by building\u2014excluding the church/schoolhouse (which only suffers minimal damage). Lassiter and the troops return later only to see the destroyed Walnut Grove and the townsfolk all gathered in front of the damaged school. Lassiter wants them all arrested but the troop leader tells him that the residents did nothing wrong, and the leaders from the other towns tell Lassiter that if he takes over their towns they'll do the same thing as Walnut Grove did. In the end Reverend Alden says, \"Did you hear? Walnut Grove did not die in vain.\" Everyone marches out proudly singing a church song and afterward, the townspeople go off to start new lives elsewhere. The Little House on the Prairie (the last building left) is left intact and the scene ends with a bunch of Easter bunnies hopping around the Little House, signifying perhaps a resurrection of Walnut Grove in the future. Note: Originally aired as a two-hour movie. When offered in syndication, it is shown as either a two-part episode or in its entirety.",

        "Mary gets her first teaching job in the backwoods community of Willow Prairie, but she is met with stern, purely hateful opposition by the settlement's leader: an elderly woman who has driven away previous teachers, has thwarted all attempts to establish a school, and uses the Bible in a hateful way to back her beliefs. The father of a student she stays with, a loyal follower to the woman, is just as bad. The woman's adamant beliefs against common things such as reading and cleaning with soap and water are the cover for her own shameful secret: she cannot read. After one of Mary's students tries to kiss her and she slaps him in the ribs for trying to do so, she is paid a visit by the student's father and is said to have almost killed him though she had not. Mrs. Peal tells the parents Mary is a \"Jezebel\" and Mary retreats home, but goes back after Charles gives her a pep talk. She is able to expose Mrs. Peal, who learns to accept and embrace education.",

Sylvia falls from a ladder trying to escape and Mr. Webb and Charles arrive in time to kill the rapist. Sylvia later dies in Albert's arms.",
        "Out of shame due to the rumors, Sylvia's father decides that they must move out of Walnut Grove. Albert gets a job with the town's blacksmith, Irv Hartwig. Sylvia and Albert meet in secret and make plans to get married and raise her child as their own. Caroline (who earlier had confronted Mrs. Oleson about spreading lies about Albert being the baby's father) counsels Albert about whether he is ready to get married. Meanwhile, after Sylvia's father calls her a whore, she runs away. Mr. Webb, looking for Sylvia, barges into the Ingalls house armed with a shotgun, but when Albert affirms that he did not get Sylvia pregnant, Mr. Webb finally accepts this. Albert convinces Mr. Hartwig to anonymously lend him money so Albert and Sylvia can elope. As Sylvia is hiding in a barn waiting for Albert, the rapist returns, but Albert arrives and fights him. Sylvia falls from a ladder trying to escape and Mr. Webb and Charles arrive in time to kill the rapist. Sylvia later dies in Albert's arms."
