While there, the doctor tells him that he has liver failure and advises him not to continue drinking; Frank ignored the doctor's advice. While drinking and bonding with Lip over him graduating during the day, he collapses at a skating rink sending him back into the hospital. Fiona tries convincing Frank to stop drinking for either himself or his kids so he'll live. Fiona assumes that Jimmy is avoiding her over the previous day and becomes distraught over wondering about his whereabouts, even reaching his dad Lloyd to ask him where he is. His dad tells her this is typical of Jimmy. As she is about to enter the house, she gets stopped by Beto who delivers to her money he says is from Jimmy, saying Jimmy said Fiona was too good for him. Ian enlists in the army (unbeknownst to the rest of the Gallaghers). Then, he visits Mickey one last time and tells him about his enlistment, leaving him shocked and emotional; Mickey displays his love with one word, \"Don't\". Ian then departs quietly in the morning and forges identification to pose as Lip. Veronica and Kevin join Veronica's mom, Carol, in a sonogram who both find out from her that she was already pregnant for twelve weeks. Carol admits she didn't want to be pregnant yet because she wanted the closeness to Veronica and Kev to continue; she wanted to be needed by them. Sheila says goodbye to Jody, Karen, and baby Hymie as they venture off on a trip and is left alone. She then has a few friends over for whom she showcases a few of the adult toy products that she is selling. The Gallaghers, Veronica, Kev, and Sheila throw a graduation party for Lip. Fiona gets promoted in her new job. Lip thanks Mandy for her help with getting into college. And, Frank decides to leave the hospital.",
