But Frank is clearly suffering from the early stages of Alzheimer's disease. He is forgetful and mentions something odd to Tara about an absentee sibling. Meanwhile, Kate orders Zach to leave the wedding when his controlling behavior becomes too much.

After the ceremony, Tara confronts both of her parents and Bev reveals that Charmaine and Tara were placed in foster care back in 1976 because of how difficult it was to deal with their half brother Bryce, who had abused and molested the young girls.

        "Michael and Sam meet with Barry after asking him to track down the account number Michael got from Derek Poole. During lunch, Michael notices how strangely Barry is acting and realizes he is being recorded. Suddenly, the government agent responsible reveals himself - Agent Jason Bly, the troublesome agent whom Michael blackmailed in Season 1. Though Michael wishes to use the blackmail materials to destroy Bly's career, Bly has an effective counter-measure (explaining his return): he has discovered Barry's illegal investigation efforts and threatens to expose Michael's ties to Barry unless Michael forfeits the materials. Locked in a stalemate, Bly once again tries to make Michael's life miserable, and so Michael focuses his effort on a new job to help a woman deal with a stalker - Tom Prescott. While in the private bank where the woman works, awaiting Prescott, Bly once again confronts Michael. No sooner have they agreed to destroy one other than Prescott arrives. But Prescott is not a stalker: he is a bank robber. Prescott and a gang of professional armed thieves take everyone hostage, including Michael and Bly. Initially, Bly is resistant to working with Michael; acting independently, he tries to get the upper-hand on the robbers by attacking one of them. In response, Prescott shoots him in the arm, which sends Michael into action. Claiming to be doctor and, after managing to contact Sam for help (meanwhile comically interrupting his latest date), he begins to subtly sabotage Prescott's robbery efforts (with Bly's eventual assistance), giving them the impression they are having a serious case of bad luck. On Michael's cue, Sam tracks down Prescott's getaway boat and subdues one of Prescott's awaiting men. He then forces the man him to make a fake radio transmission to the remaining team, implying Sam is the mysterious owner of the bank they are robbing and is attacking their operation. The bank robbers, already decimated and paranoid by Michael's sabotage efforts, begin to crack. The conflict reaches its climax when Fiona blows up the getaway truck; Prescott and his remaining men hold one other hostage, the crisis ending when Prescott shoots and kills his remaining men and attempts to escape on his own, only to be captured immediately by arriving police. Michael and Bly, by this time, have developed a grudging mutual respect and so agree not to ruin each other's lives. In exchange for the blackmail materials, Bly agrees to release Barry and to use CSS resources to locate information on the account number. Bly reports that not only is there no name on the account, but someone (either Barry or Bly himself) accidentally tripped a security program linked to it. Whoever owns this account now knows Michael is looking into it. Bly then departs, this time on good terms with Michael.",
        "Michael and Sam meet with Barry after asking him to track down the account number Michael got from Derek Poole. During lunch, Michael notices how strangely Barry is acting and realizes he is being recorded. Suddenly, the government agent responsible reveals himself - Agent Jason Bly, the troublesome agent whom Michael blackmailed in Season 1. Though Michael wishes to use the blackmail materials to destroy Bly's career, Bly has an effective counter-measure (explaining his return): he has discovered Barry's illegal investigation efforts and threatens to expose Michael's ties to Barry unless Michael forfeits the materials.

        "Tara has discovered her teenage daughter's morning after pill prescription. After speaking into a camera, she takes off all her clothes while walking down the hall. Kate comes home to find T, the alter she is closest with, looking through Kate's clothes. Max comes home, not that surprised to find T instead of Tara, and neither is their son, Marshall. Charmaine comes over, annoyed that plans with her sister are broken since T has taken over. In the garage with Max, Charmaine expresses that she doesn't feel her dissociative identity disorder is legitimate. Later that night, T and Max share a brief moment of lust on the sofa. Max stops it, since Tara is not comfortable with him having sex with the alters, and makes T go to the shed, where she calms down and changes back to Tara. Kate meets up with her Visual Kei boyfriend and explains her mom's condition to him. The next morning, Tara drives by Kate's school and catches her boyfriend pushing her around, and she gets out to confront him in front of everyone, with zero success at all. This episode pushes her into becoming Buck. When Marshall and Max find Buck, they are intimidated, but convince him to go to a dance recital Kate is performing in that night. After the show, Buck starts a fight with the boyfriend for what Tara saw earlier. Marshall discovers why Buck is beating him up and joins. The episode ends with the family bowling, and Buck and Marshall having a moment.",

        "The episode opens to Tara on camera again explaining her annoyed feelings about the alters. The family has a meeting about what happened in the previous episode while she wasn't herself. She isn't used to the alters because she had just gotten off her medicine that kept them away. While doing the laundry, she finds Marshall's sheets smell like urine. When confronting him, Marshall shares a problem with his English teacher. He thinks on a higher level about a novel and sees an erotic meaning to it, which upsets the teacher. Their conversation is interrupted by Kate yelling profanities. Marshall wants only his dad to go talk to his teacher, which makes Tara feel rejected by her family. While shopping with Charmaine, they run into parents from the kids' school. They say they never expected her to contribute to the bake sale due to her DID, which upsets Tara and makes her transition into Alice. Alice shows up to the meeting with Marshall's teacher and successfully changes his mind by ridiculing how he was treated in high school. Out to dinner at the fictional restaurant Barnabeez, Alice upsets Kate by not being Tara. Kate purposefully upsets Alice in the bathroom where she washes her mouth out with soap. The commotion is overheard by Max, who comforts Alice. Kate, upset and needing a break from home, applies for a job at Barnabeez. Max later talks to Kate at home and shows a photo album Alice made for her, which makes her better, but sad about her mom's DID. The episode ends with Alice trying to get intimate with Max, with the idea of a baby in mind. She thinks the IUD Tara has won't work since she doesn't believe in them. Max refuses, and they both go to sleep.",

        "Phil creates a new sandwich at work, naming it after Kath and himself, but his marketing does not lead to a popular sandwich. Kim decides she wants to get back together with Craig when she learns that breeding his dog can produce large amounts of cash. These plans come under fire when her friend, who is trying to get in the good graces of a man working at the pound, brings over a small group of dogs when Craig's dog is in heat. Meanwhile, Kath finds that her plans for a flamboyant wedding are more expensive than she had thought. Kath has her eyes on an expensive 'pumpkin' carriage, but despite working overtime in her salon, she cannot earn the money needed to reserve the carriage. Phil on the other hand has been left at the altar more than once, and is reluctant to have a large wedding after the experiences. When Phil learns through Kim that Kath cannot afford her dream wedding, he arrives with the carriage, wearing a fairy tale styled tuxedo. The two profess that they want the kind of wedding the other one wants. Kim seems actually impressed by this, despite her dislike for Phil.",

The higher layers can only access the lower layers via their interfaces. In case of MIRO, these layers are: MIRO device layer - this layer provides classes to interface hardware and abstract the low level hardware details This classes enable access to hardware resources via simple procedure calls. MIRO service layer - this layer provides service abstractions for sensors and actuators by means of the CORBA interface definition language (IDL). These services are implemented as network transparent objects/CORBA objects. The classes in this layer present the sensors and actuators as generic services. For example the RangeSensor class defines functionality common to the sensors which return range readings such as sonars, lidars and other type of range finders. MIRO framework layer - on this level functional modules specific to robotics are provided. Examples are mapping, localization, path planning and similar facilities."

Needing a break, Charmaine asks Tara to take care of the baby for the day while she goes to a spa where she meets a \"fierce mommy\".

Marshall has moved in with the insane Grandma Sandy to keep distance from his family while he grieves the loss of Lionel as well as his mother, who he fears no longer exists. Meanwhile, Kate is spending more and more time with Evan and his son in St. Louis, while Neil tries to persuade a reluctant Charmaine that moving to Houston, Texas would be the best thing for their child. One by one, Tara's other alters are disappearing, after they all say goodbye to a different member of the Gregson family (the last one killed is Alice, after which Bryce sets his sights on completely taking over by eliminating Tara's original identity). Max realizes he has to take action before Bryce can do any more damage.

After Bryce attacks Marshall, Tara briefly surfaces, and Max takes the opportunity to drive her to the clinic. On the way, Tara makes him stop the car, tells him she loves him, and then gets out and jumps off a bridge.",

Tara tries to get everyone to have one last family dinner before she goes. The dinner does not go as planned-Marshall is still angry with Tara and Max flips out when they ask him to make a speech. He screams and hurls the turducken at the wall. Kate tells Evan that although she would like to be with him, she must stay home in Kansas with Marshall while Tara and Max are in Boston for three months.

      "System organization/decomposition - OpenRDK is a modular software framework focused on rapid development of distributed robotic systems. It has been designed following users' advice and has been in use within our group for several years. By now OpenRDK has been successfully applied in diverse applications with heterogeneous robots and as we believe it is fruitfully usable by others we are releasing it as open source. In our framework the main entity is a software process called agent. A module is a single thread inside the agent process; modules can be loaded and started dynamically once the agent process is running. In the figure below we see an example. Two agents are executed on two different machines and three modules run inside them: hwInterface retrieves data from a laser range finder and the odometry from a robotic base; given this data, scanMatcher uses a scan-matching algorithm in order to estimate the robot positions over time; mapper uses the estimated robot positions, together with the laser scans, to build a map of the environment. An agent configuration is the list of which modules are instantiated, together with the values of their parameters and their interconnection layout. It is initially specified in a configuration file."

        "Communication approach - Modules communicate using a blackboard-type object, called repository (see figure below), in which they publish some of their internal variables (parameters, inputs and outputs), called properties. A module defines its properties during initialization, after that, it can access its own and other modules' data, within the same agent or on other ones, through a global URL-like addressing scheme. Access to remote properties is transparent from a module perspective; on the other hand, it reduces to shared memory (OpenRDK provides easy built-ins for concurrency management) in the case of local properties. Special queue objects also reside in the repository and they share the same global URL-like addressing scheme of other properties. In the figure below, the hwInterface module pushes laser scan and odometry objects into queues, that are remotely accessed by the scanMatcher module, which, in turn, pushes the estimated poses in another queue, for the mapper to access to them. Finally, the mapper updates a property which contains a map. http://wiki.robot-standards.org/images/5/55/OpenRDK-rconsole.png"

      "System organization/decomposition - Player is a device server (application server) with the collection of dynamically loadable device shared libraries. The main portion of this server is custom communication protocol which enables client-server communication model. Player is implemented in C++ and uses POSIX compliant pthread interface for multithreaded applications. Player can be viewed as a multithreaded application server providing applications/services to client programs. Here application/services are devices which are used by client programs. Since devices (applications/services that is) can be loaded dynamically, Player can be considered as \"some way in between monolithic application and modular middleware+services\" approach. A main Player server thread listens to client side connections and spawns threads whenever the client program asks a service from some specific device. Each device (device program) has its own thread of execution. As can be seen from the figure 1, the threads communicate via a shared global address space. Each device has an associated command and data buffer. Whenever the client needs to access some specific device, it sends a command which is queued in a command buffer and then read by the device. The same applies to the data buffer: The device writes the data to the buffer and the client side program reads it. Since Player does not implement any device locking mechanism whenever multiple clients are connected to a Player server, one can overwrite the commands of other clients. This applies to commands and data (it is noteworthy to mention that data and commands are implemented as asynchronous one-way continuous streams) but not to configuration requests which can be used to access specific hardware features (this mechanism is implemented as a two-way synchronous request-reply interaction). One can also define the frequencies at which a particular device provides data to the client, by default this value is 10Hz. Depending on the needs of a client data can be served in PUSH or PULL modes, by default the mode is PUSH, so server/devices send all data available to the client."

Transport layer, this part is independent of device drivers and can be any type of transport system, of current version it is implemented as two libraries, libplayertcp and libplayerxdr, and is based on TCP communication protocol using sockets (and message queues). Other transport types which can be used are JINI and CORBA based (means there is support for RMI and RPC)."

No device locking mechanism, client side data is always older than server side data because of the \"buffer sit\" times. Devices are treated as files with read/write access. Most of the devices adopt character device model. On the client side, programs communicate with server/devices through their respective local proxycies. There is no considerable support for fault tolerant capabilities. One of the features which can be accounted for is the \u201clibplayererror\u201d library, which can be used to perform error reporting. Also, there are some procedures to perform thread locking in order to avoid conflicts. Player is supported on most of the UNIX flavors and under Windows using Cygwin.

Also, there are some procedures to perform thread locking in order to avoid conflicts. From the perspective of robustness, it should be possible to implement planning, learning, state estimation or similar functionalities for an application based on Player. In the future the authors want to implement a resource awareness attribute, i.e. enable the programs to perform resource discovery and change their behavior according to the availability of resources."

Sam and Fiona develop a new plan to have Fiona be \"kidnapped.\" Sam learns from the kidnapper the location of the warehouse where Dawn is being held, so he and Fiona attack the guards and free her. Michael, who is acting as a hostage negotiator, leads the kidnapper to the warehouse just as the police come and arrest the kidnapper. Afterward, Michael meets with a supposed CSS bureaucrat assigned to review his case. When the bureaucrat attempts to kill him, the three theorize that Michael's would-be killer was not the real bureaucrat after all, but merely an impersonator.",
