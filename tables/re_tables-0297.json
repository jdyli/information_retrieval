Her body was found by her parents when they returned home at around 3 pm. Witnesses reported seeing Yiannoulla talking to a man on the doorstep.

        "The 33-year old Nottingham taxi driver was found dead in the early hours of Saturday 14 August 1982, having been stabbed 87 times. The police believe he was robbed of his takings and then stabbed, mostly in the chest. 11 people were arrested but no one charged. The father of eight, was sent to Peel Street at about 4am to pick up a passenger, called 'Shelton' who rang from a phone box. Police believe he picked someone up before driving to Cyprus Road, about a mile away. At 4:05am, a woman living on Cyprus Road heard a car brake suddenly and looking out of the window, saw the taxi rocking violently as though a fight was taking place. She also reported seeing a man searching the taxi's dashboard. She called the police then went to help but Mr Landa died shortly after police arrived. The police re-opened the case in August 2012."

Although no one else has ever been charged with the murder, the investigation coincidentally revealed a fraud committed by the Baroness against her late aunt, Lady Illingworth. Police investigating the fraud made a search of the grounds of Heath House for missing gold bullion said to be worth some \u00a310 million, but nothing was ever found."

He had been tied with a stereo wire that was found with the remains. He is thought to have died 2\u20133 years before being found. It is not clear if the body had been brought into the UK from abroad. In May 2002, Detectives appealed on Crimewatch UK in the hope someone would recognise him but nobody called in to say who he was. In September, a new reconstruction of the man's head was released in a fresh appeal to identify him. He was 25\u201335 years old with black or dark brown hair and 5ft 8\u20135ft 9ins tall. He was thought to be Mediterranean, Middle Eastern or North African. He was wearing a gold chain that had a 22-carat pendant with the verse 225 from the Koran, the Holy Text of Islam, inscribed in Arabic across it. In September 2006 a funeral was held for the mystery victim."

One theory is that he was the victim of a house buying scam. He told friends he was in the process of buying a new house and planned to view it the day after he was attacked. It was later discovered the home had never been on the market. The murder remains a mystery to police, however Alex's mother and brother are convinced they know who murdered Alex. His brother said: \"I know who was behind this but they got someone else to carry out their dirty work for them.\""

He was 5ft 6\u2013 5ft 8 ins tall and aged between 20 and 30. He had a deformnity to his legs that was probably the result of a childhood disease. There was no clothing at the scene, no vehicle abandoned nearby, no personal effects on the body. Tests on chemicals in the bones suggest the victim would probably have lived the last ten years of his life in the West Midlands. Investigators focus on the Birmingham and Wolverhampton areas. Earlier investigations showed him to be more than likely of Asian origin but could not rule out his being a white European. It's suspected that the person could have been an illegal migrant, possibly from India."

The Man signs himself and her up for a marathon to support a trip to Oman. But although she doesn't want to, the professor has 'anonymous donors' forcing her to run in the marathon. Her first day training with George, she gets tired and has to take a cab home. The Man offers to train her, but later breaks his ankle tripping, and George has to step in as personal trainer. He watches a TV show about getting fit and takes notes, and the next day he runs with Professor Wiseman, but she doesn't think running was fun. So George took her to a park carnival, where they rode the Ferris wheel, watched a puppet show and grabbed balloons. The day of the marathon, everything went well, with George and the Man (on crutches) cheering her on. But then she wanted George to run with her to the finish. Afterwards she gave George her medal.",

George draws out his Christmas list with a simple picture but The Man cannot seem to figure out what it is, nor can anyone else to whom he shows it, like The Doorman or Chef Pisghetti. The Man tells George to just surprise him and George decides to make him a present, although he cannot decide what to make. This begins a series of misadventures in which George tries to figure out the perfect gift for the Man. Meanwhile, Betsy tries to write her Aunt Margaret a new Christmas Carol but everything about Christmas, from snow to Santa, already has a song. Soon Betsy writes the first song about a Christmas monkey, and The Man with the Yellow Hat is visited by Mr. Reloj in a dream who shows him what George's life would be like if he were the animal companion of other characters on the show. Through the dream and the realization that George's picture is a diagram of the toys displayed in the toy store's window, he learns that he understands George and is the best companion for him. Finally, the Man with the Yellow Hat gives George the presents displayed in the window, and George gives a banner he drew with pictures of the various things they have just gone through together.",

The autopsy report stated that she had been strangled with her own scarf. In 1982 the Metropolitan Police announced that they were to review their files on the case following some anonymous telephone calls. To this day, no one has been charged with Jean's killing and it remains unsolved. Britain's National Archives have indicated that the police files on the case are likely to be made available for public inspection in 2031."

She left home after a birthday party at her parents house. Screams were heard coming from the rest garden. Lucy's body was found strangled. She had been raped and her killer had ripped her abdomen open and stabbed her vagina over 20 times. Some speculate that the killer was Arnold Booth, a resident of Sneinton in Nottinghamshire, though it is unclear whether any evidence exists to link Booth to Lucy's murder. In 1977 Booth was sentenced to life imprisonment having been convicted of the murder of Renee Howard."

She was wearing a pink, frilled Marks & Spencer nightdress, but a better clue was the brown plastic sheet in which she was wrapped, bearing the letters NCR (National Cash Register). Only six such sheets were made by a Scottish company between 1962 and 1968, but police never identified the woman, let alone her killer. Today, there is no grave or headstone, just an unmarked spot in a Swaffham churchyard."

MacRae had planned to spend the weekend with her lover in Perthshire, a married man, who was also Andrew's father. On the evening of Friday, 12 November 1976, MacRae left Inverness and headed south on the A9. At ten o'clock that evening a train driver reported a car ablaze on a lay-by adjacent to the A9 trunk road at Dalmagarry. The bodies have never been found, though traces of blood matching Renee and Andrew's blood type were discovered in the boot of the burnt out car. Attention focused on the nearby Dalmagarry quarry, were a senior member of the police believed they were buried. A 2004 excavation of the area found nothing of interest, however a local farmer has opined that the bodies could be buried under the A9, which was in the middle of a major programme of upgrading at the time of the disappearance. The farmer called for the road to be excavated at the spot where a radar survey he commissioned found \u201canomalies\u201d."

His head and hands had been removed to mask his identity. He was never identified and buried at Haywards Heath cemetery in 1994. In March 2009 police exhumed the body and gave a revised description of the man. He was between 5ft 6 and 5ft 8, aged possibly in his 30s but believed to be as old as 45 and well built. They have issued pictures of his clothing, including a light-blue shirt, with a distinctive motif on its pocket. At the time of the crime, police said they were seeking the driver of a grey estate car who had been seen in the area shortly before the body was found. He was described as \"Scandinavian looking\" and in his 30s."

It is believed the victim was wrapped up in carpet off cuts and dumped in a narrow space in the area. She had suffered a fractured collarbone, jawbone and neck. It is believed death occurred sometime between 1960 and 2009. She was thought to be aged 18\u201335 and between 5ft 1 and 5ft 7in tall. She was discovered with a distinctively patterned pinafore style dress, wearing a blue bra, and a blue jumper. A black high-heeled shoe was also found. A white plastic Guinness measuring chart, thought to be used in pubs, was also uncovered along with a long off-cut of an orange carpet."
