Natsuno remembers how he did not want anything to do with the villagers since he moved here, until he met Toru. Meanwhile, Toshio still cannot find a source to the anemia-afflicted victims.

Ritsuko learns from a villager that the local policeman Takami died, with his family suddenly moving away without saying their goodbyes. He is replaced by another officer named Sasaki. Ritsuko realizes that another family also moved away when one of their kin died, and coincidentally, they employed the same mover company. Toshio is called to perform resuscitation on Mikiyasu's son, Susumu. He notices that Mikiyasu is also suffering from early symptoms of the illness. Toshio tells Seishin over the phone that Susumu is indeed suffering from anemia just like the other victims. Unfortunately, both father and son's condition is too late to be saved. Seishin wanders into the forest and encounters Sunako going out for a walk. Sunako tells him that she suffers from a disease that makes it too dangerous for her to be exposed in sunlight. Toshio gathers the hospital staff and announces that nineteen have died since September 10th, with Mikiyasu being the latest victim. They discuss the possible causes and plan to put up a report for the Public Health Department. Natsuno gets a lack of sleep from seeing visions of Megumi and requests to stay at Toru's place. At night, Natsuno senses Megumi and Tatsumi's presence and realizes it's not a nightmare. Megumi is jealous of Toru's presence and is about to bite down on him, with Natsuno unable to move.",

Toshio and Seishin argue over the ethics of staking corpses before they become okiagari. Seishin discovers Sunako's secret. Toshio is confronted by the shaman and several villagers wanting the truth and he denies anything to do with okiagari, but when they won't leave he agrees he'll check the pulse of the father at Kanemasa mansion if he agrees to it. At the mansion, Seishirou Kirishiki \u2013 Sunako and Tatsumi's father \u2013 explains why his wife and daughter can't go outside during the daytime. Toshio checks Seishirou's pulse; Mr. Kirishiki has a normal pulse, body temperature, and respiration. That night, the shaman is tricked into rescuing a woman's family to get rid of her."

Later on, Kaori visits Seishin asking for a name for her grave. Her mother and father has died, and her brother has disappeared. Kaori believes that Megumi will kill her next, and she has already dug up her grave. Seishin tells her that she should still try to live. Seishin makes a decision and leaves the temple. Meanwhile, Ritsuko receives a call from one of the nurses \u2013 the nurse has been taken hostage. Ritsuko runs to save her, but on the way, she passes a truck with the gagged nurse. Ritsuko stands there in the middle of the road as two shiki approach her. Ozaki drives to Ritusko too late \u2013 she has already been bitten. Alone in his hospital at night, Chizuru visits Ozaki. She reveals that Seishin has decided to serve the shiki and visited Sunako that day. Ozaki tells Chizuru that he wants to survive to see the village die, and she bites him. Chizuru tells him to burn all evidence of the deaths."

Eventually as the mysterious deaths start piling up, Motoko's father-in-law dies. Her mother-in-law refuses to let Toshio perform an autopsy on the body, claiming that doctors care about the money more than their patients. Eventually Motoko's husband dies, followed by her daughter becoming ill. She then carries her daughter over to the Ozaki clinic in a crazed state however when she arrives, the clinic is closed (because Toshio is conducting experiments on his risen shiki wife.) She then rushes over to the Kanemasa clinic which is also closed during the daytime. Motoko's mother-in-law shows up and scolds her for shaming herself in public and states that her daughter is fine. However, her daughter dies, followed by her mother-in-law. In a frightened state she locks herself and her now ill son in their home, where he dies in her arms, and eventually rots.

The gang leave to do errands, except for Sohara and Ikaros, who becomes increasingly worried. Sohara tells Ikaros to go; on the way, Ikaros sees Tomoki and tells him goodbye forever. Tomoki is confused by this, and after meeting back with his friends, decides to look for her. When Ikaros finds Nymph, the latter tries to talk her into returning to Synpase but they are attacked by the Harpies. Hurt by the betrayal, Nymph protects Ikaros but is knocked down. Tomoki runs out to the hills but does not know where further to go; fortunately his friends come and help. As the Harpies tear out Nymph's wings. Tomoki and the others arrive. Ikaros reveals her true identity: a battle class Angeloid capable of mass destruction, but Tomoki replies he already knew, and orders her to protect Nymph and kick the enemy's ass. Ikaros battles the two, going into full Uranus Queen mode, while Tomoki and the others try to break Nymph's chain, finally doing so while Ikaros defeats the Harpies with her Uranus system. As the battle comes to an end, It begins snowing, and back at Tomoki's house, They celebrate the Christmas Party and Ikaros's and Nymph's First Birthday, Tomoki decides for the Angeloids to stay with them and surprise them with orange seeds. Ikaros cracks a smile for the first time in her life."

A flushed out Tomoki is taken to a wedding chapel; with Sugata and Mikako presiding, Ikaros appears dressed in a bridal gown; she and Tomoki go through a wedding ceremony, but when they are about to kiss, Tomoki stops. Mikako then gives him a choice: he can pick Ikaros, Nymph, Astraea, or Sohara, all of whom are dressed as brides. Tomoki screams at the indecision, but the ceremony is interrupted by a reformed Chaos, who gives Tomoki a hug, and becomes the newest resident Angeloid.",
        "Chaos is returned to Daedalus. Things return to normal, with Nymph restoring Ikaros's memories, and Ikaros learning bathroom etiquette, but Tomoki has one more perverted task: transforming into pool water so he can fondle girls during swim class. After Sohara and Nymph drain the pool, Mikako decides he needs to be taught a lesson. Tomoko escapes the hunt by hiding in the girls' bathroom, but is eventually trapped. While Sohara saws down the door lock, Tomoko has no choice but to escape into the toilet and go through sewage treatment to the sea. Later on, Ikaros, in trying to practice bathroom etiquette of knocking and flushing, knocks a hole in the door and flushes Tomoki again. As Ikaros searches for Tomoki, Mikako sees her and offers to help with her proposal situation.
