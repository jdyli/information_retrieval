        "Tired of TJ and his friends getting all the glory from King Bob, Lawson decides to get a new gang of his own together. 20 minute special Note: Before the commercial break, T.J. breaks the fourth wall, saying \"Recess will never be the same.\" After the commercial break, a shortened version of the intro to Recess plays, but, breaking the fourth wall, it abruptly stops when Miss Finster put her hand on the ball. Lawson shouts to stop, and said \"I got an idea\". The intro plays again, but Lawson's gang takes the role of T.J.'s gang. Note: This episode is the last episode to air on ABC.

Sondra steals Matt from Will, and the two girls compete in a one-on-one skiing competition. Will tries to cheat by skiing in her guardian form (with a coat and hat to cover it up). Hay Lin flies above her and uses her powers to keep Will steady. Unknown to them, Phobos wants to take advantage of this trip to divide them and separate the other four Guardians from Will and the Heart of Kandrakar.

The real Elyon is upset that she didn't bring her sketchbook from Earth, so Phobos sends Lurdens through a portal to her old bedroom to fetch it. The creatures also trash a stash of chocolate, and Blunk is able to use the scent to track them to Phobos's and Elyon's secret Meridian mountain hideout. The Guardians and Caleb search for Elyon under the mountain but are ambushed by Lurdens. Forced into the open, they battle Cedric on the mountainside before returning to Earth, no closer to warning Elyon of the terrible danger. In the B-story, Will needs some privacy. In order to save Elyon, the girls trick their parents into thinking they are having a sleepover party, but Will is grounded for having a mess in her room."
