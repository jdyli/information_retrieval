Simmons manages to teleport the Battle Creek zealots to Sidewinder and convinces them to attack and defeat O'Malley. Lightning from Lopez's weather device hits Church, thereby damaging the bomb in his body. When Sarge is subsequently unable to disable the bomb, Tucker tries to destroy Church with O'Malley's rocket launcher before Church explodes, but Wyoming snipes the launcher out of Tucker's hand. The bomb explodes and, due to the damage received from the lightning, destroys the present as well, sending both teams (except Church) to the future (Halo 2). Donut attempts to direct a play to explain this sequence of events to Tucker. The group reasons that they were blown into the future because they were standing in front of Church; Tucker deduces that Church must have been blown into the past. Meanwhile, on a Marathon 2 map, Church appears, wondering what has happened. A common joke in the Halo games, rapidly pressing the crouch button on top of an enemy's corpse, is used here as the Battle Creek zealots rape Doc's body, much to O'Malley's disgust (\"Help,I'm being violated!!!\").",

The moment Church is teleported away, however, another Church runs in and tells Gary to teleport him to Sidewinder instead, because he \"screwed everything up.\" A deliberate error is employed as a joke as after 1000 years of waiting, Church has grown a four-foot white beard, yet he is inhabiting a robot body. Back at Blood Gulch prior to the events of episode 1, this Future Church decides to try to prevent the death of Tex, which would prevent O'Malley from escaping and causing the events leading up to The Great Doom. He finds, however, that he either has no effect, or causes the events by his presence in the first place: Lopez's legs malfunction because Future Church, in trying to get him a larger switch, kicked dirt into the switch Sarge decided to use when building the robot. Prior to episode 1, the Blues were under the charge of Captain Butch Flowers. Knowing Flowers would die, Future Church gives him aspirin, but Flowers dies of a heart attack due to an allergy of the medicine. Tucker, at this point in Blue armor, takes Flowers' cyan armor. Donut, in rookie Red armor, finds the Blue Base and steals the flag because Future Church, failing to recognize him outside of pink armor, gives him directions. Future Church attempts to prevent the death of his past self, which would stop Tex from arriving in Blood Gulch. He awakens the tank and runs through her protocols to try to prevent her from shooting him later. She refers to herself as Phyllis, and overrides her name when Church addresses her as Sheila. Future Church turns off a \"friendly fire protocol,\" which in actuality prevents friendly fire; thus the original Church's death takes place because of Future Church. Finding a sniper rifle on the corpse of his past self, Future Church picks it up but drops it later. Caboose finds it, and uses it to shoot Sarge. Attempting to kill Donut to stop him from killing Tex, Future Church fails and retreats to the cave, frustrated. Caboose spots what \"looks like Church,\" and turns on his radio. As a result, O'Malley infects him. Another obvious error is that Caboose said his name was O'Malley before he saw Future Church, when he radioed Church about Tex finishing repairing Sheila.",

        "Future Church watches Tex, Donut and Tucker leave for Sidewinder, and soon follows them. He talks first to Sheila before leaving for Sidewinder, asking her to do him an inaudible favor. Once at Sidewinder, Future Church finds his past self and Grif in prison, and opens their cell by pressing a button in another room. He attempts to contact Tex, who is currently being held by O'Malley and Wyoming, before another Church approaches him. This new Church claims that he fails to stop the bomb, and gets blown back in time again, only to return to Sidewinder. He then tells Future Church to \"meet us at the top of the ramp.\" The bomb goes off, and Future Church is sent back in time. As seen in Episode 50, as soon as Church is teleported by Gary to Blood Gulch, Future Church arrives and asks to be sent to Sidewinder because he screwed everything up. Just then, more Churches arrive, each having been unsuccessful to stop the bomb, and thus sent back in time to Gary. These Churches all meet in Sidewinder, and explain to the newest Church how their various plans failed. It is determined that whichever Church did each one of these plans already must be the successful Church, since he isn't sent back in time again. This Church gives up on trying to correct everything, instead freeing Tex, and rejoining the Blood Gulch soldiers before the explosion, thus being sent into the future. Church emerges at O'Malley's base, just in time to ask Gary, who remains there, to stop the bomb from detonating. He then prepares to explain the events he went through.",

        "The episode opens up again at the Zanzibar fortress as Tucker and Caboose are attempting to teach English to the Alien. Church and Tucker get into a small debate on whether they should teach the alien English or learn his language. Tucker is convinced that they should teach English to the Alien and even had created some visual aids. As it turns out, Tucker was able to get the writing supplies from Caboose's gun which apparently contained crayons instead of bullets. However, when Tucker activates his energy sword to cut the poster boards, the Alien jumps over and attacks him. Despite Tucker's cries for help, Church watches the Alien as it attacks Tucker in order to \"evaluate\" his fighting style. Back at Blood Gulch, Simmons is at the Blue base with Sheila close by. He attempts to contact the Red Base, but is greeted with Donut on the line, who tries to impersonate an answering machine. Simmons attempts to get Sarge on the line, but Donut, under instructions from an off-screen Sarge, denies Simmons from communicating with Sarge, even after he informed Donut that he had captured the Blue Base and Sheila. Eventually Donut hangs up on Simmons, but not before letting Simmons know that he really enjoys his new job as Sarge's right-hand man. Simmons then declares that he will kill all the Reds and tells Sheila to \"lock and load\". Back at Zanzibar, Tex talks with Andy. Tex, through some bluffing and mild threats of blowing up Andy with a remote detonator, convinces him to help her translate what the alien is saying. This, however, doesn't stop Andy from making rude jokes about Tex acting more male than female.",

Eventually, Church relents and agrees to this arrangement out of his curiosity as to what could happen. During this whole conversation the Alien is still beating Tucker to a pulp. At Blood Gulch, the Reds are fracturing even more as Donut is unsuccessful in asking Grif to return to their base. Grif refuses, believing Sarge simply wants him to do work, and not just eat ice cream. In reality, Sarge did want Grif to help him eat some of the ice cream that he found. Simmons\u2014now painted mostly blue\u2014plays out his vengeance on the Reds. At first he attempts to cause the Reds to be jealous of him; he soon gives up and orders Sheila to attack the Red base. At Zanzibar, with Andy acting as a translator, the Alien reveals that he came to retrieve the energy sword that Tucker found. It was part of the sacred quest that he was on, but the sword has now locked itself to Tucker as he was the first to find and use it; this explains why Tex was unable to use the sword. As a result, Tucker must join the Alien on its quest. If Tucker refuses, the alien will destroy the base and slaughter everyone in it.",

        "At Zanzibar, Tex and Church argue over whether to let Andy translate what the Alien is saying. Church is concerned that Andy's lack of manners could upset the alien even further. Eventually, Church relents and agrees to this arrangement out of his curiosity as to what could happen. During this whole conversation the Alien is still beating Tucker to a pulp. At Blood Gulch, the Reds are fracturing even more as Donut is unsuccessful in asking Grif to return to their base. Grif refuses, believing Sarge simply wants him to do work, and not just eat ice cream. In reality, Sarge did want Grif to help him eat some of the ice cream that he found. Simmons\u2014now painted mostly blue\u2014plays out his vengeance on the Reds. At first he attempts to cause the Reds to be jealous of him; he soon gives up and orders Sheila to attack the Red base. At Zanzibar, with Andy acting as a translator, the Alien reveals that he came to retrieve the energy sword that Tucker found. It was part of the sacred quest that he was on, but the sword has now locked itself to Tucker as he was the first to find and use it; this explains why Tex was unable to use the sword. As a result, Tucker must join the Alien on its quest. If Tucker refuses, the alien will destroy the base and slaughter everyone in it."

        "On Zanzibar's beach, Tucker finds himself as an involuntary sword-bearer as he is forced to partake in a sacred quest. After the Alien explains the lands that he and Tucker will travel through, Church informs Tucker (the fighter) that Caboose (the wizard), Andy (the archer), and the alien (the healer) will be the team that goes out on this quest. Though this quest is pretty much a suicide mission, Tucker does warn Church that he better hope that Tucker survives, or he will be forced to take care of any children that Tucker might have. At Blood Gulch, Simmons' attack on the Red Base continues. However, he has been so indoctrinated with hatred of the Blues that all of his insults and attack orders confuse the words Red and Blue. Grif, still watching Simmons and Sheila fire upon the Red Base, convinces Simmons to come back to the Red Base. Despite the selfishness of Grif's reasons, Simmons admits he misses the old days. However, just as he is about to go back to the Reds, Sarge sees that Simmons has painted his armor mostly blue and is unable to accept him back. Sarge says he can understand many things, even the reasons for attacking one's own base out of anger, but to see one of his former soldiers wear the colors of the Blues, is unacceptable.",

As Grif runs to and fro on it, both Simmons and he question how Sheila was able to upgrade the base without any tools or arms. Simmons then concludes that if he could somehow determine the real truth, he could reconcile with Sarge. At this point, Sarge intervenes, knocking Grif out.

In the match, the new Freelancer, Agent Texas, spars with Wyoming, Maine, and York. Meanwhile Freelancers Washington, North Dakota, South Dakota, Carolina, and C.T., overlook the battle from above. During the match, using her strength and agility, Tex easily defeats her three opponents, winning Round one. As Round two begins, York tries to coordinate a plan with his teammates. However, Maine and Wyoming, attack by themselves instead, leading to all three having many repeated failures. The three then start attacking Tex from all sides. Tex, however, easily kicks and punches them around, impressing the other Freelancers overlooking the battle. York tries again to regroup his team, but continues to be ignored by Maine and Wyoming, leading to further defeat. In round three, the arena is reconfigured to feature raised cover, and the four Freelancers are given guns to use, which fire a special immobilizing paint that makes their armor stone hard. While York, Maine, and Wyoming look for Tex in the arena, Tex quietly uses her surroundings to get the best of them. Tex continually outsmarts her opponents, eventually winning rounds three to eight. In round nine, Maine and Wyoming purposely load their pistols with live ammunition, shocking York. As the two start firing, York tries to protect Tex, but she refuses his help, telling him \"Never abandon your team.\" As the battle becomes more intense Maine throws a grenade towards Tex, which she easily dodges. Unfortunately, the grenade lands near York, but before it explodes, Tex shoots him with the immobilizing paint, to try to protect him. The grenade explodes as the episode ends, alarms are heard, and a medical team is sent to the training room.",

As the medical team arrives, Washington comments that a Freelancer's armor hardens after it locks down, explaining Tex shooting York with the hardening paint shortly before the explosion; something that may have saved him from worse injury. The Director then arrives and berates Washington for following the rules of the training floor, saying that the enemy won't fight according to protocol on the battlefield, and that Wyoming and Maine showed initiative and creativity for using live ammunition and will therefore not be punished. The Freelancers are left confused by the Director's statement, with Carolina becoming suspicious of Tex. Back in Blood Gulch, the Blues are disoriented by the grenade explosion, which turned out to be a flashbang grenade. Blinded and partially deaf, they begin to open fire in random directions while Tex (just arriving to Blue Base) watches on, commenting on their incompetence. Meanwhile at Red Base, Simmons lures Lopez to the caves near the base. There, he plans on tricking Lopez into walking into a puddle of water that he electrified with a battery. Lopez overhears Simmons' plan to kill him and tells him that he will go around to another entry to the cave. Simmons attempts to catch up to him, only to step into the water and get electrocuted.",

The Director then arrives and berates Washington for following the rules of the training floor, saying that the enemy won't fight according to protocol on the battlefield, and that Wyoming and Maine showed initiative and creativity for using live ammunition and will therefore not be punished. The Freelancers are left confused by the Director's statement, with Carolina becoming suspicious of Tex. Back in Blood Gulch, the Blues are disoriented by the grenade explosion, which turned out to be a flashbang grenade. Blinded and partially deaf, they begin to open fire in random directions while Tex (just arriving to Blue Base) watches on, commenting on their incompetence. Meanwhile at Red Base, Simmons lures Lopez to the caves near the base. There, he plans on tricking Lopez into walking into a puddle of water that he electrified with a battery. Lopez overhears Simmons' plan to kill him and tells him that he will go around to another entry to the cave. Simmons attempts to catch up to him, only to step into the water and get electrocuted.",

        "After accidentally shocking himself, Simmons wakes up to find himself chained up in front of Lopez, who is now disguised as him. Lopez tells Simmons that he is going to pose as him so he can get access to the equipment he needs to investigate the earthquakes. However, Simmons mistakenly believes that Lopez is trying to replace him to become popular. Leaving Simmons in the cave, Lopez manages to fool Sarge and Grif into granting him permission to use their equipment, despite the fact that he is still speaking Spanish. Meanwhile, a curious Donut decides to investigate what the disguised Lopez is up to, while the real Simmons manages to break free from his bonds and leaves to confront Lopez. At the Blue Base, the Blues finally recover from the flashbang and angrily ask Tex why she would attack them. Tex replies that she was merely reacting to an unexpected situation, as she was told she was sent to replace a Blue Team member who was killed but sees no evidence of a death. Church quickly lies to Tex, saying that their teammate \"Andersmith\" was killed and that they had removed his name from the roster. While Tex goes to make a call to Command, Church tells Tucker and Caboose that he lied to Tex so that she would stay in Blood Gulch a little longer to investigate the nonexistent death. Tucker is skeptical about the plan while Caboose is completely fooled by Church's lie and genuinely believes that \"Andersmith\" used to be a part of their team. Tex then returns and says that they're going to \"even the teams\" by killing one of the Reds so that she can leave Blood Gulch as soon as possible, much to Church's dismay.",

        "On the Project Freelancer ship, \"Mother of Invention\", the Director speaks with the Alpha AI before quickly dismissing him when Carolina appears. They both join the other Freelancers and the Pelican pilot Four-Seven-Niner and begin briefing on their next mission. Members of the UNSC loyal to the Insurrection have acquired a high level asset and are holding it in a secure building. The asset, codenamed the \"Sarcophagus\", can only be accessed by a key code held by an official of the program that created it, who will be arriving by car to inspect the asset. Because the building will be locked down at the first sign of trouble, both targets must be attacked simultaneously, meaning there will have to be two teams. The first team - Carolina, Washington, and Maine - are tasked with infiltrating the package storage facility. They are unexpectedly joined by York, whose quick recovery from his injuries surprises the other Freelancers. The second team, composed of North, Wyoming, and C.T., will act as recon for the first team until they infiltrate the building. After that, the second team will then ambush the official and obtain the key code. Also, as a result of her poor performance in her last mission, South is barred from participating in this mission. When Carolina asks if Tex will be joining the mission, the Director asserts that enough questions have been asked; C.T. then quietly tells Washington that the Director hasn't said \"no\". Carolina then adds that they don't know how big the Sarcophagus is, but that it would have strange markings on the exterior; something North saw at the oil refinery. After the Director says that they know what it is, C.T. asks rhetorically how it is that they know what it is but not how big it is; she quickly dismisses the question after receiving a glare from the Director. Four-Seven-Niner also adds that since their Pelicans are being modified to be as light and fast as possible, they cannot bring any heavy weaponry or equipment with them. The Freelancers are dismissed and the episode ends with two Pelican dropships disembarking towards the planet they are orbiting.",

        "The episode begins in Blood Gulch, with Grif yelling at and insulting the Blue Team; in the hopes that he'll make them mad enough for them to send a bomb to the Red Base to use in Sarge's plan to stop the planet from destabilizing. He eventually succeeds and Tex builds Andy the bomb. At Red Base, the Red team prepares to begin their voyage to the center of the planet with the drilling machine Sarge built with a massive excavator he ordered online; both which Grif points out that no one noticed until Sarge pointed them out. Afterward, Tex drops off Andy and he begins to count-down to his explosion, something Grif forgot to think about. At Project Freelancer, the Director and the Counselor speak with a disoriented Delta; whom they say was just recently created. Delta initially believes that he is Alpha but the Director quickly corrects him and directs Delta's attention away from the issue.",

Since they are all about to die, Simmons takes the time to admit that he had always utterly despised his teammates. However, Andy turns out to be a dud and fails to explode, sparing the Reds. Meanwhile the Blues get Sheila running and try to use her to get out of Blood Gulch before the cataclysm. Church however decides to stay and tells them that if they find Agent Washington they tell him that \"Memory is the Key\". Instead of leaving with Caboose and Tucker, Tex decides to stay behind with Church, saying that he's never let her down yet. Church tells her that it had taken several versions of him to finally realize that in order get what you wanted, you sometimes have to let go of it first. Tex muses that she just proved the theory right and both she and Church stand together to watch the end of the world.

York notes how they've recently been fighting cops and UNSC soldiers and asks a question that has been bothering him especially since Tex arrived, \"are we the good guys?\" While North says that they are, York tells him that he didn't sound so sure, a statement with which North agrees with. Outside, South looks at the Freelancer rankings and turns away in disappointment when Tex becomes the new top ranking Freelancer, knocking South out of the top 6. Later, Washington catches C.T. finishing a transmission to an unknown person, saying that she needs \"more time\". Seeing Washington, C.T. tells him to mind his own business before storming off.",

At Blue Base Epsilon-Church begins to explain to Tex that he figured out what the Director and Alpha could not. Tex was a by-product of the Director's longing to see Allison again, so strong in fact, that she was what drove him: her memory. After all they've been through Church tells Tex, \"I forget you,\" finally allowing her to leave his memories and letting go. At peace, Church tells the world to do its worst. However, as the sky rips open further, Caboose calls into the Epsilon Capture Unit to Church, amazed that he is still alive. The Reds look on in confusion as Caboose, whom they believe to be God, calls out to Church, then Sarge suddenly appears next to Caboose to help, further confusing them. Realizing that the world is not ending but he is being rescued, Church despairs loudly and begs to be left here. In the past, Carolina is seen looking over the updated rankings, as she is dropped to second behind Tex. The Director approaches her and tells her that things are going to change and he needs her to do \"a great many things\", some of which might be questionable. Carolina obliges, saying that he gave her everything and would do anything for him. Epsilon comes out of the capture unit, furious with Caboose and Sarge and questioning why they came to get him and risked so much. Caboose informs Church that they and the others fought through many soldiers to rescue him, and did it for \"her\", who knew how to get Church out, whom Church assumes to be Tex. Caboose corrects him that it is not Tex but the \"new lady.\" A nearby door opens revealing an alive Agent Carolina - long believed to be dead - who tells Church (whom she believes to be the Alpha) that now that she has him, he's going to help her what she should have done years ago: kill the Director.",

He reports to the Blue Team to treat Tex, who has already died. Church explains this to Doc, noting how his and Tex's bodies are both buried in front of Blue base.

Caboose has also apparently begun to habitually utter death threats to Tucker in a deep, menacing voice.

Sarge finds Simmons in the holographic projection room beneath their base, and interrupts Simmons' heartfelt talk with a holographic version of Sarge. Above ground, Grif, Sarge, and Simmons discuss their strategy for combating Blue Team, which involves restoring the information of the Blue Team in Command's databases that was previously erased by Sarge, because the team reasons that they can't beat an enemy that doesn't exist anymore. Sarge tells Simmons to wake up Donut, who was shown to be still unconscious earlier in the chapter, but they find him missing.

As Sarge berates Grif, it is revealed that Caboose was blown up by a mine and seemingly killed, but he shortly falls from the sky, perfectly fine. The guide explains that the area is a restricted dig-site, and is soon joined by a friendly alien, \"Smith\", apparently of the same species as the previous Aliens they'd met, revealing to the surprised soldiers that they are working together. In the meantime, Simmons tries to apologize to Lopez, but again offends him by making a comment about Mexicans holding grudges. Realizing he has blown it, Simmons looks for another way to blow up Blue Base.

Epsilon-Church rises up from behind and obliterates CT with his laser face, but now Sarge, Caboose, Grif, Epsilon-Church, and Tucker find themselves facing the aliens. At Valhalla the Meta's jeep won't start and the Reds have no ammunition to combat the Meta with. Simmons attempts to use the jeeps chaingun to gun down the Meta, but is unable to turn it due to lack of power. Just before the Meta attacks, Agent Washington appears, telling him to stand down, and demanding Epsilon from the Reds. The Reds are confused at the situation, but Washington loses all patience, shooting Lopez in the head and firing at Donut, seemingly killing him. As Simmons calls out to his fallen teammates, Washington flashes back to his meeting with the Chairman, who asks Wash if the Reds and Blues would just give Epsilon back to him. Wash claims that he has no desire to simply ask for Epsilon back, since Epsilon's retrieval will allow him to leave behind a life of betrayals and double-dealings."

        "Doc hits the Meta with a blast from his overloaded scanner, knocking him back temporarily. The Meta attempts to punch Doc, but the blast causes his temporal distortion unit to malfunction, slowing him down drastically. Simmons quickly theorizes that his punch will still carry the same force as normal as they are merely viewing the Meta from a different timeframe, but Doc ignores him. When the Meta's fist connects with Doc's helmet, he is slammed into the base wall. Simmons attempts to pull him free, but is forced to abandon him when the Meta recovers. Simmons is then blasted away from the base by the Meta's weapon and manages to grab onto the Warthog turret when Sarge and Grif drive by. As the trio tries to escape, the Meta uses the grav-lift to launch himself onto the hood of the jeep, destroying it and throwing the Reds out. As the Reds prepare to fight, Epsilon-Church arrives and catches the interest of the Meta. He lures the Meta back towards Blue base, briefly pausing when he recognizes it from his memory flash. The Reds take the opportunity to flee through the hole in the wall, which leads to another canyon. Epsilon-Church soon regroups with the Reds, with the Meta and Agent Washington, now recovered, in pursuit. Sarge, Griff and Simmons attempt to enrage Epsilon-Church in order to activate his energy weapon, but they are unsuccessful. However, the mere sight of Washington sends Epsilon-Church into a rage, activating his energy weapon and melting the stone around the hole, sealing it. Now out of power, he mentions that they \"can't let them get to her first\" before passing out. The Reds retreat while Washington assures the Meta that they still have a lead. Doc, still stuck in the wall, calls out for help.",

Tex reveals that this was where Alpha was sent after the very first break in, of which she was a part. It was here more and more \"tests\" were run on him. Other AI were used in the torturing process of Alpha, with Omega and Gamma being used to create tests that were impossible for Alpha to win, driving him mad, and breaking him to the point he could not recognize anybody, not even Tex. When Church asks if she and the other Freelancers succeeded, Tex says no, and that she failed herself and Alpha. In the desert, Washington asks Doc if he can comment on the Meta's current condition. Doc only reiterates that the Meta has too many pieces of equipment that he cannot operate properly anymore. Upon asking Washington what would happen if somebody attempted to use armor enhancements without an AI, Washington responds that there are negative side effects.

She uses several hidden weapons as well as explosives as her Wash and the Meta attempt to use the capture unit on her. While she at first appears to be winning, Tex slowly loses ground. During the fight, the explosives collapse part of the ground they are fighting on, and Washington narrowly escapes death when Doc saves him. Eventually, the Meta manages to stab the storage unit into Tex's visor, capturing her. Epsilon demands that they release her, but Washington explains that the unit is failing, and that Epsilon will be leaving with them. Epsilon resolves to fight them. Washington asks the Meta for the memory unit, but the Meta attaches it to his own armor, allowing him to cloak. Washington tells Doc to protect Epsilon, and is forced to fight with the Meta. Before Washington is about to be killed by the Meta, the Reds and Blues suddenly arrive in a Pelican dropship. The ship crashes due to Grif's inept piloting, almost knocking Doc off a cliff.

Washington tells him that the unit was rigged to be one-way, lest Epsilon \u2014 the intended target \u2014 escapes again. Washington explains that the unit will not survive being transported to a facility without sufficient means to do so. Washington says that if he lets her out, Epsilon will have to come with him.

As the others leave, Epsilon says that he can get Tex out, but Washington refuses, stating that he needs Epsilon to get him out of all the trouble he is in; if Epsilon becomes stuck in the unit, the authorities will never believe Washington and he will never be cleared of the charges set against him. Epsilon states that he has to help Tex, as she is there because of himself, the Alpha and the Director. He explains that he learned from the Director's journals that Tex was a by-product of the creation of Alpha, and was a memory of the Director's lost love, Allison. Because all the Director could remember of Allison was her death, Tex is forever doomed to fail just when victory is within her grasp. As Epsilon asks Washington if he can imagine what that must be like for Tex, the storage unit suddenly raises from the snow, and the Meta decloaks, revealing that the unit is still attached to his back.",

        "Continuing from where the previous episode ended, the two Insurrectionist soldiers open fire on C.T; only for it to be a hologram. Shortly after, the real C.T. incapacitates the two soldiers before greeting the Insurrectionist elite, thus confirming her affiliation with the Insurrection. After giving the elite a datapad containing information on Project Freelancer, they then discuss an artifact that the Insurrection has discovered before the UNSC and Project Freelancer. The elite and his soldiers then prepare to leave, urging C.T. to go along with him; stating that the other Freelancers will soon be onto her. Meanwhile, back in the station's hangar, South reports to Carolina that the Leader isn't present in the facility, but instead is somewhere inside the scrapyard. Just as Carolina orders South, Washington, and North to prepare to enter the scrapyard, York arrives. Back in the present, Washington and Carolina engage several soldiers while Grif, Tucker, and Simmons secure several Warthogs for transport. After the soldiers are killed, Epsilon Church then asks everyone why they decided to rescue him. Caboose explains (to the surprise of Church) that Carolina wants to find the Director and since Epsilon Church has all of his memories, he may know where he is; but Caboose also mistakenly believes that when they find the Director they will throw a surprise party for him. Epsilon Church is skeptical about the plan, stating that just because he has the Directors memories, that doesn't mean he can recall them at will. Carolina then tries to give orders to the Reds and Blues, only for them to not understand what \"sync\" is or not caring about it, with Caboose randomly saying different appliance names; leaving it up to Washington to summarize for them. The group then finally leaves the facility.",

When North introduces Theta to his sister South, Theta mentions that he also has many brothers and sisters. The Director arrives, to prepare a test for Theta and North. He reminds Delta that protocol forbids direct interaction between A.I.s, then orders it to administrate the test. During the test, Theta is able to successfully operate North's Domed Energy Shield armor equipment to defend against multiple automated turrets, compensating for changes in the situation. With Theta's aid, North is ultimately able to eliminate all the turrets, greatly impressing Washington and York.

In grief, the Leader takes her helmet and puts it on, revealing that the C.T. the Reds and Blues encountered in Recreation was the Leader all along. In the present, Washington is surprised at the truth as Carolina retrieves what she was looking for; the card with information about the Director."

        "In the present, as Washington and Carolina return from the Leader's corpse, Caboose manages to finish installing Church into Carolina's Mongoose. When Washington and Carolina study the data they salvaged from C.T.'s corpse, they find data on the alien artifact Epsilon-Church temporarily used as a body. Tucker recognizes the artifact and informs them that they had found and used it, though he claims it was a pain in the ass for them to deal with. However, Caboose admits that he had lost the artifact shortly after it was damaged when Church transferred to a new body, which enrages Carolina. The datacard is also revealed to be corrupted, meaning that they have no more leads in the hunt for the Director. Afterwards, Carolina decides to go off alone to visit an abandoned fortress on a nearby island, taking the Mongoose with her. As the Reds and Blues head to the temple to rest, Tucker asks Washington where she is going, Washington replies that she had \"lost something\" and \"needs time to find it again\". Also a modified version of the song \"A Girl Named Tex\" plays as she drives away into the distance. In the past, the Chairman chastises the Director for letting C.T. and her valuable armor escape. Frustrated at failing the mission, Carolina begins practicing close combat drills. Both York and North keep an eye on her from above, and begin talking about each other's AIs, such as how Theta is afraid of the dark and how Delta is constantly making calculations. Both Freelancers are acutely aware of the fact that all of the AIs seem anxious about something, as if they know something that the Freelancers do not. North decides to go to sleep while York stays to keep an eye on Carolina.",

Church reveals himself and then asks Carolina what her motivations are and why she can't trust the Reds and Blues, causing her to go on a rant over how she couldn't even trust her fellow Freelancers. Church then delves into Epsilon's memories and summons Delta, who begins playing York's video diaries, recorded after he left Project Freelancer. In the diaries, York expresses his wish to see Carolina again, and gets excited when he hears rumors of a rogue female Freelancer, but is disappointed when he learns that it is Tex. He then reminisces about how he and Carolina first met and wishes things between them turned out differently, implying romantic feelings between them. Carolina asks Church why he showed her those diaries and responds by saying \"Because, I know what it's like to spend your life chasing ghosts.\" Carolina thanks Church, and reveals she wants to kill the Director to take revenge for all of the Freelancers and others he victimized, Church included. They both begin to bond, with Carolina becoming much nicer toward him and Church agreeing to analyze the Director's diary logs for any information. Meanwhile, back at the alien temple, the Reds and Blues become increasingly anxious about Carolina's motives.

        "In the past, Washington finally regains consciousness after the implantation of Epsilon into his armor went awry. North explains that due to the incident with Epsilon, all future AI projects have been cancelled, with the existing AIs due to be confiscated by the Director. However, Carolina angrily protests against the idea of having her AIs taken. North further explains that while Washington was unconscious, Tex had gone rogue, allegedly attacked Wyoming and attempted to steal his AI and equipment, and left the base. However, North is skeptical about Tex being the culprit for the attack on Wyoming, due to his knowledge of her reluctance to use AIs. He then says that Carolina will most likely be tasked with hunting down Tex when an alarm goes off. Elsewhere in the base, Tex breaks into a secure vault with York's help, telling him that there's someone she needs to see. Unbeknownst to them however, Maine is sharpening his Brute Shot and preparing for battle as the Meta. In the present, Carolina and Church gather the Red and Blue teams in the holographic training room under the Red base. They announced that they have found the Director and tracked him to three old Freelancer bases he could be at, and make plans to attack them. However, the Reds immediately balk, pointing out that they believe the mission was to find the Director, though Carolina says that plans have changed. The Reds then say they have no wish to be used as bait in Carolina and Church's personal vendetta, and claim that it isn't their fight. Tucker follows suit, calling Carolina a psycho and proclaiming that he doesn't need to follow her orders anymore. Carolina attempts to force them to comply at gunpoint, but is stopped by a furious Washington, who sides with the Reds and Blues. He states that he considers the Reds and Blues his friends now, saying he is already responsible for enough problems for them in the past, and would be damned if he lets Church and Carolina cause any more. Angry that nobody is willing to participate in the mission, Church loses his temper, begins to grow in size and goes on a rant where he blames the Reds and Blues as the cause for most of his problems in the past, remembering being shot in the head, having a bomb being put in one of his robotic bodies and being killed by his own tank as examples. Church realizes too late what he's done, as the Reds and Blues, including Caboose, leave the room in disgust as Church tries to apologize. Washington is the last to leave and coldly warns Carolina that she needs to figure out the difference between her enemies and friends. Carolina attempts to shrug off their departure, but is clearly demoralized by the unpleasant feud.",

The Reds then say they have no wish to be used as bait in Carolina and Church's personal vendetta, and claim that it isn't their fight. Tucker follows suit, calling Carolina a psycho and proclaiming that he doesn't need to follow her orders anymore. Carolina attempts to force them to comply at gunpoint, but is stopped by a furious Washington, who sides with the Reds and Blues. He states that he considers the Reds and Blues his friends now, saying he is already responsible for enough problems for them in the past, and would be damned if he lets Church and Carolina cause any more. Angry that nobody is willing to participate in the mission, Church loses his temper, begins to grow in size and goes on a rant where he blames the Reds and Blues as the cause for most of his problems in the past, remembering being shot in the head, having a bomb being put in one of his robotic bodies and being killed by his own tank as examples. Church realizes too late what he's done, as the Reds and Blues, including Caboose, leave the room in disgust as Church tries to apologize.

        "After breaking into the Mother of Invention, Tex begins making her way to the labs. However, after defeating a group of guards, she is confronted by South who tries to kill her with a missile pod. North then intervenes, saving Tex and buying her time to continue on while he confronts South. Meanwhile, after defeating Wyoming, York tries to create a distraction in order to help Tex. First he hacks into the ship's systems and causes it to fire missiles at itself, disorienting the crew. He then disables the artificial gravity, neutralizing the guards and allowing Tex to bypass a hostile Scorpion tank. Determined to stop Tex, the Director orders Carolina to stop her by any means necessary. Carolina pursues Tex throughout the corridors of the ship until York attempts to stop her. She asks York why he is siding with Tex, and replies that he's not rebelling because he agrees with Tex, but because he's doing what he feels is right. He asks Carolina to let go of her rivalry with Tex and flee Project Freelancer with him. However, Carolina refuses to let go of her jealousy and both she and York reluctantly fight, with Carolina easily incapacitating York. She then leaves behind her lighter for York to find before continuing her pursuit of Tex. Both women eventually encounter each other and begin a brutal fight throughout the ship's corridors. However, due to the damage it has taken, the Mother of Invention goes out of control and crash lands on a nearby planet, ejecting Carolina from the ship and knocking her out. Tex takes the opportunity to access the ship's systems in order to find Alpha. She finds Alpha and tries to convince him to leave with her. However, Alpha does not remember Tex and is reluctant to leave the ship, saying that it probably isn't possible anyway, and he is very tired and wants to rest. Disappointed that Alpha doesn't remember her, Tex has a short chat with him before logging out of the system, with both of them agreeing that they hate goodbyes. Outside, Carolina regains consciousness to see Maine approaching her. Before she can do anything, Carolina is grabbed by Maine, who forcibly takes both of her AIs and then throws her off a nearby cliff as Tex watches in horror, but as Carolina falls, she pulls out her grapple gun. Soon, the Director and his forces begin to regroup, forcing Tex to flee the scene. Sigma alongside Iota and Eta materialize next to Maine as Sigma warns Tex \"Run, Agent Texas.

After an unsuccessful search at their first target with no one there, their second target yields results when FILSS mentions that the Director had entered the facility years ago but has not left since. Meanwhile, in Valhalla, the Red and Blue Teams are continuing their \"war\", with the Reds attempting to negotiate with the Blues to get their flag back by giving up their stuff, though they all start to admit that it's starting to get depressing. Simmons decides to reveal and trade the Meta's Brute Shot for the flag, though Grif protests since he wants to keep the \"Grifshot\" for himself and use it as a mounting piece. As Washington and Grif argue over what to do with the Brute Shot, Doc asks the teams whether they really are okay with letting Church leave by himself. When they point out that Church has been nothing but trouble for them and mention all of the problems they had to deal with in the past, Doc responds by pointing out how their past adventures had changed them for the better. For example, Sarge finally got to lead a real military operation, Tucker learned how to use his Plasma Sword, Washington found a new team, Simmons found his old team, Doc himself managed to keep a patient alive for the first time in his career, and Donut didn't die. Realizing this, the Reds and Blues decide to go after Church. Washington attempts to stop them, saying that it's stupid and that they are being too reckless facing almost impossible odds, also pointing out that the Director plays for keeps. Sarge points out that being stupid and reckless helped them get things done and that Wash and the Freelancers have seem to forget: the Reds and Blues were able to beat the Freelancers time and time again. Sarge also mentions the fact that the Freelancers may have better equipment, plans and training, but they lacked the one thing the Red and Blue Teams have: a team they could count on. He also gives Washington his choices: keep playing it safe, or get a little reckless for once. Wash says this is the stupidest idea ever, but decides to join them anyway. As all agree to go, they realize Church and Carolina have a huge head start on them and wonder how they will be able to catch up to them in time, when suddenly a trio of UNSC Hornet gunships arrive to arrest them, unknowingly proving Wash's theory that he and the Reds and Blues are indeed wanted criminals.

However her obsession to defeat Tex as well as reminiscing about her failures in the past causes Carolina to eventually be knocked down.

Her morale restored, Carolina tells the teams to 'lock and load'. To help even the odds, Church enters Caboose's mind and manually angers him into smashing through the robot army.

        "In the offsite storage facility, Church and Carolina find the Director in a room with FILSS watching a video file of Allison leaving to join the military again. The Director repeatedly says that he needs more time to bring Allison back and that he's close, but Church ignores it and goes a rant on all of the actions the Director has to answer for, such as what he done to him, Carolina, Wash, Tex and all the others he hurt. Carolina tries to calm Church, but he continues ranting on the lies the Director has made and for the torture on the AIs, all just to bring back a shadow, and he must pay for all of it. Carolina looks at the Director in disappointment as he looks back at her, showing that they both have the same eye color. Realizing killing the Director won't solve anything nor heal past wounds, Carolina tells Church to leave, but he claims that they came all this way to kill the Director, though Carolina reminds him that he needs to let it go. She also says that the past doesn't define a person for who he or she is, but that it's a starting point to what they will become. After leaving a pistol for the Director at his request, Carolina kisses him on the forehead and leaves, just as the Director is saying \"You were my greatest creation.\" Church tells the Director he doesn't know who he is, but he knows that despite being a copy of the Director, he is a better person than him. In response, the Director says \"I wasn't speaking to you.\" As Church leaves, the Director orders FILSS to delete all files dealing with Project Freelancer, including FILSS, except the video of Allison and to shut down every Project Freelancer facility, including the one he is in. FILSS warns him that doing so will shut off the life support system in the facility, though the Director insists. Before shutting down, FILSS asks him if Project Freelancer was a success, he replies no but claims he came very close, and that he wish he knew earlier. He then finishes with saying \"perhaps the next time around.\" The Director and FILSS say their goodbyes to each other as the door to the room lowers down, sealing the Director in with the pistol in hand. Outside the facility, Church and Carolina acknowledge that the journey is over. They thank each other for showing the other a different side of themselves after all they've been through. Carolina then asks Church about where the Reds and Blues will go now, as Church answers that there's one place they haven't been to yet the Reds and Blues can call home. In the past at Freelancer Command, the Director and the Counselor discuss where to hide the Alpha. The Counselor points out that the Alpha will need a security detail, someone they can trust, so he nominates the blue soldier, which turns out to be Flowers, also known as Agent Florida. The Director mentions they'll need a cover story for Flowers' \"disappearance\", as the Counselor has the state of Florida break into several pieces on a computer screen behind them. Then the Director points out that they'll need a place to put the Alpha where no one will be able to think to look for it, then the Counselor says he believes he knows a place, Blood Gulch. Back in the present, the Reds and Blues begin to settle back in Blood Gulch as Church and Carolina watch over them. Carolina then tells Church that military equipment had recently been stolen from Project Freelancer by some low level soldiers, pointing out they should get them, hoping to do good things to replace all the bad things they've did, though it may not be good enough. Church considers staying one last goodbye to the Reds and Blues, but Carolina tells Church a short story about her mother, who came to see her and then leave time and time again, but Carolina says that her mother never said goodbye, as she believes that not saying goodbye means you're not really gone, but just not here right now. Church tells Carolina that her mother must have been smart. Carolina agrees but said that her mother had a bad taste in men (This may prove that Carolina is likely the daughter of the Director and Allison). Down in Blood Gulch, Caboose calls to Church to come down with him, but realizes Church and Carolina are gone. Tucker asks Caboose if he found Church and where he may have gone to. Caboose replies no and that he doesn't know where Church is, but says that he's somewhere but isn't here right now. As Caboose and Tucker head inside their new home, Church's sniper rifle is left lying on a hill overlooking the canyon of Blood Gulch.",

        "At the base where Church was stationed, South and Delta are trapped by the Meta in South's collapsing domed energy shield. South, seeking only self-preservation, orders Delta to store himself in a portable component, intending to abandon him alongside her shield enhancement in order to buy time for her escape. Washington, Church, and Caboose arrive on two motorcycles, and South is wounded by Caboose to prevent her escape. When Church learns that the Meta takes armor enhancements from other Freelancers, he reasons that it may also have Wyoming\u2019s time distortion enhancement from the ship at Outpost-17B. He quickly fires a rocket launcher at the Meta, who stops time to avoid the shot. The Meta is about to shoot Washington when its armor malfunctions, ending the time distortion and forcing it to flee. Figuring the Meta is taking refuge to repair itself, the group decides to find the Meta before it can be fully functional again. Delta, citing South's severe wounds, is implanted in Caboose. Once there, he informs Washington of South's intention to abandon him in order to escape, reminds Washington of her previous betrayal, and reveals that South's brother North suffered a similar fate. Under Delta's advice, Washington executes South via a pistol shot to the head. In the memo, the Director believes that the Meta is nothing more than just an entity seeking to gain more power, which he believes is a common situation after the Great War.",

It is mentioned that Wyoming's helmet was on the crashed ship causing Washington to comment that the Meta is more powerful than previously thought.

It tells him that Washington is re-assembling the Blues, so he makes plans to gather the other members of the Red team. For reasons not stated, Sarge cannot retrieve Donut, leaving only Simmons and Grif. He then tells Lopez that he's leaving him behind, to Lopez's delight, and departs. At Grif and Simmons's new base, both are about to be executed for selling their ammunition to the Blue team when they are unwittingly saved from death by the firing squad by Sarge's arrival. Sarge takes them both with him, unable to comprehend that Grif is the base's sergeant, even after countless attempts trying to explain it to him and departs, leaving the remaining Reds utterly bewildered.

The Meta then lifts up a Warthog and throws it at Grif, who flees. Washington and Church then confirm that the Reds are not in allegiance with The Meta after Grif and the rolling chassis of the Warthog pass by their hiding spot. In the memo, the Director admits that Project Freelancer was given only one A.I. for experimentation, and believes that they aim to find creative solutions for unexpected problems."

This is when Sarge comes up with the idea to \"erase the Blues.\" Meanwhile, in the AI vault, Washington explains everything to Church. During the Great War, the human race was in danger of losing, and Project Freelancer was one of many projects created with the intention of winning the conflict. They were only given the Alpha AI, and as Simmons stated in Chapter 14, an AI cannot be copied. The Director decided to subject it to different stressful scenarios, causing it to fragment in order to survive, and each fragment was harvested into the several different AI's given to the Freelancers. The fragments represented a personality of the Alpha, as Delta represents Alpha's logic, Omega represents its rage, Sigma represents its creativity, and Gamma represents its deceit. Alpha was unable to keep its memories intact, which is what led to Epsilon's creation. After being implanted with it, Washington knew what was done to Alpha through flashes from Epsilon, but never told his superiors. It is also the reason why he would not allow another AI in his system, in case it discovered the secret. Washington concludes by explaining that, after an attempt was made to steal Alpha, it was moved to another location, which explains why Church was stationed in Blood Gulch (a place nobody would think to go to), why he was transferred to a different base by himself for 14 months, why he agreed with everything Delta said, why he felt nothing under Omega's control, and why he can move from body to body. It is because Church IS the Alpha AI. In the memo, the Director believes that it is very predictable that the investigation is what politicians crave for, and to quickly return to the old.",

        "The Reds and Blues attempt to flee the base in their vehicles while Washington attempts to finish Project Freelancer by activating an EMP inside the base. The Meta follows him inside the facility as he predicted. Washington heads towards the terminal allowing him access to the failsafe and suddenly the Counselor and the Director speak and attempt to stop him. The Meta arrives and it is revealed that the Meta is Agent Maine, who is attempting to gain the trust of Project Freelancer so he can meet the Alpha AI, a promise made by the Director. The Meta shoots Washington as per his orders. Meanwhile, Caboose loses the immobile body of Church as they escape from the base and has to leave him behind due to the imminent EMP which threatens Epsilon. Washington, answering Maine's question of where the Alpha is, reveals Church in the form as the Alpha AI, who jumps inside the Meta's head, still maintaining that the EMP will not kill him because he believes he is a ghost. This allows Washington to activate the EMP, destroying all AIs and other equipment, including Church, throughout the base. The Red Team's Warthog is disabled by the pulse, however Caboose manages to escape and save Epsilon from the EMP wave by driving his vehicle off a cliff. In the memo, the Chairman informs the Director that the Oversight Subcommittee have dispatched officers to place him under arrest, and states that when the UNSC rewrites morality protocols for dealing with A.I.s, they'll rename entire sections in the doctrine after the Director, securing his name in history. In the epilogue, the Director steps down from his position after the Chairman presses full charges against him and Project Freelancer and details his final memo to him. In Valhalla, the Reds discuss their new base given to them as a reward for their services to the military and it is revealed that Caboose has moved into the adjacent one and attempts to bring Epsilon back online. The Director reveals in his final memo that he loved a woman early in his life (most likely Tex) that was killed many years ago, and that given the chance he could have saved her, and the memory of her had haunted him his entire life, and more so in the last few years than he could ever have imagined.

        "The Reds and Blues attempt to flee the base in their vehicles while Washington attempts to finish Project Freelancer by activating an EMP inside the base. The Meta follows him inside the facility as he predicted. Washington heads towards the terminal allowing him access to the failsafe and suddenly the Counselor and the Director speak and attempt to stop him. The Meta arrives and it is revealed that the Meta is Agent Maine, who is attempting to gain the trust of Project Freelancer so he can meet the Alpha AI, a promise made by the Director. The Meta shoots Washington as per his orders. Meanwhile, Caboose loses the immobile body of Church as they escape from the base and has to leave him behind due to the imminent EMP which threatens Epsilon. Washington, answering Maine's question of where the Alpha is, reveals Church in the form as the Alpha AI, who jumps inside the Meta's head, still maintaining that the EMP will not kill him because he believes he is a ghost. This allows Washington to activate the EMP, destroying all AIs and other equipment, including Church, throughout the base. The Red Team's Warthog is disabled by the pulse, however Caboose manages to escape and save Epsilon from the EMP wave by driving his vehicle off a cliff. In the memo, the Chairman informs the Director that the Oversight Subcommittee have dispatched officers to place him under arrest, and states that when the UNSC rewrites morality protocols for dealing with A.I.s, they'll rename entire sections in the doctrine after the Director, securing his name in history. In the epilogue, the Director steps down from his position after the Chairman presses full charges against him and Project Freelancer and details his final memo to him. In Valhalla, the Reds discuss their new base given to them as a reward for their services to the military and it is revealed that Caboose has moved into the adjacent one and attempts to bring Epsilon back online. The Director reveals in his final memo that he loved a woman early in his life (most likely Tex) that was killed many years ago, and that given the chance he could have saved her, and the memory of her had haunted him his entire life, and more so in the last few years than he could ever have imagined.

        "The episode starts with the first journal entry from Washington. Admitting it's been awhile since doing these, Wash decides to get up to speed: he recalls the corruption of Project Freelancer, its demise, his job as Recovery One, and Project Freelancer using the Reds and Blues as canon fodder for their agents in training. The only people Wash could trust was the Reds and Blues, and together were able to bring down Project Freelancer and the Director once and for all. He mentions that they are shipwrecked, crashed on their way home, and fears that if help doesn't come soon, someone else may find them first. Finishing his entry, Wash hears the Blue's tank fire, and sees that Sarge and Simmons are using it on their base, though Grif is still in the base. Wash asks the Reds who gave them the tank, but quickly realizes Caboose gave it to them. Sarge says that he's renovating their base, also mentioning how unfair it is that the Blue's base is under the crashed ship and Grif complains that they are closer to the food storage. Wash tells them that they need to ration the food they have, as they need to fix a communications dish to call for help, and they will be screwed if they run out of food before the dish is fixed. Caboose and Wash take the tank back to their base.",

Wash also reminds Tucker that until they're rescued, they need to be more mindful of the resources they have and to report to him about anything. Wash then says that with Church and Carolina gone, he's responsible for holding the team together. Tucker then makes a badly timed joke about the crashed ship's entire crew dying at the time of the crash. At Red base, Sarge continues to complain about the base layout such as the sandbags in the west wing. Grif agrees with him by also mentioning the hole in the base's roof. Simmons, having designed the layout, doesn't see the problem. He says it's the ideal place for his garden and that it's under the damaged engine of the ship to keep them warm, though Sarge mentions the huge amounts of radiation the engine gives off.",

Tucker asks why Caboose isn't doing the training like he is, with Wash answering that Caboose is having one of his \"off days\". Wash then has Tucker run laps around the canyon. Later, Wash finds Caboose standing in front of a mirror, depressed because Church is gone. Wash tries to comfort Caboose, but Caboose goes on a walk by himself still depressed, leaving Wash to ponder on what he's going to do with him. At Red base, Sarge is still continuing to complain about the base layout.

Wash tries to get Caboose to run the course, which Caboose completes almost immediately, saying afterward he needs to do something.

        "Give Us Sugar is a 2-CD compilation album collecting rarities from throughout Black Lab's career, including non-LP B-sides and songs previously exclusive to movie soundtracks. It was intended to be released as a limited edition of only 250 sequentially numbered, autographed copies, but the number of pre-orders far surpassed that limit, so the band changed the publishing and distribution approach. The hand written numbering on the CD front covers still stated the edition number as one of /250 (e.g.: 519/250), and the exact number produced is not known. CD 1 tracklist \"Underground\" \"Horses\" \"Black Eye\" \"Keep Myself Awake\" \"Good Day\" \"Tell Me What to Say\" \"The Moon\" \"Hole in the Sky\" \"Sugar\" \"Free\" \"Gone Away\" \"Lucky\" \"Not Too Late\" \"Head on a Skate\" \"Rock Star\" \"I am a DJ\" (Live) CD 2 tracklist \"Like I Used To\" \"Mexican Sand\" \"Your Body as a Marker\" \"Good Life\" \"Philadelphia\" \"Lust\" \"Call\" \"Play With Fire\" \"Tell Me Why\" (Demo) \"See The Sun\" (Demo) \"Perfect Girl\" (Demo) \"Circus Lights\" (Demo) \"Come On\" \"What Child is This\" \"Body of an Angel\" \"Gates of the Country\" (Acoustic)"

Church approaches the Reds and warns them to disable the ship so that O'Malley can't escape, before entering Caboose as well. Inside Caboose's mind, Church finds Tex and O'Malley negotiating their deal to rule the Aliens. He kills them both, causing them to leave Caboose's mind. After killing himself, Church emerges from Caboose's head to find that in the interim Tex has taken the sword, while Junior and the New Alien have boarded the ship. O'Malley then infects Donut. Tex then knocks him out forcing O'Malley to jump to a different host. After jumping to multiple hosts, O'Malley jumps back into Tex and boards the ship to escape. However, Sarge has placed Andy on board, and gives the order to detonate. The ship disappears, followed soon by an explosion.",

Inside Caboose's mind, Church finds Tex and O'Malley negotiating their deal to rule the Aliens. He kills them both, causing them to leave Caboose's mind. After killing himself, Church emerges from Caboose's head to find that in the interim Tex has taken the sword, while Junior and the New Alien have boarded the ship. O'Malley then infects Donut. Tex then knocks him out forcing O'Malley to jump to a different host. After jumping to multiple hosts, O'Malley jumps back into Tex and boards the ship to escape. However, Sarge has placed Andy on board, and gives the order to detonate. The ship disappears, followed soon by an explosion.",
