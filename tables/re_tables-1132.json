After school, Morikawa and his buddy Y\u016bta Izaki steal Aichi's Blaster Blade from him. Aichi runs to a card shop called Card Capital to find that Morikawa lost it in a bet against Kai.

Back then, after seeing a young Aichi beaten up, the young Kai cheered him up by giving him Blaster Blade and telling him to imagine himself as a strong warrior like the card. With that in mind, Aichi got absorbed into Vanguard, creating his own deck in the hopes of playing against Kai, who had already moved away by then. Back to the game, Aichi deals a bit of damage to Kai, who retaliates with his ace card, Dragonic Overlord. It wipes out Aichi's units and greatly damages him.

Aichi launches a final attack with Blaster Blade and drive checks a critical trigger, which breaks through Kai's defenses and deals one more point of damage to Kai, thus giving Aichi the win.

However, Emi misinterprets the situation as Aichi hanging with the wrong crowd. Concerned for her brother, she secretly follows the trio to Card Capital. There, Emi is astounded by all the people in the shop, including Aichi, Morikawa, and Izaki, playing Vanguard. It is then that the card shop's manager, Shin Nitta, appears and introduces Emi to the world of trading card games. The two then observe a cardfight between Aichi and Morikawa.

        "The match between Aichi and Tetsu continues while an anxious Kamui watches. Confronted by Nagisa, Gouki and Emi, who learned of the situation via Team Caesar, Kamui, who had been hiding from his teammates throughout the entire tournament, is motivated to go support Aichi. Aichi begins to make a comeback by shutting down his opponent's offense and evening out the damage with a heal trigger, but Tetsu rides Demon World Marquis, Amon, and with a critical trigger, he pushes Aichi down to five damage. Aichi gains a vision of the Royal Paladin knights joined together, and draws and rides Soul Saver Dragon, whose effect is used to power up all his units.

Aichi enters the shop and is greeted by the members of Ultra Rare where he asks them if he was strong in the last tournament. Everyone is then surprised when Ren enters the shop. Confronting Aichi, Ren explains what has been happening to him lately and the nature of the power, Psyqualia. Ren tells Aichi that Kai will only acknowledge strong fighters and that he must get stronger. Ren then gives Aichi a Shadow Paladin deck, the dark opposite of his Royal Paladin deck. Seeing through Psyqualia, Aichi is nearly overwhelmed by the deck's power and believes this new deck makes him invincible. Kourin believes he's being arrogant and challenges him to a duel with her Royal Paladin deck. In the match, Kourin is easily and soundly defeated by Aichi using Blaster Dark and his new Shadow Paladins, demonstrating the fearsome power of Psyqualia.

They find Kai, who is beating all the underground fighters to relieve his frustrations. Kourin soon challenges him to a fight, where Miwa and Jun get to sit in the middle of the action. While Kourin uses her Royal Paladin deck, Kai reveals his newly modified Kagero deck, which focuses on Amber Dragons. As each of them are dealing damage to each other, Kourin confronts Kai about how it's his fault that Aichi has fallen into the power of Psyqualia, saying that Aichi only sought the power because he wanted to become stronger for Kai's approval. Kai agrees, and also claims that he had seen the corrupted effects of Psyqualia before, not knowing how to prevent it from happening. He then tells Kourin that it may have been one simple thing: to exceed that power. Kourin then asks Kai if he can stop Aichi before he falls completely under the influence of Psyqualia, to which Kai says that he can. After losing to Kai, Kourin gives him Aichi's Royal Paladin deck, and hopes that he can succeed where she had failed.

        "Kai heads to the Underground area to await his fateful match with Aichi. Back at home, as Aichi reviews his Shadow Paladin deck, he receives a Psyqualia-induced summon from Ren who is waiting for him at Card Shop PSY. Aichi, led by Ren's Psyqualia summon reaches as far as outside Card Capital when Kourin suddenly rides up throws him a helmet & tells him to come with her. Back at the Underground area, Miwa shows up with Misaki and Kamui who both implore Kai to face Aichi in a Vanguard fight and help bring him back to normal. Just as Kai informs them that that is exactly why he is here, Kourin immediately arrives with Aichi. Miwa, Kourin, Misaki and Kamui clear the area to watch the fight from a distance. Kai upsets Aichi when he tells him that he still thinks he is weak, and Aichi vows to prove his strength to Kai as they get ready to begin their fierce battle. Aichi is startled when he realizes Kai is going to fight him with his former Royal Paladin deck. Kai vows to show Aichi the \"true power\" of the deck that he threw away which rattles Aichi even more. Aichi goes first and uses his units' skills to add Blaster Dark who he refers to as his avatar from his deck to his hand. Kai has a flashback of 4 years ago when he lost his parents, was taken in by his uncle, forced to move out of town, and transferred to a different school. There, he meets Ren and Tetsu, who challenges Kai to a cardfight. Tetsu ends up losing to Kai, and he and Ren tell Kai of Team Asteroid. They recruit Kai, and they have a lot of fun until one day Ren's Psyqualia awakened. He beat Tetsu repeatedly, claiming that he was now the \"strongest fighter\" ever. Ren abandoned the idea of him, Tetsu and Kai being Team Asteroid and has begun construction for the new Asteroid Headquarters where only the best fighters would be selected. Kai realizes that Ren has become obsessed with power and refuses to go along with his new plan and quickly challenges him to a cardfight. The match is fierce and as Ren announces his \"Final Turn\", he taunts Kai. But before he can claim victory, his overuse of Psyqualia causes him to collapse. Kai catches him in time but Ren is still fixated on how much stronger he's become. Kai quits the team and moves back home peeved about how powerless he was to stop Ren. Kai reminisces on how refreshing after all of this it was to meet Aichi again and of how much fun Aichi made him remember Vanguard fights used to be. He also remembers how fixated Aichi had become on \"getting stronger\". He vows to himself that while he couldn't stop Ren, this time will be different.

Kai reminds Aichi that his avatar is not Blaster Dark as he claims but will always be Blaster Blade. Kai faces Aichi thinking that this time he's going to teach him what true strength is and declares that he is going to stop him!",
        "Kai heads to the Underground area to await his fateful match with Aichi. Back at home, as Aichi reviews his Shadow Paladin deck, he receives a Psyqualia-induced summon from Ren who is waiting for him at Card Shop PSY. Aichi, led by Ren's Psyqualia summon reaches as far as outside Card Capital when Kourin suddenly rides up throws him a helmet & tells him to come with her. Back at the Underground area, Miwa shows up with Misaki and Kamui who both implore Kai to face Aichi in a Vanguard fight and help bring him back to normal. Just as Kai informs them that that is exactly why he is here, Kourin immediately arrives with Aichi. Miwa, Kourin, Misaki and Kamui clear the area to watch the fight from a distance. Kai upsets Aichi when he tells him that he still thinks he is weak, and Aichi vows to prove his strength to Kai as they get ready to begin their fierce battle. Aichi is startled when he realizes Kai is going to fight him with his former Royal Paladin deck. Kai vows to show Aichi the \"true power\" of the deck that he threw away which rattles Aichi even more. Aichi goes first and uses his units' skills to add Blaster Dark who he refers to as his avatar from his deck to his hand. Kai has a flashback of 4 years ago when he lost his parents, was taken in by his uncle, forced to move out of town, and transferred to a different school. There, he meets Ren and Tetsu, who challenges Kai to a cardfight. Tetsu ends up losing to Kai, and he and Ren tell Kai of Team Asteroid. They recruit Kai, and they have a lot of fun until one day Ren's Psyqualia awakened. He beat Tetsu repeatedly, claiming that he was now the \"strongest fighter\" ever. Ren abandoned the idea of him, Tetsu and Kai being Team Asteroid and has begun construction for the new Asteroid Headquarters where only the best fighters would be selected. Kai realizes that Ren has become obsessed with power and refuses to go along with his new plan and quickly challenges him to a cardfight. The match is fierce and as Ren announces his \"Final Turn\", he taunts Kai. But before he can claim victory, his overuse of Psyqualia causes him to collapse. Kai catches him in time but Ren is still fixated on how much stronger he's become. Kai quits the team and moves back home peeved about how powerless he was to stop Ren. Kai reminisces on how refreshing after all of this it was to meet Aichi again and of how much fun Aichi made him remember Vanguard fights used to be. He also remembers how fixated Aichi had become on \"getting stronger\". He vows to himself that while he couldn't stop Ren, this time will be different.

He learns that not only has Kai's deck been changed to a Narukami deck, but also that Kai has no memory of using a Kagero deck or of Aichi using Royal Paladins. To find some answers, the two have a cardfight. As Aichi struggles to get comfortable with his new Gold Paladin deck, Kai slowly realizes that something is off. Getting his memory back, Kai nonetheless chooses to continue using his current deck, but Aichi is conflicted about using his. Kai tells Aichi that he is bound by his own limits by not wanting to use Gold Paladins and that he needs to break through them. To prove his point, Kai rides Dragonic Kaiser Vermillion, declares \"Final Turn\", and performs Limit Break, an ability that activates when a player has 4 or more damage. With Vermillions Limit Break, Kai attacks all of Aichi's front-row units in one strike and wins as a result. After the battle, Aichi and Kai watch a commercial advertising the Vanguard Fight Circuit, a worldwide invitational tournament which is sponsored by Takuto Tatsunagi, the young boy that Aichi met before and the one responsible for the phenomena of changing their decks. To use the VF Circuit as a way to reach Takuto, Aichi and Kai go their separate paths.

It is ultimately decided to settle things with a cardfight between Aichi and Kamui. If Aichi wins, then Kamui will return to Q4 and enter the VF Circuit. If Kamui wins, then he stays with Handsome. And so, Aichi and Kamui's cardfight ensues. As Aichi tries to get used to his Gold Paladin deck, Kamui puts on the pressure with his slightly-improved Nova Grappler deck, driving Aichi to 5 damage.

Before New Team Asteroid is transported to the next round, Kai informally tells Aichi and Q4 how they must get stronger if they hope to ever cross paths with him again."

Leon attacks him with his vanguard Maelstrom powered up via its Limit Break, and Kamui tries to tag guard for Aichi. However, Leon's drive check reveals a stand trigger, giving his vanguard Maelstrom enough power to penetrate Q4's defenses and win the match for Dreadnought. Shortly afterwards, the two teams argue over the value of losing. Leon asks Aichi about what is the path he takes, and Aichi is reminded to make his own path.

To better prepare the team, Shin recommends for Aichi, Kamui, and Misaki to battle against other stronger, non-Q4-affiliated cardfighters. Aichi takes a look at his Blond Ezel card and is reminded about Kourin, the person who gave it to him. So, Q4 goes to Card Shop PSY and requests for the Ultra Rare girls to cardfight with them for training purposes. They accept, and thus the battles ensue. The first match-up is between Aichi and Kourin, who now uses an Angel Feather deck. Aichi gains the upper hand when he superior rides Pellinore, but Kourin uses her Angel Feathers' skills to swap cards from her damage zone and then calling them. As the fight continues, Kourin antagonistically puts down Aichi by telling him to give up and how he's reached his limits. He proves her wrong and shows his determination when he rides Blond Ezel and activates its Limit Break to defeat her. Despite her harsh words, Kourin is actually glad that Aichi won. Then, the second match-up starts with Kamui against Suiko, who also uses an Angel Feather deck. Although Kamui takes some precaution by not dealing 4 damage to Suiko for fear of Limit Break, she nonetheless plays a card named Doctroid Micros, whose skill is used to purposely give herself 4 damage. Not only can she now activate the Limit Break of her key card, Chief Nurse, Shamsiel, but she also powers up all of her front-row units as well. How will Kamui deal with Suiko's Limit Break?",

Thus, he seals the Aqua Force strategy of launching multiple attacks and Blue Storm Dragon, Maelstroms Limit Break. In spite of Kyou's own Limit Break from his new ace card, Martial Arts Mutant, Master Beetle, Leon overcomes the obstacles against him when he calls more units to replace his rested ones and utilizes the max potential of his Aqua Force clan.

Yuri tries to guard her attack, putting Misaki in the same situation as the last time they fought each other. Misaki decides to take a chance, which pays off when she drive checks a critical and heal trigger, and evens out the damage 4-4. Thanks to Amaterasu and its Limit Break, Misaki ultimately wins. Meanwhile, Kamui continues his battle with Joker X, who rides No Life King, Death Anchor. Kamui defends himself against its terrifying skill with a lot of his cards. On the following turn, Kamui Crossrides Illuminal Dragon and activates its Limit Break to stand his remaining units, thus forcing X to not guard against his attack. Kamui defeats Joker X without ever learning his true identity. Winning every match they had, Q4 is crowned the victor of the Japan Stage. After the awards ceremony, Q4 is led to a room where Takuto Tatsunagi explains everything.

Leon also says he was the one who let the Royal Paladin, Shadow Paladin, and Kagero clans be sealed away by the enemy. His reasons for doing so are to set the Aqua Force clan free (which was also captured by the same foe), restore the Soryu family to its former glory, and then rule the world. Leon's Psyqualia is amplified by the dark powers of the enemy and blows everyone away. Later, after being knocked unconscious, Q4 awakens and speaks with an injured Takuto, who gives more revelations. He discloses the name of the mysterious enemy: Void, an evil power of emptiness that is currently encompassing the majority of Cray and will make its way to Earth if not stopped. Takuto also states that he manipulated everyone's memories to make them forget about the past relating to the 3 sealed clans in order to introduce the new clans, Gold Paladin and Narukami, for Aichi, Kai, and Ren to later use and get stronger for this upcoming battle to free Cray.

        "Months after the conclusion of the VF Circuit, Aichi enters high school as a freshman at Miyaji Academy. However, he has trouble adjusting to his new school life due to the academy's heavy emphasis on studies. After school, Aichi goes to Card Capital while being tailed by a classmate, Naoki Ishida. There, he sees the many customers playing Vanguard, which Naoki has no knowledge about. He spots Aichi conversing with Team SIT Genius in the back of the shop. Curious by how different Aichi's behavior is in the card shop compared to how he acts at school because of a card game, Naoki becomes intrigued to Vanguard. And so, Aichi teaches Naoki about Vanguard through playing an actual match, with the latter being lent a new Narukami trial deck to use from Shin. As they cardfight, Naoki slowly gets immersed into the game. After Aichi eventually wins, Naoki buys the trial deck and hastily leaves in a frustrated manner, which worries Aichi. But he is later comforted by Kai who tells him that Naoki has in fact taken an interest in Vanguard. The next day at school, Aichi is shocked when his class gets a new transfer student: Kourin Tatsunagi from Ultra Rare.",

        "The news of Kourin transferring into Aichi's class becomes a hot topic, especially when the male classmates start talking to Aichi to get closer to her once they learn that the two know each other. Then, Aichi gets an idea on how to promote Vanguard at his school. Because there is no Cardfight Club, Aichi decides to make one himself. The next day, he tries to recruit enough members to officially start the club (needing a minimum of five people, including himself) by handing out leaflets in front of the school. His pleas fall on deaf ears until Kourin agrees to be a member. Her enlistment is followed by several other boys who want to join (only to be with Kourin), but she proposes that anybody who wants to become club members will have to defeat either her and Aichi in cardfights before they can enter. The two easily beat all of the challengers, but then Naoki steps up to play against Kourin with honest feelings of wanting to join the club. With a new Jewel Knight Royal Paladin deck, Kourin battles Naoki, who uses the Eradicator Narukami trial deck he bought a while ago. In the middle of the fight, Naoki reveals that he knew Aichi from when he was in the elementary school division of Miyaji Academy and how he felt guilty for not doing anything to help Aichi who was being bullied at the time. Naoki further explains that seeing how much Aichi has changed because of Vanguard motivated him to find something to be passionate about and ultimately change himself. In the end, Naoki defeats Kourin with the Break Ride ability of Eradicator, Vowing Sword Dragon. With that, Naoki is initiated into the newly formed Cardfight Club, and Aichi's life in high school truly begins.",

The two teams play in a best-of-5 match, and opponents are randomly selected. Under the conditions that Naitou created, if the Cardfight Club loses this match, then it will be dissolved. In the first game, Naoki fights Kai, with both using Eradicator-themed Narukami decks. Naoki combines both the Break Ride of Eradicator, Vowing Sword Dragon and the Limit Break of Eradicator, Gauntlet Buster Dragon to retire Kai's units and gain more critical value and power, but Kai manages to survive the assault. Then, Kai uses a similar devastating combo with Vowing Sword and Eradicator, Dragonic Descendant. Although Naoki blocks his first attempt, Kai activates Descendant's Limit Break to have it stand up, gain another critical, and attack again. Unable to defend this attack, Naoki loses, thus putting Hitsue High up 1-0. For the next fight, Kourin is chosen to battle Izaki (which leaves Morikawa extremely envious).",

        "Kourin defeats Izaki, which ties the score 1-1. The third game pits Misaki against Hitsue Vanguard Club's ringer and old Q4 teammate, Kamui Katsuragi. Although Kamui gets an early lead, Misaki mounts a comeback with Battle Deity of the Night, Artemis. Kamui then combines the Break Ride of Beast Deity, Ethics Buster and the Limit Break of Ultra Beast Deity, Illuminal Dragon to stand four of his rear-guards to launch multiple attacks in one turn. However, Misaki protects herself, only taking one point of damage from Kamui's five attacks. In what seems to be a hopeless situation, Misaki rides Eternal Goddess, Iwanagahime and uses its Limit Break to retire Kamui's front-row units. Weakening Kamui's defenses, Misaki wins and puts Miyaji Academy up 2-1. In the fourth game, Shingo is selected to fight against Miwa. Before the fight, Shingo underestimates Miwa, which ends up being his undoing when Miwa demolishes him and evens the score 2-2. So, it's Aichi vs. Morikawa in the fifth and final game that will decide the fate of the Miyaji Academy Cardfight Club. Given Morikawa's reputation, Misaki thinks that this will be an easy win for Aichi. However, after the two fighters reveal their first vanguards, Aichi is surprised to see Morikawa using Kai's Kagero deck (although Morikawa is not particularly glad about this).",

Although initially mad with using Kai's Kagero deck and not his own, Morikawa nonetheless puts a great amount of pressure on Aichi. All the while, Kai watches the fight as an opportunity to see if his Kagero deck is strong enough against the current Aichi, who strikes back with the Break Ride of Solitary Liberator, Gancelot to empower itself and his rear-guards. Morikawa defends and makes it to his next turn, in which he rides Dragonic Overlord the End.

Aichi emerges victorious over Morikawa, meaning that the Miyaji Academy Cardfight Club wins the intramural match.

        "After Naoki makes another offhand comment towards Suiko, the two start their cardfight. Suiko criticizes Naoki for being a good but uninteresting fighter. He tries to prove her wrong when he activates the Limit Break of his new ace card: Armor Break Dragon. At the cost of discarding three cards from his hand, Naoki not only eliminates Suiko's front-row rear-guard units, but he also increases Armor Break Dragons power and critical value to unbelievable heights. Despite this, Suiko defends against Naoki's attacks with almost all of the cards in her hand. On the following turn, Suiko wins the game with Chief Nurse, Shamsiel by moving cards to and from her damage zone thus increasing most of her units' power. Afterwards, Naoki apologizes to his friends for his loss and realizes how weak he actually is. Shingo cheers him up (although with some harsh choice of words) and says that he'll train Naoki to become stronger. Then, Ren Suzugamori appears and is revealed to be the captain of Fukuhara High's Vanguard Club. Ren suggests to have a match with Aichi, showing him a glimpse of his reversioned Shadow Paladin deck. But this turns out to be a tease from Ren, who retracts his match request and dismisses everyone. As the Miyaji Cardfight Club and Team Dreadnought leave Fukuhara High, Leon tells Aichi that if he wants to fight Dreadnought at the VF High School Championship, then he will have to first defeat Fukuhara High at the regional qualifying tournament.",

However, she is cheered on by Misaki and subsequently the audience to not give up. Kourin regains her composure and tries to end the game with the Limit Break of Leading Jewel Knight, Salome.

In the waiting room, the club sees Fukuhara's and Hitsue's Vanguard teams. In particular, Hitsue's team has a surprisingly strong look of determination to win the entire tournament. The first round pits Miyaji Academy against Hitsue High in a best-of-3 match. In the first game, Kai defeats Shingo, which puts Hitsue up 1-0. The second game features Miwa vs. Misaki. For the sake of his teammates, the typically-carefree Miwa goes all out with the Limit Break of Hellfire Seal Dragon, Blockade Inferno to retire all of Misaki's grade 2 rear-guards and gain a significant amount of power. Misaki completely defends herself, but she is left with a weakened battle formation. Nonetheless, on her next turn, Misaki rides Goddess of Good Luck, Fortuna and reassembles her forces. She also activates Fortunas Limit Break to perform three drive checks and manages to get two drive triggers to increase her overall power, ultimately winning the game and tying the score 1-1. For the third and final game that will decide which team will advance through the tournament, Aichi and Izaki must fight each other.",

This move allows Naoki to retire all of Aichi's rear-guards and increase his overall attack power. Determined to return Naoki to his former self, Aichi withstands Naoki's assault and rides Wolf Fang Liberator, Garmore on the following turn. He uses its Limit Break to superior call more units from his deck to refill his entire field, winning the game for Aichi. Naoki collapses and then gets up but with no memory of what just happened. Moreover, when Kai picks up the Vowing Saber Dragon \"Reverse\" card, it mysteriously vanishes."

Takuto explains that it is the work of Reverse, a phenomenon created by the evil Void in its quest to envelop everything in darkness. He further elucidates that those who are Reversed will lose their souls and become engulfed with Void's energy if they lose to a Reversed fighter. It is then revealed that Takuto has been Reversed and is now an agent for Void.

One day, Yuri and Gai were scouting for a third member for their as-of-yet unnamed team until Kenji, who was a weak player at the time, offered to play against her. Despite Kenji losing to both her and Gai, Yuri decided to make him the third member of the team, being oddly drawn to him. As time went on, Kenji's skills improved through hard work, and the team, now known as Caesar, won the Japanese Vanguard National Championship. Yuri also gave her medal to Kenji which he wears around his neck to this day. Apalled by how different Kenji is now, Yuri tries to finish the match with a Break Ride combo as she cries out for Kenji to return to his former self. However, Kenji survives her attacks while ignoring her pleads. He eventually wins using \"Reverse\" Daiyusha and succumbs Yuri to Reverse."

Emi expresses her thanks to Kamui, which causes him to run off in embarassment. At the front of the school, he runs into Maki and Kourin who have just arrived from the camping trip. Kourin gives a troubling look towards Kamui as an airplane flies overhead..."

He quickly deals 5 damage to Kourin, who responds by using the card that she could not bring herself to use against Aichi during the camping trip: Broken Heart Jewel Knight, Ashley \"Reverse\". She uses its devastating Limit Break to retire Kamui's units while increasing her own forces to eventually overpower and defeat Kamui. Meanwhile, Kai returns to Japan and is escorted by Takuto's assistant until he sees Miwa. Aichi and his classmates finally return to Miyaji Academy where Aichi sees Kamui reeling from his loss to Kourin and about to become Reversed. While Aichi and his friends try to understand the situation, Takuto appears in a live worldwide broadcast in which he announces the beginning of the world's destruction.",

        "Continuing his broadcast which is only visible to cardfighters, Takuto reveals everything about Reverse and the black rings in the sky scattered around the world. He explains that those are gates which grow with each fighter becoming Reversed, eventually enveloping the entire world in darkness. At the end of the broadcast, as Aichi and his friends come to grips with this revelation, Kamui finally succumbs to Reverse and challenges Aichi. Soon becoming overwhelmed by an increased number of Reversed fighters, Aichi and his friends escape along with Gouki, Nagisa, Emi, Mai, and Rekka thanks to the timely arrival of Shin. Elsewhere, Miwa fights Kai using the latter's Kagero deck in an attempt to open his eyes. However, his efforts end in vain as Kai defeats him with Star-vader, Chaos Breaker Dragon while also telling Miwa that he became Reversed of his own volition to become as strong as Aichi and Ren. At Card Capital, Aichi and his friends decide to confront Takuto for information. Suddenly, Miwa, now Reversed, appears and tells them that they will have to fight Kai before getting to Takuto. He also tells Aichi that he and Ren are what drove Kai to becoming Reversed in the first place. After Miwa takes his leave, everyone resolves themselves to press onward, but Aichi is showing signs of hesitation after what Miwa said...",
