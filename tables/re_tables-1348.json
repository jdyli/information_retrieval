As First Lady, she remained in the upstairs living quarters of the White House only coming downstairs just once, to attend the wedding of her daughter Elizabeth in January 1842. On the evening of September 10, 1842, the First Lady died peacefully. At the time of her death, she was 51 years old, making her the youngest First Lady to die. John and Letita Tyler's children were the following: Mary Tyler-Jones, Robert Tyler (who served as the President's private secretary at the White House), John Tyler III, Letitia Tyler-Semple, Elizabeth Tyler-Waller (marrying William N. Waller at a White House wedding in 1842), Alice Tyler-Denison, and Tazewell Tyler. The second First Lady was Julia, who at age 24, married the President at the age of 54 on June 26, 1844. John and Julia's children were the following: David Gardiner Tyler, John \"Alex\" Alexander Tyler, Julia Gardiner Tyler-Spencer, Lachlan Gardiner Tyler, Lyon Gardiner Tyler, Robert \"Fitz\" Fitzwalter Tyler, and Pearl Tyler-Ellis."

Though, they're considered to be the three least dedicated students, the trio's potential and good nature comes to an advantage, when they run late for class one afternoon. It just so happens, that day, Lothor, a banished evil ninja, comes back to the planet, and conquers every Ninja Academy with his hoard of Evil Alien Ninjas! and makes their Sensei trapped in the form of a Guinea Pig, and his grumpy and embittered tech-wizard son Cam designing the weaponry to combat the villains, the three become the Wind Ninja Rangers.

The ship's mechanic Damon, along with Alpha 6, doesn't think that the ship will fly as it has been out of action for so long. But after a while Damon lends a helping hand and the Astro Megaship is flying once again and they find another wormhole and go through it. Meanwhile Leo has caught up with Mike, Maya and Kendrix.

During the fight with Scorpius, Mike takes the Quaser Saber out of the rock with great ease, which then prompts Maya, Kai, Kendrix and Damon to do the same, also with great ease, showing that they are the chosen ones. Furious that he cannot have the Quaser Sabers, Furio turns the whole of Mironoi into stone, along with the people of Mironoi. Mike, Leo, Kai, Damon, Maya and Kendrix manage to escape, but then Furio appears and creates a huge chasm in the ground, leaving Mike hanging on to the side of the wall.

The Megaship escapes just as Mirinoi turns to stone, and takes the new Rangers back to Terra Venture, which sets off on its long journey.

Damon leaves Matthew and morphs with the rest of the Rangers, leaving Matthew to fend for himself when he is under attack by Furio and Sting Wingers. Matthew runs into the control base to look for help when he finds everyone is asleep. Ripping his suit, Matthew uses the rest of his willpower to lock Furio and the Sting Wingers in the lift. Meanwhile the Galactabeasts arrive and suck up the gas but are turned to stone in the process. Wanting to restore their friends, the Rangers infuse the Galactabeasts with the power of the Transdaggers. Using this, not only are the Galactabeasts restored but also gain the ability to transform into Galactazords. Using the new Galaxy Megazord, Gasser is quickly destroyed. Matthew is awarded a medal for his heroism, but all the boy wants is to return home. As a thank you for helping out, the Rangers decide to take him in the Astro Megaship.",

Leo goes after them and finds the box, but Mike isn't in there. The other Rangers come and find Leo watching Furio and Trakeena; they make a plan which gives Leo a chance to free Mike. Mike tells Leo of the Lights Of Orion and that they need to get them before Furio can. They go to the cave where they are kept, Leo finds the box, but then is attacked by Mike afterwards who takes the box and leaves Leo in the cave alone. Mike turns out to be a monster named Mutantrum who then gives the box to Furio, but is stopped by Leo. Mutantrum grows and the Rangers call upon their megazord for help, who destroys the monster.

The battle leads to the storage area, where Deviot grabs Trakeena and plunges into the coccoon with her. Villamax helplessly watches. A single being emerges. Trakeena and Deviot have fused into one! It is mostly Trakeena, with a few shades of Deviot. With only one good engine left, Stanton decides that the colony must land. He shows high command, and the citizens, a new, nearby world he has discovered, prefect for human life. As Terra Venture prepares to land, it is attacked by the Scorpion Stinger. It blasts away at the lesser domes. Leo gets an idea. He and Damon steal a case of explosives from a Terra Venture cargo truck. Damon lures the Scorpion Stinger into following him as he runs down one of the access tubes. The Stinger's pinchers nearly miss Damon while Leo sneaks up on a pincer and plants the explosive on it. Both Rangers make tracks as it counts down. The bomb blows up in the Stinger's face, hurling it off into space, away from the colony. With all engines destroyed, Terra Venture is forced to crash land on a moon. The main city dome detaches, as the rest is destroyed. The citizens of the colony try to pick up the pieces from the crash. But they aren't safe yet - the dome is cracking. The dome won't hold out much longer, and the city is nearly in ruins. The ship is dying, and Commander Stanton makes a command decision to evacuate Terra Venture. Trakeena prepares her Sting Wingers for a massive invasion. Each Winger has explosives strapped to it. Hordes of them will self-destruct and destroy anything they latch onto. Everyone is rounded up into shuttles to begin evacuation to the new world. Trakeena gleefully watches as Terra Venture nears its doom.",

The Stinger rams the Astro Megaship, and grabs it in its pinchers, causing severe damage. The Rangers have no choice but to have the ship self-destruct, and escape on the Jammers. The Rangers just barely clear the explosion, but it sends Alpha and Leo hurlinginto space. The explosion sends the Stinger reeling, and it crash lands on the moon, near the city dome. The shuttles have safely made it to the new world, and the passengers rejoice. The Rangers land on the new world, and find Alpha crash landed in some bushes. However, there is no sign of Leo as he has crashed onto the moon, near the Scorpion Stinger and the city dome. He tries to radio his teammates, but he is out of range. Trakeena staggers around in the wreckage of the Scorpion Stinger. She makes it to the storage chamber, and prepares to enter the coccoon."

        "Trakeena uses the coccoon, and emerges as a slimy insectoid monster. Down on the new world, the Rangers continue searching for Leo. Leo finds the Scorpion Stinger, and follows Trakeena's slime trail all the way to the city dome. Trakeena spikes her staff into the ground, energizing everything, and powering up the city dome. The city dome lifts off, and heads for the new world to destroy the camp set up by the people. Leo finds Trakeena, and the two battle it out. Leo is no match against Trakeena's new powers. When the Rangers find out that Leo is in the city dome, they fly there on the Jammers and help him fight Trakeena. They unleash the Quasar Launchers, but they are of no use - Trakeena easily deflects the blast back at them. Maya and Karone grab a hold of Trakeena and set her up for an attack by Leo in his Capsular Cycle. The attack tosses Trakeena aside, but she is still not down. Leo puts on his armor and grabs Trakeena with a claw. He pulls her in close and fires at point blank range. The explosion seemingly destroys both Trakeena and the Red Ranger. The Rangers think Leo has been killed, but he crawls out of the wreckage. The city dome is still headed for the camp on the new world, and the Rangers have no idea how to stop it! The Galaxy Megazord finally appears, and steers the city dome away from a collision course with the camp. It crashes in the distance, and explodes. Just as the people begin to think that the Rangers are dead, they emerge from the smoke with their Galactabeasts, alive and kicking. As the Rangers head towards camp, the people run towards the Rangers, and congratulate their saviors on a job well done. The Galactabeasts call the Rangers into the forest, where Maya makes a surprising discovery - they have landed on Mirinoi! With their quest completed, the Rangers find the stone and the place the Quasar Sabers back into it. The energy from the Sabers restores the people of Mirinoi, who had been previously turned to stone by Furio. Kendrix returns as well She thanks Karone for filling in for her. Everyone celebrates under the fireworks, even the Galactabeasts. A new world, a new beginning.",

They're ordered to have their minds erased of their adventures in the past so they can adjust back to their lives in their own time. They're not willing to give up their memories, and decide to go back to help their friend. Jen gives Alex back her engagement ring. After Eric is badly injured, Wes is left alone to fight the Cyclobot army, armed with the Quatum Morpher and Quantum Defender (given to him by Eric). As the battle rages with Ransik's army, the other Rangers arrive in the Megazord and defeat Doomtrom with the Cyclone Defense. After the Rangers defeat the Cyclobot army, Wes, now in control of Q-Rex, upgrades its Trizarium Crystal with the Quantum Defender, stopping the time disruptions and allowing him to use it on Doomtron and Frax, destroying them both. Nadira Starts Crying over Frax. The Rangers then battle Ransik, but are overpowered. During the fight, Ransik accidentally shoots Nadira, who is protecting a baby after having changed her opinion on humans thanks to Trip and uses the baby to convince Ransik that humans aren't so bad after all. Ransik surrenders to the Rangers without further fight and the Rangers have to return to the future without Wes to their great sadness. Then Jen and Wes confess their feelings that they love each other. With the Rangers gone, Mr. Collins offers Wes command of the Silver Guardians who will protect the city without doing it for profit anymore. Wes agrees as long as Eric is his co-commander, which he agrees to.",

        "Somewhere in the wilderness, a young man named Cole leaves a tribe to search for his past. In the city of Turtle Cove, four Rangers are battling two powerful orgs, but are outmatched. The orgs leave, and Alyssa comments on how they need a fifth Ranger, but their leader Taylor disagrees. Cole arrives in the city and tries to find the people in his photo - his parents. He ends up saving animals from a shady shelter run by two devious clowns. Cole and the animals make it out of the shelter safely, and the animal snatchers are revealed to be the duke orgs Toxica and Jindrax. The four Rangers find Cole in the city and ask him to come with them. Taylor ends up punching him in the gut, and they haul him away unconscious. Cole wakes up to find himself in a jungle, and he is greeted by five robotic animals - Lion, Tiger, Bison, Shark, and Eagle - the Power Animals. Cole then makes his way to a temple, where he is greeted by the four Rangers and their mentor, Princess Shayla. Cole shows the team a red crystal with the lion spirit in it. They surprise him by showing him their own colored crystals. The Org from earlier returns to wreak more havoc in the city. Shayla dispatches the Rangers. Taylor gives Cole his Growl Phone and shows him how to morph. The Rangers, are still unable to defeat the orgs. They combine their weapons into the Jungle Sword, destroying one org. Jindrax and Toxica appear. Toxica grows the other org into a giant. The wild zords come to help the Rangers and destroy the org. Another mission complete, but what will they face next?",

Tire Org manages to stall Taylor, Danny, and Max, giving him time to dash over to Cole, Alyssa, and Princess Shayla. He kidnaps the princess, and the Rangers try to run after him.
