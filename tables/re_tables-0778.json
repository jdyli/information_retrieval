        "With the addition of more humans, his forces being decimated by the mysterious youth with a Fusion Loader of his own, a livid MadLeomon decides to rectify this turn of events. Taken by Shoutmon to see the Village of Light, Mikey and his friends encounter Jijimon and learn of the Bagra Army before the village is being bombed by a Pteranomon. While Mikey DigiFuses Pickmon Slingshot for Shoutmon and Ballistamon to use to take out the Pteranomon, Angie briefly encounters Cutemon and Dorulumon before being found by Mikey and telling him to to help her find a way return to their world. Fearing his chances of becoming king of the Digi World would be gone if Mikey leaves, Shoutmon attempts to discourage the boy's departure by treating Mikey to a party and then reminding him of his sense of responsibility. However, revealing the presence of other humans and getting upset with Angie while admitting his reasons for Mikey to stay, Shoutmon ends up screwing things up as Mikey ends their friendship and heads into the forest with his friends the next morning.

Though Shoutmon and Ballistamon come to their rescue with Starmon and the Pickmons getting to safety, the children watch as MadLeomon absorbs Orochimon to become MadLeomon Orochi Mode and pulverize the two Digimon.

They are taken to the cells, where they learn from a Prairiemon that Cutemon's parents had already been transferred to a different facility. Elsewhere, Tactimon is informed by a Troopmon that Mikey and Dorulumon were captured in the Magma Zone. The Fusion Fighters start to dig their way through the walls, motivating Dorulumon and the other prisoners to help them.

They took the first 90 minute shift, taking over the service from professional chefs with all prep work done and a clean kitchen, followed by the Blue Team. Overall, Red performed well, delivering two outstanding dishes but struggling with time management and a \"disastrous\" Club Sandwich (the lounge's signature dish). Despite all of Blue's dishes being on time and producing an excellent Club Sandwich, it was their fish, both raw and burnt, that lost them the challenge.",

They faced a \"Fix Your Biggest Stuff-up\" Challenge in which they had to re-invent a bad dish they cooked earlier in the competition. For Ellie it was a dish from episode 31 and for Alana it was both her dishes from episode 47. Ellie got 75 minutes like in the original challenge, Alana only got 45. Ellie left the capsicums out of her dish and turned it into a dessert, while Alana decided only to improve the weak points of the original dishes, being raw lamb and crunchy, undercooked pear. Ultimately, Alana's decision to leave the fat on her lamb cutlets did not go well with the judges, but her Poached Pear dessert was deemed faultless. Ellie's eggy Cr\u00e8me Caramel and the pith left on the orange wedges in her Citrus Salad were enough to lead to a teary elimination.",

The recipes would then be tested by four home cooks who had to follow the recipe to the letter. They were paired up with a contestant in the studio and had to cook the dish along with them within 90 minutes, so their version of the dish could be judged by how much it tasted like the contestants' original recipes. All contestants ran into trouble with mistakes in their recipes or processes that proved too complicated for home cooks, except for winner Michael, who had written a recipe that was so easy to follow that Sue, the home cook assigned to him, even managed to cook a better version of his dish according to Matt Preston.",

Since no one seems to have the key, the girls start looking for it all around the place, which quickly sets Amber B. in bad mood. She takes a stick and breaks a glass door at the back of the mansion.

Eventually, the girls head to a bar to celebrate their new home, but they get kicked out of several places for fighting with Kayla being the core of trouble. The next day, Amber M. accidentally offends Ailea who later instigates a huge scandal against Amber. She apologizes, and everything is forgiven for the first time. Not wanting any drama this time, the girls go out to dinner. There, strangers start making comments that upset Kayla.

She also opens up about her tough childhood, but Tiffany and Whitney console and ensure her that they are true friends from now on. The next day, the separation in the house becomes somewhat defined: the Ambers set up 'The Amber Show', where they gossip about the girls in the confessional, especially Ailea.

Kayla is low on money so she wants to by any means earn as much as she can and she is buying extra underwear for a bonus. Amber M. decides to get the bonus herself so she pays more, depriving Kayla of it and upsetting her. In the evening, the girls go out. The Ambers get into an altercation with locals in a bathroom and tell the girls about it. This escalates into a huge street fight. Tiffany gets especially mad and shouts at the enemies from the top of the limo. Embarrassed by her behavior later on, Tiffany vows to never act like that anymore. Influenced by the latest events, the girls want no more drama. Therefore, Whitney, Tiffany, Sarah and Ailea go to a bar to have fun, while the Ambers and Kayla go to a quiet restaurant. Drama doesn't let the latter move around, though, because Kayla refuses to give a lot of tips. Amber M. and Kayla argue and consequently fight in the car, making Amber B. pull over. The fight goes on outside, involving the girls even choking each other. At home, the girls start discussing the situation, but Kayla is sent packing. Notes: Kayla was removed from the house.",

Kayla is low on money so she wants to by any means earn as much as she can and she is buying extra underwear for a bonus. Amber M. decides to get the bonus herself so she pays more, depriving Kayla of it and upsetting her. In the evening, the girls go out. The Ambers get into an altercation with locals in a bathroom and tell the girls about it. This escalates into a huge street fight. Tiffany gets especially mad and shouts at the enemies from the top of the limo. Embarrassed by her behavior later on, Tiffany vows to never act like that anymore.
