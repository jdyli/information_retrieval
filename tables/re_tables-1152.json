Nixon and McAllister investigate when the stolen digger turns up at a transport site. Manson's tip-offs regarding Trevor Little and his gang are proven correct, but nobody else knows that Manson's information is coming from Beech - that is until the arrival of DI Peter Cavanaugh, an Australian cop on attachment to the NCIS, who sets hearts a-flutter - and Meadows is furious when Manson's liaisons with Beech are revealed. Sun Hill's CID and SO19 lie in wait for Trevor Little's gang to pull off the diamond robbery - but when the raid is aborted at the last minute, Beech's information to Manson isn't looking so kosher. Meadows warns Manson away from Beech, but Manson goes to see him again when he is beaten up in prison."

        "Realising that Beech has the only evidence that could incriminate Cavanaugh, Meadows is forced to have to rely on the slippery Beech - but Okaro insists he is their only choice. Meanwhile, realising what he is up to, Sam goes undercover, posing that she has been suspended - so that she can flee with Cavanaugh and keep tracks on him at all times. Using her mobile as a tracking device, Meadows and his team close in - but when Cavanaugh realises he's been betrayed, he takes her hostage. Meanwhile, Manson and Hunter accompany Beech to obtain further evidence to nail Cavanaugh - and keep their end of the deal by giving Beech a transfer to a Category C prison. When they arrive at his house, Beech introduces his girlfriend - Maggie Black - who has the incriminating tapes against Cavanaugh. Beech asks Manson if he can have ten minutes alone to \"say goodbye\" to Maggie, before he is escorted back to prison. Manson foolishly agrees, and when Hunter goes to interrupt their little liaison, he finds himself held at gunpoint. When he awakens, he finds Manson tied up - and Beech gone.",
