        "Joseph and Emmanuelle seek Tamara at the New Cap equivalent of the Adama home, but the apartment is inhabited by a drug addict \u2013 an \"amphead\". As the druggie yields the information that Joseph's daughter is at a club called \"Mysteries,\" a gang of drug dealers burst in on the scene and threaten to end his New Cap gamelife. Emmanuelle then takes out the whole team with her pistol, and berates him for freezing up. Daniel tries to communicate with Zoe but without success, and later constructs a pyre around her. Although Zoe is agonized by memories of being trapped in a burning house when she was 5, she does not reveal herself.

Earlier, it is revealed that Daniel's financial troubles are worsening, and he must sell the Buccaneers. Worse still, the army also knows the chip was stolen, and have given him only a week to finish the project. The powerplay between Clarice and Barnabas also heats up, as both jostle for local STO dominance. Daniel orders the chip irradiated and Philo reluctantly undertakes his orders, but just as he does Zoe reveals herself to him and when he panics is forced to kill him, she then steals a van and speeds away. On V-world, a fixated Joseph finally finds his daughter's avatar with the help of Emmanuelle (revealed as his assistant Evelyn). But Tamara shoots herself, and then her father, so that he can't come back to New Cap City, and is finally forced to come to terms with her death.

Daniel then asks Sam to help him - at first Sam refuses, but after seeing a T-shirt of the Avenging Angels, he decides to go in to save his brother any more grief. Amanda finally tells Daniel that she is a mole in Clarice's house and later meets Duram \u2013 who wants Amanda to switch Clarice's holoband.

After the handover, Duram is shot by an unseen sniper - Amanda runs to save his life, but cannot find Clarice's holoband.

Jahrhunderte schon freuen sich in seinem hellen Strahle, und immer weiter gie\u00dft es sich bis in die fernsten Tale. Wo Finsternis und Gram einst lag, da gl\u00e4nzt nun sonnenhell der Tag.

Neues, allgewaltges Streben wogt im Land des Lichtes auf, seinem raschen Siegeslauf folgt ein allbegl\u00fcckend Leben. Gutenberg, der gro\u00dfe Mann, hat dies hehre Werk getan. Ob die Finsternis sich wehrt, ob sie f\u00fchret tausend Streiche, ob sie w\u00fctet, sich emp\u00f6rt, sie erblasst, sie sinkt als Leiche, doch gekr\u00f6nt als Siegesheld, steht das Licht vor aller Welt.

        "The episode opens up again at the Zanzibar fortress as Tucker and Caboose are attempting to teach English to the Alien. Church and Tucker get into a small debate on whether they should teach the alien English or learn his language. Tucker is convinced that they should teach English to the Alien and even had created some visual aids. As it turns out, Tucker was able to get the writing supplies from Caboose's gun which apparently contained crayons instead of bullets. However, when Tucker activates his energy sword to cut the poster boards, the Alien jumps over and attacks him. Despite Tucker's cries for help, Church watches the Alien as it attacks Tucker in order to \"evaluate\" his fighting style. Back at Blood Gulch, Simmons is at the Blue base with Sheila close by. He attempts to contact the Red Base, but is greeted with Donut on the line, who tries to impersonate an answering machine. Simmons attempts to get Sarge on the line, but Donut, under instructions from an off-screen Sarge, denies Simmons from communicating with Sarge, even after he informed Donut that he had captured the Blue Base and Sheila. Eventually Donut hangs up on Simmons, but not before letting Simmons know that he really enjoys his new job as Sarge's right-hand man. Simmons then declares that he will kill all the Reds and tells Sheila to \"lock and load\". Back at Zanzibar, Tex talks with Andy. Tex, through some bluffing and mild threats of blowing up Andy with a remote detonator, convinces him to help her translate what the alien is saying. This, however, doesn't stop Andy from making rude jokes about Tex acting more male than female.",

        "At Zanzibar, Tex and Church argue over whether to let Andy translate what the Alien is saying. Church is concerned that Andy's lack of manners could upset the alien even further. Eventually, Church relents and agrees to this arrangement out of his curiosity as to what could happen. During this whole conversation the Alien is still beating Tucker to a pulp. At Blood Gulch, the Reds are fracturing even more as Donut is unsuccessful in asking Grif to return to their base. Grif refuses, believing Sarge simply wants him to do work, and not just eat ice cream. In reality, Sarge did want Grif to help him eat some of the ice cream that he found. Simmons\u2014now painted mostly blue\u2014plays out his vengeance on the Reds. At first he attempts to cause the Reds to be jealous of him; he soon gives up and orders Sheila to attack the Red base. At Zanzibar, with Andy acting as a translator, the Alien reveals that he came to retrieve the energy sword that Tucker found. It was part of the sacred quest that he was on, but the sword has now locked itself to Tucker as he was the first to find and use it; this explains why Tex was unable to use the sword. As a result, Tucker must join the Alien on its quest. If Tucker refuses, the alien will destroy the base and slaughter everyone in it.",

After the Alien explains the lands that he and Tucker will travel through, Church informs Tucker (the fighter) that Caboose (the wizard), Andy (the archer), and the alien (the healer) will be the team that goes out on this quest. Though this quest is pretty much a suicide mission, Tucker does warn Church that he better hope that Tucker survives, or he will be forced to take care of any children that Tucker might have. At Blood Gulch, Simmons' attack on the Red Base continues. However, he has been so indoctrinated with hatred of the Blues that all of his insults and attack orders confuse the words Red and Blue.

        "The last episode of season 4 begins as Doc tries to convince an incredulous Church of Tucker's pregnancy. When Doc discloses the truth to Tucker, he does not believe him either, thinking he himself has impregnated someone and invents excuses. Caboose enters the base with the skull, asking for help, proclaiming that Andy is dead. After Caboose explains how he found the skull, Church decides to leave the base. Meanwhile, Andy plays back the message from Command in English for the Reds. After hearing the generic instructions, Sarge becomes depressed, and while Grif tries to cheer him up, Donut spots Church approaching with Sheila. Sheila then fires, frightening the Red Team, which regroups behind a rock formation. Sarge calls for reinforcements, and Simmons attempts to negotiate a surrender from the Blues. Annoyed, Church explains what has just occurred back at his base. To Church's dismay, Andy lets slip that it is possible for Tucker to be pregnant, as the Alien's race propagates by infecting other life-forms with parasitic embryos. Caboose then calls Church to inform him that O'Malley has moved to another host as the Reds had been using their radios, and that Tucker had his baby. Higher-pitched Alien speech can be heard off-screen. Church returns to Blue Base, and Donut follows him, wanting to see the baby. Sarge stops him, and orders him to wait for the ship being sent by Command. Donut argues that it could be weeks, even months before the ship arrives. A ship then promptly lands on top of Donut.",

        "Tracy is offered a job in London to become a full-time reporter but she has to write a test article on the kids in care. When she tells the kids, they lose their tempers and refuse to help her because they all want her to stay. Mike asks Cam to consider fostering one of the other kids if Tracy leaves but Cam says she can't if Tracy doesn't get the job because the kids won't co-operate. Johnny overhears this conversation and wants to be fostered by Cam so he and Tee help Tracy. Lily refuses to help as she thinks that if Tracy goes; then she can't get back with Poppy and Rosie. Johnny confronts Lily and tells her Tee will help Tracy Lily then comes back with 'You don't decide what Tee does' and then they argue until Johnny says 'Just cos' you lost your sister don't start poking your nose in with mine' Lily gets mad and starts hitting Johnny. But unlike in 'Drained' Where Johnny retaliates when Carmen attacks him, he doesn't lay a finger to Lily. Instead he looks really upset with what he's done. Eventually, every child helps Tracy in secrecy so no other children know. Tracy takes the article to the Editor who gives her the job. Surprisingly, Tracy turns down the job, claiming that the Dumping Ground is the place she wants to be, saying that she would miss the kids too much. Despite this, the article is published in the newspaper,and the kids realise they all helped, and Tracy is welcomed back to the Dumping Ground once more.

Auggie and Annie determine that Seth, Joan's old flame and recovery acquaintance, was part of a phone conversation with Henry and the oil people.

Arthur admits to Annie and Auggie that the alleged affair is a ruse to protect Joan from involvement in Arthur's problems, but Auggie knows more about this than he is yet telling Annie.

        "Auggie learns that Henry was behind Calder's promotion. Calder sends Annie to Vienna to establish a business relationship with an arms dealer named Stavros, replacing Auggie with himself as her handler and forbidding the two lovers to communicate. Annie proceeds with Calder's plan to buy some missile launchers from Stavros, until she aborts the mission when she finds Calder's proposed \"terrorist buyer\" to be inadequate. Stavros sends his man to kill her, but she is rescued by Teo, who was notified by Auggie on his secret untraceable phone. Annie offers Teo as a buyer and the deal is concluded, but Teo then kills Stavros and his man, destroys the secret phone, and leaves, possibly with some of the launchers. Annie tells Calder she killed the men in self-defense. Back in Washington, her reunion with Auggie is interrupted by Henry, who requests a meeting to tell Annie that Seth's body has been found.",

        "Annie changes her appearance and travels to Geneva, where she rents an apartment and join's Sana's grief support group. After a few weeks, Sana has befriended her and given her a job with her fiance's consulting firm. But one of that firm's potential clients turns out to be \"Goodman\", the agent of Henry's who framed Teo for the helicopter attack. He recognizes Annie, but she is able to attack and subdue him before he can text Henry. As she is loading Goodman into the trunk of his car, Sana stops her at gunpoint. Annie at least temporarily convinces Sana to work with her, and they bring Goodman to Annie's apartment. She begins an enhanced interrogation while Goodman mocks her technique. As she is about to escalate to electric shock, Sana interrupts the interrogation and inadvertently allows Goodman to escape, until he is fatally shot in the ensuing fight with Annie. Annie and Sana then clean the apartment and flee. Meanwhile, in Washington, only Calder and Auggie know that Annie is still alive, and they plot to drive a wedge between Henry and the new DCS, Braithwaite. Joan returns to work in an obscure CIA office, and Arthur is released to house arrest to be with her.",

She cannot break into the laptop without help, but the flash drive contains \"evidence\" linking Sana's fiance David to the helicopter attack. Without consulting Sana, Annie launches her plot against Henry by planting the evidence on David's computer, whereupon he is taken away for questioning by Interpol. Annie then gets an angry Sana to beg Henry to come to Geneva, where she interrupts their meeting by texting Henry on Goodman's phone. As Goodman, she extorts a large sum of money from Henry, in the hope of identifying his financial network. But just as Henry is about to transfer the money, he learns that Goodman is dead. He finds and confronts Sana (while Annie hides and observes), threatening her and also saying that he will find and kill the \"Jessica Matthews\" who led her to betray him. Sana then breaks off cooperation with Annie, saying that she has become a monster like Henry. In Washington, Joan notices Auggie talking to Calder in the building (to advance their plot to split Henry and Braithwaite) and she confronts him, but he does not reveal that Annie is alive. Arthur and Joan send Helen to Geneva to find out more about Henry. She visits Auggie before leaving, saying she still loves him.

        "The failed drone strike on Khalid produces immediate political fallout, with Arthur being called before a Senate hearing that day. Joan sends Annie home and then back to the CIA farm, but her trip is interrupted by information from Eyal that Khalid is targeting Megan. Upon arriving at Megan's safe house, Annie finds that Megan has disappeared . . . and also that she has been tailed by Eyal. She accepts his help when they learn that Khalid's enforcer Griffin Cole has apparently kidnapped Megan. Auggie's technical team concludes that Mossad faked the photo in the intelligence package, and Joan confronts Rivka, who blames the falsified information on Eyal. Annie asks Eyal, and, after she tells him what Rivka said, he admits to it, despite Annie's disbelief. During the Senate hearing, Arthur notices a possible link between the Mossad intelligence and an Israeli agricultural official. Eyal and Annie locate Cole's brother, who tells them that Cole had merely given Megan a plane ticket to meet Khalid but had never kidnapped her. After Cole captures Annie, Eyal kills him. Joan tells Arthur that she intends to take some time off and reprieves Annie from going to the CIA farm. Arthur learns that Henry Wilcox is being given immediate early release from prison and decides to visit him before his release.

There she and Eyal resolve to find Khalid together. With some help from Joan, they plan to identify and track a courier taking money to Khalid from his father. They discover the courier is Megan, who is killed immediately after rejecting Annie's help, but the killer leaves the money behind.
