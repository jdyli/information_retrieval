The El Facil government is wary of Yang being outside of their field of control, thus they refuse to let Yang lead the next operation. Effectively Yang has become a bargaining ship for controlling the excesses of his subordinates. Yang speaks with Konev about the possibility of Phezzan's aid. December, 799 S.C. / 1 N.I.C.: The El Facil fleet, under Merkatz launches for Iserlohn. During the same time, the last of the Alliance fleet launches for their final sortie."

Reinhard asks Hildegard for her advice: shes thinks they are in fact sent by Phezzan and will try to abduct someone, probably the young Emperor. later, she pays a visit to Annerose von Gr\u00fcnewald (Reinhard's elder sister) and persuades her to let Reinhard increase the security measures. Reinhard summons Boltik, the Commissioner of Phezzan, tells him he knows everything about their plan, and asks what is Phezzan's interest: Boltik answers that Phezzan expects to control the space communications and trade in an unified Empire.
