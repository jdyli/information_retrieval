Meanwhile, Booth and Brennan are called to the scene where a man's body was found gutted, burned and hung like a scarecrow on the roof of a hotel that housed Federal witnesses. Booth determines the victim was a snitch working in an organized crime syndicate. Brennan's brother, Russ, informs her of a phone call he received from their father, warning him they are both in danger.

When Booth suspects a dead, former hit man (Hugh Kennedy) is apparently alive, he contacts the bounty hunter who found what was left of his remains (a severed leg). When Booth travels to Baltimore to find the hit man, he gets knocked unconscious and tied up by Kennedy himself, but Kennedy soon flees, leaving Booth relatively unhurt whilst still restrained. Meanwhile, Brennan's estranged father pays her a visit. Brennan later appeals to her father to find Booth, having not heard from him. When they get to Baltimore, they find Kennedy's hotel room and the bounty hunter inside. Brennan gets violent with her when she finds Booth's tooth in the hallway, suspecting the bounty hunter's involvement in her partner's abduction.

A large group of SSS members with the GDM members decide to pass on, satisfied with their time together, and the main cast of SSS members fight on against increasing numbers of shadows. Meanwhile, Yuri heads for the Guild and encounters more shadows. Shiina tells Otonashi to separate, and both Hinata and Naoi follow. While dreaming of an ordinary classroom life, Yuri almost becomes an NPC just as the group with Otonashi and Kanade save her. They fight more shadows, and Yuri enters a hidden room, where the stolen computers are all running the Angel Player software. Also, Yuri finds an unknown boy there, and she questions him about various aspects of the afterlife. In the end, Yuri resists the temptation of becoming God and destroys all the computers. Afterwards, she dreams about her forgiving siblings, and in the infirmary, Otonashi and the four others look over her as she wakes up.",

Per Kanade's idea, they hold a graduation ceremony, complete with an anthem, diplomas, and a speech. At end of the ceremony, Naoi takes his leave; Yuri makes her peace with Kanade before she leaves; and Hinata follows shortly. Alone together, Otonashi suggests to remain in the afterlife with Kanade, intending to help others who might enter the afterlife. At the same time, he confesses his love to her, but she reveals herself as the recipient of his transplanted heart. After giving Otonashi her gratitude, she finally disappears, leaving him in frantic tears. Finally, in an epilogue, a girl resembling Kanade is humming Iwasawa's \"My Song\" in the world of the living, and a boy resembling Otonashi passes by and recognizes the melody.

Alternatively, in the BD/DVD-exclusive short \"Another Epilogue\", Otonashi remains in the afterlife and becomes the new student council president, helping out other students to pass on.",
