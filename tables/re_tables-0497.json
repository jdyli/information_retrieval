After all, the last time her quirky restaurateur parents told her to come straight home she ended up as a contestant on a kiddy game show! But nothing she could ever have imagined could have prepared her for their \"great news\"... Miharu is getting married! How's a spirited and independent teenager who has never even kissed a boy supposed to deal with suddenly having a fianc\u00e9 she's never even met?

        "When the Gedoushu are revived and begin to attack the mortal realm, Takeru Shiba of the Shiba House takes arms to fight them as Shinken Red. After defeating a company of Nanashi, Takeru becomes annoyed when his retainer, Hikoma Kusakabe, affectionately called \"Jii\", implores him to find his four vassals to fight alongside him, instead of fighting on his own. Meanwhile, on the Sanzu River, Doukoku finally awakens, and upon learning that the Shinkengers still exist, becomes enraged and sends the Akayashi Kagekamuro to attack the humans with an army of Nanashi. Against Takeru's wishes, Jii summons the vassals: kabuki actor Ryunosuke Ikenami, kindergarten teacher Mako Shiraishi, carefree Chiaki Tani, and pure-hearted Kotoha Hanaori. Upon meeting the four, Takeru gives each one a chance to back out of his service, and when all four decline, he gives each one a Shodo Phone. Takeru, Ryunosuke, Chiaki, Mako, and Kotoha then take on Kagekamuro and his numerous Nanashi. Shinken Red slays Kagekamuro, but in spite of that, he tells his vassals to remain on their guard. Sure enough, the Ayakashi is reborn as a giant, so the Shinkengers enlarge their Origami to confront and destroy him. After the battle, Jii arrives to bring everyone to the Shiba House.",

While he attempts this, the vassals attack the Ayakashi Yanasudare whose attacks have no effect on his flexible body and are no match for his marksmanship. Once Shinken Red arrives, the Shinkengers are no match for Yanasudare who falls back when he begins to dry up. While at the Shiba House, Jii instills hope in the vassals as Takeru reveals the Kabuto Disk to them and it may be the key to defeat the Ayakashi once he masters doubling his Modikara. Takeru keeps training into the night, nearly destroying himself with Jii watching with worry. The next day, a rehydrated Yanasudare resumes his attack with the vassals arriving to fight him as Takeru arrives to challenge him.

Though the Shinkengers worry for Takeru and Ryunosuke, a mysterious figure arrives to reveal that Takeru is the winner in the fight. As Takeru defeats Ryunosuke and breaks the Ayakashi's spell, an angered Hitomidama summons the Tora Origami to take out the Shinkengers. While Shinken Red uses the Sisi Origami to reclaim the Tora Origami, the vassals kill Hitomidama. When Hitomidama revives as a giant, the Tora Origami overwhelms its former master as Shinkenoh is formed, combining with it to become Tora-Shinkenoh to finish the Ayakashi off. As the others help a wounded Ryunosuke who is distraught about nearly destroying Takeru, they are shocked when Takeru apologizes to him, explaining that the technique he used to break Hitomidama's spell could have killed Ryuunosuke. Takeru tells his vassal to never mention it again as the mysterious man, Juzo in human form, watches them leave."

        "While fighting the Nanashi, the Shinkengers are astonished to find high school students interfering with the battle. Afterwards, Takeru notices that all the students attend the private Takashiro Academy, so he sends Ryunosuke and Kotoha, posing as a teacher and student respectively, and DaiGoyou to the school to investigate possible Gedoushu activity. The next day, Ryunosuke, drawing from previous experience, suspects that a couple of teachers are Gedoushu in disguise, but is proven wrong when he finds them in a trance just like the students from before. Ryunosuke soon suspects that Kotoha's new friend, Eri Takahashi, is the Gedoushu until she, too, becomes entranced. As Kotoha feels guilty about not being able to keep Eri safe, she suddenly notices that Eri has a thin white band around her wrist that was not previously there. Kotoha and Ryunosuke soon discover that all the affected students and teachers have the white bands on their wrists. DaiGoyou's light shows that all the bands are connected to a network of strings. When Ryunosuke tries to cut the strings, the Ayakashi Kugutsukai reveals himself. Shinken Blue and Shinken Yellow engage him as their teammates arrive to assist. Kugutsukai, however, summons the entranced students and teachers to serve in holding the Shinkengers off. Shinken Yellow uses her Modikara to help Super Shinken Blue take out Kugutsukai and free everyone from the trance. Shinken DaiGoyou and Ika-Daikaioh double team Kugutsukai before DaiGoyou destroys him. With the school saved, Ryunosuke and Kotoha say goodbye to everyone in Takashiro Academy.",

Mamoru asks Mako to quit the Shinkengers and move to Hawaii with him. Before Mako can answer, the Shinkengers must head to Takekuni to confront the Nanashi, who are attacking an elementary school and kidnapping children. During the melee, Shinken Pink manages to plant a gap sensor on a little boy before the Nanashi spirit him away. The Shinkengers learn more about Mako's childhood before Mamoru again tries to convince Mako to quit the team and move to Hawaii. The Shinkengers soon learn that Akumaro is holding the children in Yamai, where he intends to use them to help create dry riverbeds to receive the Sanzu River in the mortal realm. One of the children escapes, chased by a group of Nanashi. Mako rescues the boy, but is injured in the process. Shinken Red, Shinken Blue, and Shinken Green arrive to fight the Gedoushu while Shinken Gold and Shinken Yellow help the children to safety. Akumaro easily beats the five Shinkengers by himself. Mako wants to join the battle, but Mamoru is reluctant to let her. When Mako berates him for not being a good parent, Mamoru tells her exactly why he and Kyoko left Japan years ago, leaving Mako in the care of her grandmother. Mako firmly tells her father that she won't quit the Shinkengers and bears no grudge against her parents before she transforms and slays the Nanashi present and, after becoming Super Shinken Pink, defeats Akumaro.

        "As Genta points out the possible yet risky combination of their Origami with the Ushi Origami, Ryunosuke visits his old kabuki theater, reminiscing about his life before becoming a Shinkenger. On his way back to the Shiba House, he comes across the Ayakashi Futagawara terrorizing people and eating everything in sight. When he tries to transform, his Shodo Phone is eaten, leaving him to watch his comrades fight Futagawara and get overpowered before the Ayakashi takes his leave. Without his Shodo Phone, Ryunosuke goes back to the kabuki theater to watch his friend Shintaro practice for an upcoming performance that both were supposed to perform together until Ryunosuke became a Shinkenger. The next day, Futagawara resumes his feeding frenzy as the Shinkengers arrive to face him and attempt to regain Ryunosuke's Shodo Phone, However, Juzo and Dayu arrive to prevent the Shinkengers from defeating Futagawara, allowing the Ayakashi to eat even more. Elsewhere, Ryunosuke (in disguise) approaches Shintaro to inspire him to perfect the dance, and to make amends for what he feels is leaving his best friend to fight the Gedoushu. Having succeeded, Ryunosuke joins the others as Juzo and Dayu destroy Futagawara themselves to unleash his full power, with Shinken Red barely retrieving Ryunosuke's Shodo Phone before the Ayakashi grows to immense proportions and gains a shield to defend and attack with. The Shinkengers form Daikai-Shinkenoh, but they cannot break through Futagawara's shield. Shinken Blue uses this opportunity to convince Super Shinken Red to take out the All Samurai Gattai Disk and combine all of the Origami. As the Secret Disk is placed into the Inromaru, Shinken Blue activates its Modikara, allowing all of the Origami to combine into Samuraihaoh. With their newfound power, the Shinkengers break through Futagawara's wall-like shield and destroy him. After the battle, Ryunosuke watches Shintaro prepare for the kabuki performance and he intents to keep a vow to his friend that he will return to kabuki once the Gedoushu are finally defeated.",

Kotoha finds the curry delicious, and it begins to attract attention and, more importantly, customers to Gold Zushi. When the Ayakashi Sogizarai attacks, Genta must leave the cart to help the Shinkengers battle him. Sogizarai's spinning attacks completely overwhelm the Shinkengers, but he dries out and is forced to retreat. After the battle, Takeru and the vassals visit Genta when a businessman offers to move him from the sushi cart to an actual restaurant. Genta thinks about the proposal, which causes Kotoha to feel guilty. The next day, Kotoha apologizes to Genta for mentioning curry in the first place, and the two talk about Genta's dream to have his own sushi restaurant. The businessman returns with the plans for the restaurant, which would sell only curry. Genta firmly rejects the offer just as Sogizarai returns to resume his assault on the city. The Shinkengers engage him, but are still unsure of how to deal with his spinning attacks until Shinken Yellow uses the Inromaru to become Super Shinken Yellow, countering Sogizarai's attacks with her own spinning attack.

        "Takeru tells his vassals that Hikoma will be leaving them for his yearly day off to visit the resting place of his wife and visit his daughter and granddaughter. But because the fight with the Gedoushu has gotten worse, Hikoma may not take his day off. Deciding to make sure Hikoma will have a good day, the Shinkengers replace the real Gap Sensor with a fake so Hikoma can enjoy himself. The next day, the Ayakashi Ikusazure appears with his gun squad for target practice as the Shinkengers arrive to fight them. Managing to drive the Gedoushu back, after getting Hikoma to leave, the Shinkengers carry out Hikoma's daily responsibilities until Ikusazure resumes his target practice. The Shinkengers use their speed to get close enough the Nanashi to take them out until Shinken Gold gets gunned down by the Nanashi reinforcements who overwhelm the rest of the team. At the last second, Hikoma arrives with the Mougyu Bazooka which Super Shinken Red uses to turn the tables, revealing that he knew of their attempt to give him a worry-free day off. Upgrading it to the Super Mougyu Bazooka, Super Shinken Red destroys Ikusazure. When the Ayakashi revives, Mougyudaioh and Shinken DaiGoyou fight him and his cannon wielding \u014cnanashi.

        "After learning of possible Gedoushu activity on an island, the Shinkengers travel to investigate. After splitting up into three groups, Takeru and Mako and Genta and Chiaki are ambushed by villagers driven insane. Ryunosuke and Kotoha encounter a young boy who tells them of an ash causing an illness amongst the villagers, making them paranoid and blood-thirsty. When the two go to warn the others, they are ambushed by Dayu and knocked out. Elsewhere, Akumaro ambushes Genta and Chiaki, placing them under the influence of the ash that he has created, and Juzo attacks Shinken Red and Pink, noting that Takeru has become weaker upon valuing his life over that of fighting. This distracts him and allows Juzo to injure him until Mako takes him out of the battle and into safety. Still angered, he runs off to fight Juzo, again, with Mako in tow. They arrive at a mountain guarded by Juzo and Dayu that is producing the ash infecting the village. While Mako fights Dayu as Shinken Pink, Takeru transforms into Super Shinken Red to fight Juzo and free the island from the ash's influence. After destroying the source of the ash and breaking Akumaro's hold on the island, Akumaro takes Juzo and Dayu away, leaving a Kirigami and a pair of \u014cnosakamata to keep the Shinkengers at bay. The group forms Daikai-Shinkenoh to fight the monsters and to destroy the \u014cnosakamata, eventually needing to use Samuraihaoh to destroy the Kirigami. Having freed the island, the Shinkengers head back home, with Juzo's words still burning in Takeru's mind as Mako keeps a worried eye on her lord.",

Akumaro is shocked as Juzo reveals that he knew the sword's true nature the entire time, and he thanks Akumaro for repairing it. Realizing his plans are ruined now that Juzo was now a true Gedoushu, Akumaro takes his rage on the Shinkengers as they slay him with the Rekka Daizantou and the Mougyu Bazooka. Akumaro enlarges and battles Mougyudaioh and DaiGoyou while Shinkenoh and Daikaioh destroy Kirigami Akumaro summoned. The Shinkengers then form Samuraihaoh to finish of Akumaro, only for the Modikara Great Shot Circle to have no effect against him. On Shinken Gold's suggestion, Super Shinken Red summons the Kyoryu Origami, with Samuraihaoh using the Kyoryuto to destroy Akumaro with the Twelve Origami Great Samurai Slash. After, the battle Genta now knows the true nature of the Gedoushu. When they all return to the Shiba House to find Jii and the Kuroko in the middle of decorating for Christmas, they help with the finishing touches."

        "The epic duel between Shinken Red and Juzo reaches its climax. Dayu senses the conflict, as well as a premonition that Doukoku may soon reawaken. The vassals leave to find Takeru, but Ryunosuke stays behind, plagued with self-doubt. The kuroko Sakutaro Komatsu reveals himself to Ryunosuke and reminds him that only he can truly decide his own fate. By nightfall, a badly injured Shinken Red manages to deliver what seems to be a mortal blow to Juzo, but the Gedoushu revives, stating his ideology to Takeru. The other Shinkengers, sans Ryunosuke, arrive and tell Takeru that he has more to live for than he thinks. Juzo prepares to fight, but is shocked to discover that Uramasa has pinned his foot to the ground and will not budge. Ryunosuke arrives and helps his teammates take Takeru to safety as Juzo dies, lamenting that he's been denied his only pleasure. Uramasa remains planted upright in the ground as Juzo's body dissipates. Back onboard the Rokumon Junk, after learning of Juzo's death, Dayu realizes that her repaired shamisen may complete Doukoku's reawakening. The next day, as Uramasa fades away, Takeru tells his former vassals to leave him. Chiaki strikes him, much to the others' shock, and Ryunosuke reminds Takeru that he and the others had sworn their loyalty to him, not Kaoru. Mako then reminds Takeru that despite him not being the 18th Head of the Shiba Clan, everything Takeru built up as himself properly exists. Takeru, looking back at his memories with his vassals, explained that he feels the same, then starts to shed a tear. Suddenly, they receive a call that a group of \u014cnanashi have appeared, and Kaoru, with Genta at her side, has already engaged them in Daikai-Shinkenoh. While the other vassals fight the Nanashi Company, and while an untransformed Takeru helps the kuroko bring civilians to safety, Shinken Pink confronts Dayu. Shinken Pink engages Dayu, and apparently strikes her down, but Dayu reveals that her shamisen had taken the killing blow and had been destroyed. Shinza's anguished soul, now finally free from its confinement within Dayu's shamisen, allows Doukoku to arise and invade the mortal realm.",

They encounter Tanba, who gives them another Shiba House Disk, which Kaoru risked her well being to create, along with his own Twin Disk. Shinken Red uses the Twin Disk to summon a second Rekka Daizantou, and the Shinkengers manage to overpower Doukoku as Shinken Blue uses the Shiba House Disk to deliver the deathblow. Assuming his second life, an enlarged Doukoku overpowers the Shinkengers in Samuraihaoh. Under Takeru's guidance, Samuraihaoh charges Doukoku head-on, as he breaks off the Origami combinations until only Shinkenoh remains. The Shinkengers use all their Modikara in one final attack, successfully destroying Doukoku for good. With Doukoku's demise, the Sanzu River withdraws from the mortal realm as Shitari goes down with the Rokumon Junk. Later, after Kaoru leaves him with the task of continuing the Shiba House's fight against the Gedoushu, Takeru bids farewell to his friends: Genta heads to Paris to make a name for himself in the cooking world; Kotoha returns home to Kyoto to take care of her sister; Chiaki leaves for college; Mako goes to live with her parents in Hawaii; and Ryunosuke resumes his kabuki career. Until the Gedoushu resurface, Takeru will remain on watch for them while Jii attempts to give his lord a hobby outside of being a samurai."

After Najimi gets the cats off of them, Miku runs off again and Melon gives chase, only to be assaulted by Kakeru, who was trying to escape from Otoya.

        "Different types of equipment designs support different levels of skill and experience to provide optimal solutions - for example the BCD. A majority of diving accidents occur at the novice diving level, and many of these accidents occur at the surface. For these novice divers the jacket style type of BCD provides better heads-up surface flotation necessary to mitigate such risks, instead of the wing type BCD recommended by DIR."

The computation or referencing of dive tables by infrequent of less experienced divers is much more subject to human error, particularly as these divers often have to deal with more complicated repetitive diving computations or tables. These sorts of errors are not made by dive computers, which become particularly effective in mitigating diver risks in these circumstances. Dive computers can greatly reduce task loading and allow less experienced divers to focus on other dive requirements, e.g. navigation, while still providing very effective monitoring of dive safety parameters. To quote John Batin \"No serious diver should be equipped without a dive computer, and there are many to choose from. Diving computers probably represent the single most important advance in diving equipment since the invention of the aqualung.\""

        "The opening animation changes with this episode, though the opening theme song remains the same. Chacha, Riiya, and Shiine explain to Seravy and Dorothy what happened with the rock giant and Piisuke. Meanwhile, the Daima\u014d sends Access to defeat Chacha at any cost, and send Haideyansu and Yordas to keep an eye on Access ad report on his actions. Seravy tells Chacha they need to try out her strength with the Phoenix Sword (Wing Kris). She summons the phoenix using the words \"Saint Fairy Navigation\" while firing a Beauty Selene Arrow. She attacks the monster summoned by Seravy only to find out it's a balloon which easily dodges her first attack. The Magical Princess tries again, but the Wing Kris Burning Flash attack gets out of control, chasing Riiya and Shiine and burning Dorothy. Seravy tells Chacha she'll need to practice more in order to master the sword. They go to the school in order to have their teachers help train them. After Mr. Rascal offers to help train them, they determine he knows nothing about swords and go to visit Orin where her grandfather offers to teach Chacha what she needs to know. While they trained hard, they didn't learn too much in the way of actual sword fighting. After leaving Orin's home, while singing about defeating the Daima\u014d, they run into Access. He easily defeats Riiya and Shiine and goes after Chacha next. After Chacha and her friends try multiple things to distract Access, Chacha transforms and summons the Phoenix Sword, but Access knocks it out of her hands with one strike.

Meanwhile, the Daima\u014d sends Access to defeat Chacha at any cost, and send Haideyansu and Yordas to keep an eye on Access ad report on his actions. Seravy tells Chacha they need to try out her strength with the Phoenix Sword (Wing Kris). She summons the phoenix using the words \"Saint Fairy Navigation\" while firing a Beauty Selene Arrow. She attacks the monster summoned by Seravy only to find out it's a balloon which easily dodges her first attack. The Magical Princess tries again, but the Wing Kris Burning Flash attack gets out of control, chasing Riiya and Shiine and burning Dorothy. Seravy tells Chacha she'll need to practice more in order to master the sword. They go to the school in order to have their teachers help train them. After Mr. Rascal offers to help train them, they determine he knows nothing about swords and go to visit Orin where her grandfather offers to teach Chacha what she needs to know.

Meanwhile, Access tells the Daima\u014d that he needs some time in order to defeat Chacha. Seravy cheats again in order to win the card game again, and Shiine, still deep in thought and not paying attention to the game, decides to go home. Dorothy is taking a bubble bath and contemplating the possibility of Shiine fighting his father, Access, and decides she needs to ask Seravy about it.

Dorothy asks Shiine to clean up the place and have dinner ready when she gets back.

Barikimassu R\u016b then tells them who he really is: a denizen of the Demon World and the best blacksmith there. He attacks M\u016bra M\u0101sa, Chacha, and her friends, and M\u016bra M\u0101sa runs away. He doesn't get far, though, before meeting Seravy, who tells him he needs to stop running. Meanwhile, Chacha has transformed and Barikimassu R\u016b is taking everything she can throw at him. The Bird Shield is strong enough to withstand even her most powerful attacks. Seravy convinces M\u016bra M\u0101sa to help the princess, and he returns and tells her the shield isn't the real Bird Shield. Seravay also tells Riiya and Shiine to believe in Chacha and project their confidence into her. She is then able to defeat Barikimassu R\u016b. M\u016bra M\u0101sa tells them he needs the Angel Iron Sand in order to make the real Bird Shield."

Meanwhile, Chacha and her friends come upon a narrow but very deep valley, and only way across (short of climbing down into the valley) is abridge which has been destroyed. They try several ways to cross it, but none of them work. Haideyansu and Yordas disguise themselves and \"sell\" a powered balloon to Chacha and friends for free. Partway across the valley, however, the balloon explodes and the fall into the valley, only to get caught on a very long log being held out by Riiya's grandfather. Suddenly, the ground starts shaking and a large man in armor, Garrok, who attacks Riiya's grandfather and almost takes him into the deep valley. He explains that Garrok was the designer and builder of the bridge, and when the Daima\u014d took over, Riiya's grandfather destroyed the bridge to allow Seravy to escape. The Daima\u014d used Garrok's sadness and turned him to the side of evil. Garrok, who had been collapsed on a ledge far below, is commanded by the Daima\u014d to destroy Chacha, so he jumps back to the top and slices off the remainder of the bridge where Chacha and her friends are standing, causing it to fall into the deep valley below. Riiya's grandfather jumps in after them, catches up to them, and protects them as they continue falling. The bottom of the valley is full of molten lava, though, and Chacha gets separated from the others which allows Garrok to attack her. Before she can fall into the lava, though, she transforms and summons the Phoenix Sword. Garrok causes darkness to fall all around her so she can't see where he is.

Extended dive duration and surveys of previously unexplored parts of the cave system exposed divers to unprecedented exposures. Diving of this type is subject to increased level of risk and increased risks require more stringent mitigation.",
        "Equipment must be selected such that it is suitable for more advanced diving practise. Such equipment should be consistently reliable and offer adequate performance for the more extreme environments it may be used in. It is proposed that this equipment will also be suitable for less advanced activities. Redundancy in equipment configuration is necessary in main life-support systems. Part of this redundancy has to be provided by the diver, and part can be provided by the combined team. Equipment must be minimised to only that which is essential to minimise failure modes and accomplish the tasks of the dive. The large amount of equipment necessary for the extreme penetrations made it essential to rigorously optimise every aspect of equipment configuration and procedure to keep the task loading and equipment burden to a level that made the dives physically practicable at a personally acceptable level of risk."

        "In certain non-cave diving practises the snorkel proves a very useful item, e.g. due to the long swims involved in California shore diving, divers use snorkels to breathe from until a good start point on a dive spot is located, to maximise air supply for a safer overall dive. A snorkel is useful as an in-water pocket mask, a diving accident victim can be transported and have rescue breathing done as quickly as they might be just transported. In rougher open water surface conditions a snorkel proves a useful safety device in scenarios that require long surface waits or surface swims. BSAC rate the snorkel as \"essential safety kit.\""
