The Baldwins believe that a man named John Pierce, who is serving a prison sentence for molesting children, is the guilty culprit. At the time of the disappearance, Pierce was a suspect, but the police did not have enough evidence to charge him with the kidnapping. The Baldwins believe their son was murdered, and they just want to know the location of the body. They persuade Bobby to bring a civil lawsuit against John Pierce for the \"wrongful death\" of their son. They believe that under the threat of a lawsuit, which could jeopardize his parole, Pierce will tell them the location of their son's body. Bobby moves forward with the case, though on the witness stand, Pierce insists that he did not kidnap the boy. At the end of the episode, Bobby is approached by a young man who believes that he is the boy who was kidnapped years ago. Meanwhile, Jimmy still owes money to his bookie, Sid. After being seriously threatened, Jimmy \"borrows\" money from a client's trust fund. He uses the money to bet on horses, and he wins enough to pay back the bookie. Jimmy returns the client's money, but not before Eugene and Bobby discover his reckless action.",

She claims that John Pierce \"left\" the boy with her, claiming that the child was his own son. Allison Tucker agrees to testify as part of the trial against John Pierce, and can provide crucial testimony to keep him behind bars. But she is worried that she could also be charged as an accessory to the crime, so she first cuts an immunity deal with the district attorney's office. After she testifies, however, unsettling news is uncovered. According to Allison Tucker's sister, Allison had a few miscarriages, and once threatened to \"go to a hospital and steal a baby.\" Bobby believes that Allison Tucker is the real kidnapper, and that she brilliantly framed John Pierce. He shares this news with the Baldwins, who ask that Bobby not tell the district attorney the truth. They are desperate to restore their relationship with their estranged son, and are afraid of attacking the woman who raised him. In the end, John Pierce accepts a plea bargain for seven more years in prison, as he knows the case against him is overwhelming.",

He agrees. After the shooter has been killed by police, Helen reneges on the deal, claiming Jackie hasn't fulfilled the terms of the agreement. Jackie's lawyer protests and drags Helen into court. However, because Jackie threatened to put a 'hit' on Helen from within prison after she reneged on the deal, the judge adds 75 years to each of Jackie's counts, meaning he will be up for parole in 150 years. Meanwhile, Rebecca and Jimmy defend a man on charges that he strangled his wife. Rebecca is adamant about the man's innocence, arguing that the only reason he's being prosecuted is because he was stunned by his wife's death and gave the investigating officer erroneous information.
