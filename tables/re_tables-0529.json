Alchiba returned to Guadalcanal on 18 September. After unloading cargo to support marines struggling for that island, she sailed back to New Caledonia for more supplies and returned to Guadalcanal on 1 November. She was anchored off Lunga Point at 0616 on 28 November, when two torpedoes from the Japanese submarine 1-16 exploded on the vessel s port side. At that time, her hold was loaded with drums of gasoline and ammunition, and the resulting explosion shot flames feet (m) in the air. The commanding officer ordered the ship to get underway to run her up on the beach. This action undoubtedly saved the ship. Hungry flames raged in the ship for over five days before weary fire fighting parties finally brought them under control. Salvage operations began soon thereafter. Most of her cargo was saved, and temporary repairs were in progress when Alchiba was torpedoed again on 7 December. An enemy submarine's conning tower had been spotted shortly before two torpedoes were fired. One passed close under the cargo ship's stern, but the other struck her port side near the engine room. The blast killed three men, wounded six others, and caused considerable structural damage. Once the fires and flooding were controlled, salvage operations resumed and enabled the ship to get underway for Tulagi on 27 December 1942.\""

        "\"For extraordinary heroism in action as a Picket Ship on Radar Picket Station during a coordinated attack by approximately twenty-five Japanese aircraft near Okinawa on May 3, 1945. Shooting down two Kamikazes which approached in determined suicide dives, the U.S.S. Aaron Ward was struck by a bomb from a third suicide plane as she fought to destroy this attacker before it crashed into her superstructure and sprayed the entire area with flaming gasoline. Instantly flooded in her after engineroom and fireroom, she battled against flames and exploding ammunition on deck and, maneuvering in a tight circle because of damage to her steering gear, countered another coordinated suicide attack and destroyed three Kamikazes in rapid succession. Still smoking heavily and maneuvering radically, she lost all power when her forward fireroom flooded under a seventh suicide plane which dropped a bomb close aboard and dived in flames into the main deck. Unable to recover from this blow before an eighth bomber crashed into her superstructure bulkhead only a few seconds later, she attempted to shoot down a ninth Kamikaze diving toward her at high speed and, despite the destruction of nearly all her gun mounts aft when this plane struck her, took under fire the tenth bomb-laden plane, which penetrated the dense smoke to crash on board with a devastating explosion. With fires raging uncontrolled, ammunition exploding and all engine spaces except the forward engineroom flooded as she settled in the water and listed to port, she began a nightlong battle to remain afloat and, with the assistance of a towing vessel, finally reached port the following morning. By her superb fighting spirit and the courage and determination of her entire company, the Aaron Ward upheld the finest traditions of the United States Naval Service.\""

        "For outstanding performance of duty in armed conflict with the enemy in the Mediterranean Theater of Operations on 12 May 1944. Participating in the operations which preceded and supported the Allied breakthrough at Cassino, Italy, the 320th Bombardment Group, displaying extraordinary accuracy in effectively bombarding rail and highway bridges, troop concentrations, airfields nd shipping, repeatedly dropped all its bombs within 200 yards of pinpoint targets. On 12 May 1944, in direct support of the Fifth Army's advance along the coastal highway toward Rome, the 320th Bombardment Group achieved spectacular results in an attack on heavily defended enemy troop concentrations,including the famed 15th Panzer Grenadier Division, bivouaced near Fondi. At 1330 hours, thirty six B-26 Marauder aircraft of the 320th Bombardment Group took off from their Sardinian Base and made landfall southeast of Sperlonga, Italy. Displaying superior flying skills and extraordinary heroism,the group pilots steadfastly held their flights intact through heavy and accurate anit-aircraft fire which tracked them from landfall to the target and back to the coast. So deadly was the hostile fire that,notwithstanding, the most skillfull employment of vigorous evasive action,seventeen of their bombers were damaged and several crew members wounded.Rsolutely continuing on a long, deliberate bomb run despite the intense barage,determined pilots,expertly holding their unescorted Marauders in a superbly coordinated formation, enabled the bombers to release 3,978 fragmentation bombs with unerring precision. The concentrated pattern which blanketed the target area inflicted irreplaceable casualties and destruction upon the already hard pressed enemy, smashing this key concentration of reserves and rendering incalculable aid to the Allied ground forces in their drive northward, The outstanding results achieved which set it above and apart from other units participating in the same engagement are typical of the continuously superior precision bpmbing of the 320th Bombardment Group, and were possibly only through remarkable leadership, unstinted effort and superlative performance of duty by every member of the organization. Through their unsurpassed courage,skill in combat and steadfast devotion of duty, the personnel of the 320th Bombardment Group have reflected great credit upon themselves and the Military Service of the United States.

        "The 320th Bombardment Group. For outstanding performance of duty in action against the enemy in the European Theater of Operations on March 15, 1945. In direct coordination with the Allied Offensive against the enemy ground forces in the Saar-Palatinate, the Seventh Army was ordered to attack directly through the strongly fortified Seigfried Line along a front east of Zweibrucken, Germany; the objective of this Marauder Group was to effectively blanket hostile pillboxes, and tank obstructions with heavy demolition bombs to sufficiently weaken that much vaunted line, enabling the ground forces to break through the enemy positions. Despite accurate anti-aircraft fire from the Seigfried defenses, the 320th Bombardment Group released a devastatingly accurate concentration of bombs to create inestimable damage to installations and personnel. The conspicuous part played by this group set it above and apart from other units participating in the same engagement and insured the success of these operations. Beginning at 0630 hours, on March 15, 1945, five waves of nineteen B-26 aircraft of the 320th Bombardment Group took off from this French base. Despite persistent and accurate ground fire, the Marauders resolutely persevered on unwavering axes of attack to execute long deliberate and flawless bomb runs releasing 1340 high explosives in perfect patterns within the assigned coordinates despite heavy ground haze, inflicting irreplaceable casualties upon the enemy personnel. After photographs revealed pillboxes, communication trenches, weapons pits and roads devastated within the target area with such effect that the Seventh Army made its initial breakthrough of the Seigfried Line with virtually no opposition over the areas attacked by the 320th Bombardment Group. This perfectly executed endeavor of air-ground coordination was carried through to its highly successful conclusion by a complete coverage of heavy, visibly limiting, ground haze. This was accomplished by the remarkable leadership of perfectly teamed pilot-bombardier combinations thoroughly trained in the revolutionary technique on non-visual Shoran bombing and the constantly proficient contributions of all personnel in this Marauder Group. This Operation is typical of the superior bombing of the 320th Bombardment Group, has reflected the greatest credit upon the Group and the Armed Service of the United States. By Command of Major General Webster: C. E. Crumrine, Colonel, AC Chief of Staff."

        "The 387th Bombardment Group is cited for extraordinary heroism in armed conflict with the enemy on 23 December 1944, when the group was dispatched to attack a vital and strongly defended railway bridge at Mayen, Germany. While en route to the target the second box of B-26 airplanes, which was without fighter escort and was separated by several miles from the first box, was viciously attacked by from 15 to 25 Messerschmitt aircraft. Despite the determined defensive fire which took a large toll of the hostile fighters, the enemy pressed his attacks with such fury that the low flight was overpowered and four B-26 aircraft were forced down in flames. Although in the ensuing encounters every airplane in the remaining two flights sustained damage from the enemy attacks, the gallant airmen succeeded in driving four of the enemy airplanes to certain destruction and forcing four more to break away in flames. Meanwhile the first box pressed on to the target despite intermittent flank and the imminence of fighter attack. Although a pathfinder failure occurred 1 minute before bomb-release time, the bombardiers synchronized on the target with such accuracy that extensive damage was inflicted on the bridge. Notwithstanding the heavy losses incurred during the enemy attacks the second box returned for an additional run on the target, and as a result of their determined efforts the central portion of the bridge span was completely destroyed. Despite the severe damage inflicted on the group's aircraft during the morning mission, the officers and men of the 387th Bombardment Group displayed great determination in embarking on another mission only 2 hours after the bombers had returned to base. A withering hail of antiaircraft fire was encountered over the target area at Prum, Germany, which damaged 21 of the 26 airplanes dispatched. In the face of this sustained barrage of flak the courageous airmen released their bombs with a high degree of accuracy upon the communications installations. In carrying out this dual blow against the enemy's communication and transportation facilities on this date, the officers and men of the 387th Bombardment Group displayed aerial skill, resolution, and devotion to duty in keeping with the finest traditions of the Army Air Forces. General Orders 140, Headquarters Ninth Air Force, 23 July 1945, as approved by the Commanding General, United States Forces, European Theater (Main).

Following the Rhine River crossings made on a large scale by allied Armies, the 42nd United States Infantry Divisions arrived at the out skirts of the fortress city of Schweinfurt, Germany, an important communications center. With its advance towards Nuremberg and Munich impeded by numerous strong points in this city, which constituted one of the principle German held defense bastions, it was necessary to neutralize Schweinfurt by air bombardment. The magnificent air cooperation provided the 42nd Division by the 42nd bombardment Wing on this noteworthy occasion is an eloquent tribute to the effectiveness of air ground coordination and teamwork. The preeminent part played by the 17th Bombardment Group set it above and apart from other units participating in the same engagement and insured the effectiveness of these operations as a whole. After taking off from their base at Dijon, France, at 09.15 hours on 10 April 1945, sixty-eight B-26 aircraft from the Group commenced their bombing run near the objective amid a barrage of heavy and accurate anti-aircraft fire which damaged fifteen of the attacking Marauders. The twelve flights of bombers resolutely persevered on their course over the target in perfect formation and accomplished the bombing with incredible precision. Photo reconnaissance revealed that the 133 tons of bombs released on the objective by the 17th Bombardment Group achieved unparalleled destruction. Such extensive damage was inflicted upon the city by blast and fire that the military effectiveness of the enemy troops defending the city was paralyzed. The success of the mission, so typical of the superior bombing of the 17th Bombardment Group, was so catastrophic for the enemy that the 42nd Division was able to seize Schweinfurt with virtually no opposition, thereby accelerating the advance of the Seventh Army towards Nuremberg and Munich, thus bringing to a more rapid conclusion the ultimate victory of the Allies. The thoroughness of the mission planning and the precision of the execution attests to the efficiency, \u00e9lan, and determination of the combat crews. The superior results achieved are attributable to the extensive cooperation and devotion to duty displayed by the ground crews and the administration staffs who made possible such an exceptional achievement. The enormous damage inflicted upon the enemy installations by the 17th Bombardment Group in the Mediterranean and European Theater of Operations, during a period of twenty-nine consecutive months of air warfare was accomplished by a consistently high bombing accuracy which is believed to be without precedent. Through its unique and highly successful performance against the enemy in six hundred and six bombing missions, the 17th Bombardment Group has won for itself an enviable position in the Army Air Forces which reflected the greatest credit upon the Group conforming to the most illustrious traditions of the United States military service. By Command of Major General Webster. C. E. Crumrine Colonel, AC Chief of Staff"

        "The 450th Bombardment Group (H) is cited for outstanding performance of duty in armed conflict with the enemy. On 24 February 1944, the 450th Bombardment Group (H) was notified to prepare a maximum number of aircraft for a mission against the Prufening Aircraft Factory in Regensburg, Germany. The initial purpose of this attack was to destroy the important plant, capable of producing two hundred and fifty ME 109's monthly. A successful completion of the mission would cost the enemy 8 to 9 months of production and would materially diminish Nazi interception of allied strategic bombing on the continent. Throughout the evening prior to the attack the ground crews worked untiringly in a muddy field, determined to have their aircraft in perfect mechanical condition for this vital operation. On 25 February 1944, twenty nine B-24 type aircraft heavily loaded with maximum tonnage took off for their important destination in the lead of an entire wing formation. Hazardous weather was encountered shortly after the take off, and over 15 enemy fighters intercepted them while they were still 300 miles from the target. The gallant crews fought off the enemy onslaught, overcame the hazards of weather, and unwaveringly held to their course as a second wave of twenty ME 109's attacked them. The approach to the target and the target proper were heavily defended by flak batteries that threw up an intense barrage through which the formation flew undaunted to a precise bombing run, delivering a telling blow to the important factory and surrounding installations. This outstanding contributed immeasurably to the effective crippling of enemy production at a significant time. The palls of smoke issuing from the debris left in the wake of the bombers obscured observation, but subsequent reconnaissance revealed a complete destruction of the target. Throughout the serial battle the courageous crews fought two more enemy onslaughts en route and accounted for one enemy aircraft destroyed. Our own losses were held down to 4 lost, in a mission wrought with hazardous weather, intense ground defences, and a total of over 60 enemy fighters. By the determination, outstanding professional skill, and heroic courage of the combat crews, together with the devotion to duty of the ground personnel, the 450th Bombardment Group (H) has rendered an invaluable contribution to the allied war effort, thereby reflecting great credit on themselves and the armed forces of the United States."

On 4 April 1944, the 450th Bombardment Group was notified to prepare a maximum number of aircraft for a mission against the Ploesti Marshalling Yards in Rumania. The initial purpose of this mission was disrupt the enemy's oil supply so vital to their operations on the Eastern front and to their interception of Allied strategic bombing. Prior to this operation, the ground crews worked zealously with grim determination to have their aircraft at the peak of mechanical performance to insure the success of the mission. On 5 April 1944, forty (40) B-24 type aircraft, heavily loaded with maximum tonnage, were airborne, and, after assuming the lead of the wing formation, set course for their destination. Nearin the target the formation was aggressively attacked by approximately fifty (50) enemy aircraft, firing rockets, cannon and heavy machine guns, in a desperate effort to break up and destroy the bomber formation before the objective was reached. Displaying outstanding courage and determination, realizing the strategic importance of their task, the gallant crew battled their way through to the target. Despite the persistence of the fighter attacks, the intense barrage of enemh flak and partial concealment of the target by a smoke screen, the group continued for a highly successful bombing run, inflicting grave damage to vital enemy installations, supplies and equipment. Throughout the aerial battle, these gallant crews, in the heroic defense of their aircraft, destroyed a total of twenty-seven (27) enemy fighters and probably destroyed or damaged many more, thus holding our losses to a minimum for such a long and extremely hazardous mission. By the conspicuous gallantry, professional skill and determination of the combat crews, together with the superior technical skill and devotion to duty of the ground personnel, the 450th Bombardment Group has reflected great credit upon itself and the Armed forces of the United States of America.

In connection with the counter air offensive against vitally import and high priority targets in Germany, the 483rd Bombardment Group (H) was ordered to attach and destroy the enemy airdrome and installations at Memmingen. En route to the target, the Group became separated from the other Groups in the formation and from the fighter escort by extremely severe and adverse weather conditions. Alone, the Group proceeded to the target area where it was aggressively attached by approximately two hundred (200) enemy fighters. In the air battle which ensued, gunners of the Group shot down or damaged sixty-six (66) enemy aircraft at the same time losing fourteen (14) airplanes with their entire crews. Undismayed by the ferocity and viciousness of the attack and in spite of the severe losses suffered, the remainder of the Group proceeded, and with great heroism, gallantry and determination, carried out the bombing attack as ordered, though under the concentrated gunfire of the entire enemy fighter force. The bombs were dropped on the target with devastating effect, destroying all major installations and destroying or damaging an additional thirty-five (35) grounded enemy aircraft. Throughout the entire action which was carried out with exceptional gallantry and determination, and in spite of overwhelming opposition, crew esprit and individual heroism could not be excelled.

        "For outstanding performance of duty in action in the Philippine Islands on 16 and 17 February 1945. As part of the campaign to liberate Luzon it was necessary that American forces retake from the Japanese the historic island fortress of Corregidor at the mouth of Manila Bay so as to open the port of Manila to Allied shipping. The 317th Troop Carrier Group was assigned the mission of transporting and dropping the parachute troops who were to land on the plateau at the western end of the rocky island. Successful accomplishment of the operation demanded thorough preparation, sound judgment, and exceptional flying skill on the part of the crews of the C-47\u2019s. The 2 zones into which the paratroopers and their supplies were to be placed were of such small size that each plane had to come over the target individually and drop not more than 8 men on each pass. Corregidor, with its multitude of caves, tunnels, and dug-in positions, afforded ideal concealment for anti-aircraft gunners and was a hazardous target over which to fly unarmed, unarmored C-47\u2019s at a height of only 400 to 600 feet above the dropping zones. On the morning of 16 February, 51 of the group\u2019s C-47\u2019s dropped a total of 1,021 paratroopers and 151 bundles of supplies in a period of one hour, more than 92 percent of the troops and supplies landing in the designated areas. In a period of nearly 1\u00bd hours on the afternoon of the same day 50 C-47\u2019s dropped 978 paratroopers and 159 bundles, 94 percent of the men and supplies landing in the target zones. On the morning of 17 February, 43 C-47s dropped 197 bundles of supplies in less than an hour; 95 percent to 98 percent hit the target. On the afternoon of 17 February, during a period of nearly 2\u00bd hours, 785 bundles of supplies were dropped by 33 C-47s, 98 percent landing in the target zones. In all, approximately 563 separate passes had to be made to put the 1,999 paratroopers and 1,292 bundles on Corregidor. Anti-aircraft and small arms fire from the desperate and fanatical Japanese defenders of the island damaged 25 of the transports. The outstanding courage and superb flying skill of its air crews and the tireless determination and exemplary technical proficiency of its ground echelon enabled the 317th Troop Carrier Group to play a significant role in the liberation of Luzon. Its achievements have brought great honor to the armed forces of the United States. By direction of the President, under the provisions of Executive Order No. 9396 (Section I, Bulletin 22, WD, 1943), superseding Executive Order No. 9075 (Section III, Bulletin 2, WD, 1942), and of Section IV, Circular No. 333, WD, 1943, the following units are cited by the Commanding General, Far East Air Forces:"

        "Starting with a flashback, we see Henry and Abby are best friends. His parents come to pick him up, and through glances, it is obvious that Abby's mother and Henry's adoptive mother know what happened. Henry and Abby share a secret before he goes back home to Tacoma. Wakefield and Henry are discussing their overall plan when they hear Abby and they leave Trish's body in the woods. Shea and Madison make to the boat house where Sully learns Wakefield has escaped. Abby and Jimmy find Trish's body, and decide to leave her there to find Henry. Meanwhile, Sully sends Shea and Madison off towards Seattle on a small boat, while Henry takes Sully into the woods to \"find Trish.\" There, Henry tells Sully everything, but he doesn't believe him at first. Eventually he tries to shoot Henry, but Henry removed the bullets at the boathouse. Henry and his father kill Sully while Henry tells him \"you never should have dogged Trish,\" leading the audience to believe that Henry cared for Trish. Abby and Jimmy then come across Henry, who is alone. He doesn't seem to believe them when they tell him Trish is dead. Instead, he runs to the church where Trish's body is. There Abby, Jimmy, and Henry are found by Wakefield. Wakefield attacks Jimmy, who yells for Abby to run. When she leaves the church, Wakefield yells at Henry that Abby is escaping. Jimmy connects the dots, and fights off Wakefield while Henry runs to find Abby. Henry catches up to Abby and instead of killing her, kills Wakefield, who is surprised. Abby pieces everything together and tries to run from Henry, but she is knocked unconscious. The scene shifts to Shea and Madison who are informed that they are the only survivors, other than a handful of locals. The scene shifts yet again to Abby, who wakes in a house. Downstairs, she finds Henry. He explains that they were meant to be together, and that no one knows they are half-siblings, which makes everything okay. Attempting to escape, she finds Jimmy who is tied up. Henry has him sign a full confession in exchange for keeping Abby safe. Henry gets jealous when Abby admits she loves Jimmy and he slaps her. While on the floor, Abby stabs Henry in the foot. Having slipped Jimmy tools to help him unlock himself, Abby leads Henry on a chase, where she tells him that she doesn't want or love him. Distraught, he doesn't notice Jimmy coming up on him, and together, Henry and Jimmy go off a cliff. While checking on Jimmy, Henry walks up behind Abby and she stabs him. His last words to her are \"Abby, I love you.\" Abby and Jimmy make it off the island safely.

With no reserve available to be committed in their zone of action during the ensuing 8 days, the gallant officers and men of this team fought their way forward through a maze of hostile caves and pillboxes and over rugged terrain to secure Fonte Canyon and the northeastern slopes of Fonte Ridge despite constant mortar, machine-gun, small-arms and artillery fire which blasted all echelons, shore party and lines of communication and supply. Seriously depleted by heavy casualties, including two battalion commanders, the 3rd Combat Team was continually in action as the left assault regiment until the cessation of organized resistance and the securing of the island on August 10, after 21 days of furious combat. By their effective teamwork, aggressive fighting spirit and individual acts of heroism and daring, the men of the 3rd Combat Team achieved an illustrious record of courage and skill in keeping with the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service.\""

        "The 3rd Infantry Division and is supporting units distinguished themselves by extraordinary gallantry, valor, professionalism and esprit de corps displayed in the conduct of usually complex, difficult, and hazardous combat operation to liberate Iraq from 19 March 2003 to 1 May 2003. Relentlessly attacking over unforgiving terrain during extremely difficult weather conditions, the division advanced 750 kilometers while spearheading the Coalition\u2019s offensive. Continuously opposed by determined Iraqi forces using both conventional and unconventional tactics, under frequent threat of chemical attack, the soldiers of the 3d Infantry Division decisively won every engagement of every battle by virtue of their unequaled fighting spirit, dedication to duty, and commitment to their cause. Before the fighting ended, the division defeated or destroyed four Republican Guard Divisions, one Iraqi Regular Army Division, three Special Republican Guard Brigades, and thousands of fanatical paramilitary forces; sustaining few casualties, the 3d Infantry Division achieved one of the most stunning victories in military history. Aggressively attacking into the heart of Baghdad the division ultimately removed the brutal Iraqi regime from power, then rapidly transitioned to enforce law and order and help rebuild a shattered nation despite the constant threat of terrorist attacks. Its efforts have been instrumental in the success of Operation Iraqi Freedom. The courage, skill, and professionalism of the division\u2019s soldiers and its supporting units exemplify the highest traditions of military service and are in keeping with the finest tradition of the 3d Infantry Division \u201cRock of the Marne\u201d and the United States Army."

        "For extraordinary heroism and outstanding performance in action against enemy forces in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom from 21 March to 24 April 2003. During this period, I Marine Expeditionary Force (MEF) (REIN) conducted the longest sequence of coordinated combined arms overland attacks in the history of the Marine Corps. From the border between Kuwait and Iraq, to the culmination of hostilities north of Baghdad, I MEF advanced nearly 800 kilometers under sustained and heavy combat. Utilizing the devastating combat power of organic aviation assests, coupled with awesome power resident in the ground combat elements and maintaining momentum through the herculean efforts of combat service support elements, I MEF destroyed nine Iraqi divisions. This awesome display of combat power was accomplished while simultaneously freeing the Iraqi people from more than 30 years of oppression and reestablishing basic infrastructure in the country. During the 33 days of combat, to the transition to civil-military operations, I MEF sustained tempo of operations never before seen on the modern battlefield, conducting four major river crossings, maintaining the initiative, and sustaining forces. The ferocity and duration of the campaign was made possible through the skills and determination of the Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen, Marines, and Coalition Partners comprising I MEF at all levels, all echelons, and in all occupational fields. By their devotion to duty, the officers and enlisted personnel of I Marine Expeditionary Force (REIN) reflect great credit upon themselves and upheld the highest traditions of the Marine Corps and the United States Naval Service."

Meanwhile the doctor who examined Sebastian when bitten by a tiger reveals to Ciel and Sebastian that the artificial limbs he made for the performers were actually made from \"certain materials\": the bones of the kidnapped children. When the doctor kills a child, Ciel has a flashback of when he was nearly sacrificed and has a panic attack. Sebastian reminds him that he is now \"out of the cage\", and Ciel orders him to kill the doctor and Baron Kelvin. Sebastian does so, and hesitates when Ciel commands him to burn down the manor, as the kidnapped children are still imprisoned inside, but obeys. William looks at Joker's Cinematic Record on the days when Baron Kelvin had taken in him and his friends, and Ronald Knox appears; then they both prepare to collect the souls. Doll arrives at the burning manor, and Sebastian informs her that Joker and the other two were dead. Realizing that \"Smile\" was actually Ciel Phantomhive and that everything had been a lie, Doll breaks down and vows that she will never forgive Ciel, then attempts to kill him. Sebastian is seen walking away from the manor with Ciel, and it is implied that he killed Doll. The Undertaker is then seen watching the manor burn, as well as two men in white. Snake later on goes out to find the other performers, while Ciel and Sebastian go to the workhouse where Joker had said that several other adoptees were.

        "For outstanding performance in action against enemy forces from 29 May 2009 to 12 April 2010, in support of Operation ENDURING FREEDOM. Marine Expeditionary Brigade-Afghanistan conducted the most holistic counterinsurgency campaign since the Coalition presence in Afghanistan began in 2001. Operating in three separate austere provinces that had been bereft of government efficacy for years, the Brigade constructed expeditionary bases and air fields, and struck decisively at the heart of the Taliban insurgency with Operation KHANJAR in July 2009. Cities and hamlets across the region, from Now Zad to Khan Neshin, resumed regional commerce and schooling for children, and participated in national elections. Concurrent with kinetic fighting, the Brigade engaged tribal, religious, and government leaders with population-centric civil-military operations that synchronized developmental efforts across 58,000 square miles of battle-space. In February 2010, Operation MOSHTARAK reclaimed Marjah, a strategic agricultural hub and narco-terrorist safe haven in the Helmand River Valley. Together with thousands of Afghan National Security Forces, the Brigade tangibly improved the geo-political landscape of Southwestern Afghanistan. By their outstanding courage, aggressive fighting spirit, and untiring devotion to duty, the officers, enlisted personnel, and civilian employees of Marine Expeditionary Brigade-Afghanistan reflected great credit upon themselves and upheld the highest traditions of the Marine Corps and the United States Naval Service."

On the morning of. 23 April, the 1st Battalion was given the mission of cleaning out enemy pockets in the rear and on the right and left flanks of the 29th British Independent Brigade. After fighting fiercely the entire day, the battalion was ordered to attack an enemy force estimated to be composed of two regiments which had forced the withdrawal of friendly troops resulting in the entrapment of the Belgian United Nations Battalion. Under Intense enemy small-arms, automatic-weapons, mortar, and artillery fire, the battalion launched a night attack which was pressed with such aggressiveness, determination, and skill that the enemy was required to commit his entire force to meet the onslaught, thereby relieving pressure on the Belgian Battalion and allowing them to withdraw all equipment and vehicles. Following the withdrawal of the Belgian Battalion, and although surrounded on three sides by enemy troops, the 1st Battalion immediately started a brilliantly executed disengagement. The 1st Battalion inflicted such staggering losses on the enemy that he was unable to continue action in that area. On the afternoon of 24 April, the battalion, after a movement of some 15 miles, took up positions of the 7th Infantry Regiment's main line of resistance with the mission of holding a sector of this line. During the night of 24\u201325 April, the enemy hurled the might of two whole divisions against the 7th Infantry Regiment's front. Although the enemy had succeeded In infiltrating to the rear of the battalion and its right Bank was completely exposed, the 1st Battalion and attached units fought with magnificent tenacity and courage, holding in line until all other units of the 3d Infantry Division had withdrawn. When ordered, the battalion withdrew under a series of enemy attacks. This gallant unit killed over 3,000 enemy troops and wounded an estimated 5,500 of the enemy. The 1st Battalion, 7th Infantry Regiment, 3d Infantry Division, and attached units displayed such gallantry, determination, skill, and espirit de corps in accomplishing their mission under extremely difficult and hazardous conditions as to set them apart and above other units participating In the action, and reflect great credit on each courageous soldier thereof and the military service of. the United States.

On 23 November, the 2d Battalion, 7th Infantry, moved into defensive positions on a hill which was of vital importance to the ceasefire talks then in progress. Soon after assuming responsibility for this sector, the battalion was subjected to a heavy barrage of mortar and artillery fire as a prelude to a full-scale enemy attack. Shortly thereafter, an estimated two regiments of the enemy were observed moving frantically through their own supporting fire in an assault against the friendly positions. Wave after wave of the hostile troops came charging up the slope, only to be beaten back by the heavy fire poured into their ranks by the friendly force. The enemy, determined to take their objective at all costs, concentrated five battalions at one sector of the defense line and, under this tremendous pressure, one of the friendly companies was forced to execute a limited withdrawal to save itself from total annihilation, Although masses of the enemy were hurling themselves at the entire friendly line, the defenders, fighting fiercely against heavy odds, held them back except for this single penetration, The 2d Battalion, 15th Infantry, was immediately ordered to move forward and block the hostile troops attempting to push through the gap in the defense line. Upon reaching the area, one company immediately launched a spirited counterattack. Despite the heavy fire pouring down on them from all sides, the friendly troops pushed the enemy back steadily until the heavy casualties inflicted on them by the numerically superior hostile force made it necessary for them to halt their advance and occupy defensive positions on a newly won ridge. Another friendly company quickly moved through these positions and continued the attack until the enemy was repulsed and the breach in the friendly defense was closed. At this point, a fresh assault company advanced through the other two, who were in the process of consolidating their positions, and drove the enemy completely from the area with heavy casualties. The hostile force immediately launched a fierce counterattack but the friendly troops, exhibiting a matchless fighting spirit, repulsed the enemy repeatedly. Finally, seriously weakened by the tremendous casualties they had suffered, the hostile troops retreated, completely frustrated in their attempt to force the friendly troops from the strategic hill. In this action, approximately 2,000 of the enemy were killed, approximately 8,000 wounded, and 8 taken prisoner. The 2d Battalion, 7th Infantry, and the 2d Battalion,15th Infantry, 3d Infantry Division, and attached units displayed such superlative effectiveness in accomplishing their mission under extremely difficult and hazardous conditions as to set them apart and above other units participating in the action. The extraordinary heroism, singleness of purpose, and esprit de corps exhibited by the members of these units reflect great credit on themselves and are in keeping with the most esteemed traditions of the military service.

On the evening of 30 June, the 3d Battalion and attached units commenced their assigned mission which was to attack and seize Hill 717, the commanding terrain feature of the Chorwon-Kumhwa-Pyonggang area. A previous attempt by a friendly battalion to secure this vital objective had been unsuccessful because of the numerical superiority of the enemy force. Advancing nearly yards (m) over rugged and uncertain terrain in darkness, while continually under intense enemy small-arms, automatic-weapons, artillery, and mortar fire, the battalion and attached units moved up the precipitous slopes and pressed the attack with such aggressiveness, determination, and skill that the enemy was forced to abandon carefully prepared entrenchments. Throughout the night of1 July, the hostile force savagely counterattacked, attempting to dislodge the battalion and attached units from their precarious positions on the slopes of Hill 717. On the morning of 2 July, the battalion and attached units resumed their assault against the enemy's fortified hill positions. Even though they had suffered severely from the previous night's engagement, these gallant units, imbued with a steadfast determination, continued to advance against vast numbers of the enemy, inflicting staggering losses on the hostile force. In order to supplement its seriously depleted force, the enemy was forced to commit additional reserves to prevent the seizure of this important hill by the friendly forces. The battle continued to rage throughout the night of 2 July, with the enemy force hurling its entire might against the 3d Battalion and attached units, repeatedly charging down on the friendly forces in suicidal waves. In the face of tremendous odds, the valiant members of these units engaged the enemy in hand-to-hand combat with such magnificent tenacity and courage that their positions remained intact and the enemy was repulsed with heavy casualties. The fierce battle went on until, late in the afternoon of 3 July, the stubbornly resisting hostile force was routed from its strongly defended hilltop emplacements. After repulsing several enemy counterattacks during the night, the positions of the friendly units were consolidated on 4 July. Throughout this heroic engagement, more than 1,500 casualties were inflicted on the hostile troops. The 3d Battalion, 7th Infantry Regiment, 3d Infantry Division, and attached units displayed such gallantry, determination, and esprit de corps in accomplishing their mission under extremely difficult and hazardous conditions as to set them apart and above other units participating in the action. The extraordinary heroism displayed by all members of these units reflects great credit on them selves and upholds the highest traditions of the military service.

Serving as a blocking element to deny hostile forces approach routes into Saigon and portions of Binh Chanh District, Company D and attached units repeatedly displayed outstanding acts of valor against superior forces in offensive, defensive, and ambush operations. During the period nine major contacts were made with elements of four North Vietnamese Army battalions and in each instance the enemy forces were routed from the battlefield by the aggressive action, teamwork, firepower, spirit, heroism, and outstanding tactics of the combined arms team. Maintaining pressure on the enemy forces to prevent their withdrawal, Company D dispersed and demoralized the units and prevented their reorganization, while killing 181 North Vietnamese Army soldiers and capturing ten prisoners of war, numerous weapons, equipment, and ammunition. Throughout the prolonged period of savage fighting the men of Company D by their relentless determination, undaunted courage and aggressive spirit performed countless acts of heroism as they defeated enemy forces with numerically superior automatic weapons, small arms, mortar and rocket fire. These actions significantly contributed to the overall defense of Saigon. The extraordinary heroism, devotion to duty, and determination of all personnel of Company D and attached units reflect great credit upon themselves, their units and the United States Army.

Company C was engaged by a battalion of the 272nd Regiment of the North Vietnamese Army which was fighting from a sheltered and fortified bunker complex. The North Vietnamese had resisted hours of air support and artillery fire and was expected to overwhelm Company C, unless they were relieved. Company C's ammunition was running low, and was not mobile due to numerous casualties. A lack of landing zones precluded relief or retreat. Troop A made a 4km march through difficult jungle terrain to mount a direct assault into the fortified North Vietnamese Army position. Outnumbered three to one, Troop A's attack placed them into close range of the concealed defenders. Despite sustained small-arms, rocket-propelled grenade, and recoilless rifle fire, Troop A rendered the North Vietnamese Army unit combat ineffective. At dusk, following the assault, Troop A executed a night march to evacuate the dead and wounded."

Throughout this period, Observation Squadron SIXTY-SEVEN (VO-67), operating in the Republic of Vietnam, successfully executed its primary mission of providing quick reaction, close air support, and combat logistics support for United States and Vietnamese military forces. In the face of extremely harsh climatic conditions at a remote operating base, while sustaining extensive operating damage and losses, the flight crews and ground support personnel of VO-67 carried out their highly important and extremely sensitive missions with outstanding skill and dedication. The Squadron flew countless missions implanting newly developed sensors to detect enemy movement. The support provided by VO-67 was instrumental in supplying real-time intelligence regarding the movement of North Vietnamese troops and supplies, which enabled U.S. Forces to prevent the total invasion of the U.S. Marine Combat Base at Khe Sanh during the Tet Offensive and contributed to saving countless lives. The squadron's operations were consistently characterized by prudent tactics while maintaining meticulous adherence to the rules of engagement, ensuring maximum deterrence of the enemy with minimum risk to friendly troops and civilians. VO-67' s successful initiation of this new mission provided a significant and vital contribution to the art of warfare. By their outstanding courage, resourcefulness, and aggressive fighting spirit in combat against a frequently well-equipped, well-trained, and often numerically superior enemy, the officers and enlisted personnel of Observation Squadron SIXTY-SEVEN reflected great credit upon themselves and upheld the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service."

Throughout this period, the Third Marine Division (Reinforced), operating in the five northermost provinces of the Republic of Vietnam, successfully executed its three-fold mission of occupying and defending key terrain, seeking out and destroying the enemy, and conducting an intensive pacification program. Operating in an area bordered by over 200 miles of South China Sea coastline, the mountainous Laotian border and the Demilitarized Zone, the Third Marine Division (Reinforced) successfully executed eighty major combat operations, carrying the battle to the enemy, destroying many of his forces, and capturing thousands of tons of weapons and material. In addition to these major operations, more than 125,000 offensive counterguerrilla actions, ranging from squad patrols and ambushes to company-sizes search and destroy operations, were conducted in both the coastal rice lands and the mountainous jungle inland. These bitterly contested actions routed the enemy from his well-entrenched positions, denied him access to his source of food, restricted his freedom of movement, and removed his influence from the heavily populated areas. In numerous operations, the Third marine Division (Reinforced) demonstrated the great efficacy of combined operations with units of the Army of the Republic of Vietnam. In July 1966, the Third marine Division (Reinforced) moved to the north to counter major elements of the North Vietnamese Army moving across the Demilitarized Zone into the Province of Quang Tri; its units fought a series of savage battles against the enemy, repeatedly distinguishing themselves and, time and again, forcing the enemy to retreat across the Demilitarized Zone. Imbued with an unrelenting combat spirit and initiative and undeterred by heavy hostile artillery and mortar fire, extremely difficult terrain, incessant heat and monsoon rains, the Third marine Division (Reinforced), employing courageous ground, heliborne and amphibious assaults, complemented by intense and accurate air, artillery and naval gunfire support, inflicted great losses on the enemy and denied him the political and militart victory he sought to achieve at any cost. The outstanding courage, resourcefulness and aggressive fighting spirit of the officers and men of the Third marine Division (Reinforced) in battle after battle againsta well-equipped and well-trained enemy, often numerically superior in strength, and the great humanitarianism constantly shown to the people of the Republic of Vietnam, reflected great credit upon the Marine Corps and were in keeping with the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service."

Throughout this period, the First Marine Aircraft Wing, operating in I and II Corps tactical -zones of the Republic of Vietnam, North Vietnam, and adjacent waters, sought out and destroyed determined enemy forces and provided combat air support to ground forces of the Free World and the Republic of Vietnam. Participating in 195 major operations, and thousands of other attacks, the Wing continuously and aggressively carried the battle to the elusive enemy in bitterly contested actions. Operations such as DOUBLE EAGLE, HARVEST MOON, STARLITE, HASTINGS, PRAIRIE, UNION, HICKORY, COCHISE, AND SWIFT, reflect the high degree of superior airmanship, valor, devotion to duty and professionalism exhibited by personnel of the Wing. Although heavily committed to increased combat operations, the Wing developed and successfully employed new weapons, tactics, and procedures against the hard-core communist forces with gratifying results. Through the aggressive actions of the Wing, military and political victories were denied the insurgent communist forces, thereby providing a more stable atmosphere for the legally constituted Government of the Republic of Vietnam. The establishment, and logistical support of many separate airfields throughout the I Corps tactical zone and the vital air supply support provided the III Marine Amphibious Force and its allied ground forces, was a tribute to the resourcefulness and determination of the Wing. This dependable support was provided under the most trying and difficult combat conditions. Flying in fair weather and foul, against a fanatical, well-armed enemy, the uncommon courage and intrepidity of the Marine pilots and supporting Wing personnel, acting in a concerted team effort, contributed to another glorious chapter in an already illustrious history. The valor, devotion to duty, aggressive spirit, professionalism, and ingenuity of the entire First Marine Aircraft Wing in battle against a well trained, dangerous, and determined enemy, reflected the highest degree of heroism and exemplary performance, and were in keeping with the highest traditions of the Marine Corps and the United States Naval Service."

Throughout the Tet (Lunar New Year) Offensive, the Mobile Riverine Force (MRF) was locked in nearly continuous combat as the enemy lay siege to or threatened to attack every large population center and military installation in the Delta. During this hectic, 35-day campaign, the MRF played a vital role in driving the enemy out of My Tho and Vinh Long, the most severely ravaged of all the Delta cities, and in preventing enemy forces from launching sustained attacks on Can Tho, Binh Thuy, Sa Dec, Cai Be, Cai Lay, the Army Base at Dong Tam, and many other less-populated areas. In every battle, MRF personnel, both individually and collectively, although often matched against forces of much greater size than their own, displayed outstanding courage and professionalism in subduing the Viet Cong challenge. Navy crewmen embarked in Monitors, Command and Communication Boats, Assault Support Patrol Boats, and Armored Troop Carriers were frequently ambushed at point-blank range from concealed positions along both banks of the narrow, jungle-enshrouded Delta streams. In each instance, they succeeded in suppressing the enemy fire before maneuvering their assault craft out of ambush areas. Together, the MRF Army/Navy team successfully met the challenge posed by the Tet Offensive, probably saving the Delta from being overrun by insurgent forces. The gallantry, professionalism, courage under fire, and devotion to duty displayed by the officers and men of the United States Navy Element of the Mobile Riverine Force were in keeping with the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service."

Although the enemy possessed many tactical advantages due to an intimate knowledge of the area and detailed long range planning, his offensive was shattered within 5 weeks of its inception. In the Provincial capital of My Tho, 2d Brigade soldiers fought in a crowded city, an unfamiliar environment for infantry who were trained to fight primarily in a riverine environment. After restoring the security of the western sector of the city, the riverine forces commenced successive operations against enemy movements. At Cai Lai, they disrupted enemy attempts at regrouping. Strikes in and around Vinh Long and My Tho collapsed maturing enemy offensives which threatened these two key cities. Finally the riverine forces moved to the relief of the city of Can Tho, where, in 3 weeks of virtually continuous combat, the heaviest enemy attack of the entire Delta offensive was broken. The 2d Brigade engaged the enemy wherever he could be found and inflicted heavy casualties. The achievements of the riverine forces in turning back the enemy offensive represent a key factor in the operations that saved the Delta.

Essential to a large scale exploitation of his break-through into Belgium and northern Luxembourg, the enemy attempted to seize Bastogne by attacking constantly and savagely with the best of his armor and infantry. Without benefit of prepared defenses, facing almost overwhelming odds and with very limited and fast dwindling supplies, these units maintained a high combat morale and an impenetrable defense, despite extremely heavy bombing, intense artillery fire, and constant attacks from infantry and armor on all sides of their completely cut off and encircled position. This masterful and grimly determined defense denied the enemy even momentary success in an operation for which he paid dearly in men, material, and eventually morale. The outstanding courage and resourcefulness and undaunted determination of this gallant force is in keeping with the highest traditions of the service.

Company E was given the mission of making a diversionary attack to weaken enemy pressure along a sector in which the main effort was to be made by another Regiment for the purpose of completing the encirclement of Aachen, Germany. Enemy observation was excellent and the nature of the terrain made the attack extremely hazardous. Enemy fire was exceptionally heavy and caused many casualties within the company. Displaying unexcelled personal courage, the company launched five attacks against the numerically superior enemy and though control and direction were extremely difficult due to the unfavorable terrain and heavy enemy fire, their attacks succeeded in diverting much of the enemy's fire from the main effort, although at the cost of heavy casualties to the company. The individual heroism exhibited in this engagement reflects great credit on each participant and is in keeping with the high traditions of the Military Service."

III, WD Bul, 11, 1942), the following unit is cited by the War Department for outstanding performance of duty in action during the period indicated under provisions of section IV, WD Circular 333, 1943, In the name of the President of the United States as public evidence of deserved honor and distinction. The citation reads as follows: The 3rd Infantry Division with the following-attached units: 254 Infantry Regiment, 99th Chemical Battalion, 168th Chemical Smoke Generator Company, 441st Antiaircraft Artillery Automatic Weapons Battalion, 601st Tank Destroyer Battalion (SP), 756th Tank Battalion, IPW Team 183, fighting incessantly, from 22 January-6 February 1945, in heavy snow storms, through enemy-infested marshes and woods, and over a flat plain crisscrossed by numerous small canals, irrigation ditches, and unfordable streams, terrain ideally suited to the defense, breached the German defense wall on the northern perimeter of the Colmar bridgehead and drove forward to isolate Colmar from the Rhine. Crossing the Fecht River from Guemar, Alsace, by stealth during the late hours of darkness of 22 January, the assault elements fought their way forward against mounting resistance. Reaching the Ill River, a bridge was thrown across but collapsed before armor could pass to the support of two battalions of the 80th Infantry on the far side. Isolated and attacked by a full German Panzer brigade, outnumbered and outgunned, these valiant troops were forced back yard by yard. Wave after wave of armor and infantry was hurled against them but despite hopeless odds the regiment held tenaciously to its bridgehead. Driving forward in knee-deep snow, which masked acres of densely sown mines, the 3d Infantry Division fought from house to house and street to street in the fortress towns of the Alsatian Plain. Under furious concentrations of supporting fire, assault troops crossed the Colmar Canal in rubber boats during the night of 29 January. Driving relentlessly forward, six towns were captured within eight hours, 500 casualties inflicted on the enemy during the day, and large quantities of booty seized. Slashing through to the Rhone-Rhine Canal, the garrison at Colmar was cut off and the fall of the city assured. Shifting the direction of attack, the division moved south between the Rhone-Rhine Canal and the Rhine toward Neuf Brisach and the Brisach Bridge. Synchronizing the attacks, the bridge was seized and Neuf Brisach captured by crossing the protecting moat and scaling the medieval walls by ladder. In one of the hardest fought and bloodiest campaigns of the war, the 3d Infantry Division annihilated three enemy divisions, partially destroyed three others, captured over 4,000 prisoners, and inflicted more than 7,500 casualties on the enemy."

Air forces, by repeatedly attacking the enemy ground forces and installations, by destroying his convoys attempting reinforcement and supply, and by transporting ground forces and supplies to areas for which land routes were non-existent and sea routes slow and hazardous, made possible the success of the ground operations. Service units, operating far forward of their normal positions and at times in advance of ground combat elements, built landing fields in the jungle, established and operated supply points, and provided for the hospitalization and evacuation of the wounded and sick. The courage, spirit, and devotion to duty of all elements of the command made possible the complete victory attained.\""

Combat Command B, 7th Armored Division, was subjected to repeated tank and infantry attacks, which grew in intensity as the German forces attempted to destroy the stubborn defenses that were denying to them the use of the key communication center at St. Vith. By the second day, the flanks were constantly threatened by enemy forces that had bypassed the St. Vith area and pushed far to the rear in an effort to encircle the command east of the Salm River. The attacking forces were repeatedly thrown back by the gallant troops who rose from their fox holes and fought in fierce hand to hand combat to stop the penetrations and inflict heavy losses on the numerically superior foe. As the command continued to deny the important St. Vith highway and railroad center to the Germans, the entire offensive lost its initial impetus and their supply columns became immobilized. By 21 December, the German timetable was so disrupted that the enemy was forced to divert a corps to the capture of St. Vith. Under extreme pressure from overwhelming forces, this command, which for 6 days had held the St. Vith area so gallantly, was ordered to withdraw west of the Salm River. By their epic stand, without prepared defenses and despite heavy casualties, Combat Command B,. 7th Armored Division inflicted crippling losses and imposed great delay upon the enemy by a masterful and grimly determined defense in keeping with the highest traditions of the Army of the United States.\""

The citation is as follows: The First Battalion, 504th Parachute Infantry (less Company \u201cA\u201d) is cited for outstanding performance of duty in action against the enemy on 20\u201321 December 1944, at Cheneux, Belgium. This force was ordered to seize and occupy the town which is situated on hilly terrain and was defended by a heavily reinforced battalion of armored SS Troops supported by a Mark VI tank, numerous machine guns, SP 20mm guns, SP 77mm guns, and 105mm howitzers. The position was further defended in depth by armored halftracks mounting triple 20mm cannon and SP 81mm mortars. The battalion attacked Cheneux in echelons of assault waves and stormed the strongly emplaced enemy through the heavy fire of 20mm cannon, machine gun, mortar and small arms. The first three waves suffered severe losses as they charged across 400 yards of open fields fenced with barbed wire. Despite heavy losses, these airborne soldiers kept going with grim determination, each succeeding wave getting closer until the enemy and his armored vehicles and cannon were finally overwhelmed in fierce hand-to-hand combat. When ammunition ran low the troopers drove the enemy from almost impregnable positions with bayonets and clubbed rifles. The stubborn enemy was completely routed from his perimeter defenses and the attack continued until a portion of Cheneux was seized, where reorganization was effected and preparations made for a counter-attack. At dawn, the enemy laid down a heavy artillery preparation, then launched five successive counter-attacks through the day. All of these were repelled and at dusk this undaunted force continued the attack and drove the Germans from the town and nearby high ground. In this battle for CHENEUX, the First Battalion of the 504th Parachute Infantry (less Company \u201cA\u201d), destroyed five companies of German SS Armored troops and large quantities of artillery, vehicles and one Mark VI tank. They sealed a trap for thirty tanks and ninety-five vehicles which were eventually completely destroyed. This airborne force sustained heavy casualties in the engagement, but, despite these losses and the fanatical ferocity with which the enemy defended key positions, it prevailed in a most outstanding manner through superb discipline, skill and teamwork. The superior fortitude, unparalleled \u00e9lan and individual feats of gallantry and high courage on the part of every man and officer reflect credit on the traditions of the airborne forces of the United States Army."

This company crossed the Rhine River at 02\u201330 hours 6 April 1945, and seized the mile-long town of Hitdorf on the east shore with the mission of providing a base for further patrolling and to cause the German High Command to commit disproportionate forces against them in the belief that it was to be a major river crossing. The enemy immediately counter-attacked, but the assault groups were met with great vigor and virtually destroyed to a man. Apparently under the impression that a strong American bridgehead had been established overnight, the Germans assembled and directed a considerable portion of two divisions to the mission of containing and annihilating the formidable thrust. In mid-afternoon the entire area was subjected to a withering and devastating artillery barrage for two hours after which counter-attacking forces in overwhelming strength with tank support assaulted the defending troopers from every direction and penetrated to the heart of the town. The troopers of Company A doggedly stood their ground, fought at close quarters, and at point blank range and inflicted terrible casualties on the masses of the enemy. Fighting with relentless ferocity throughout the afternoon and night, this gallant company held its ground and carried out its mission until it was finally ordered to withdraw to the west bank of the Rhine on the night of 6\u20137 April. Fighting was bitter and at close quarters. The German armor committed was destroyed with hand weapons, most of the troopers using captured German panzerfausts. The company fought its way back step by step during the hours of darkness to their boats. The courageous and skillful efforts of the officers and men of this brave group, although outnumbered numerically at least eight to one, is reflected in the total number of casualties inflicted on the German forces during the day's fighting . Eighty prisoners were taken and evacuated and conservative estimates indicate that 150 of the enemy were killed and 250 wounded. The conduct of Company A reflects great credit on the Airborne Forces of the United States Army."

        "War Department General Orders 56, 17 June 1946: 23 October to 11 November 1944 - Even though the engineers sustained 57 casualties in dead and wounded, they captured 27 German prisoners and killed many more as they worked. Almost continuous rain and snow made their task more difficult, and yet by sheer determination and grit, these men accomplished this magnificent feat of engineering. Without this road, the division operation could not have succeeded and it is due to the extraordinary achievement of the 11th Engineer Combat Battalion with the 232d Engineer Combat Company (attached) that the 36th Division was able to outflank the enemy forces in the Laveline-Corcieux Valley and pursue a disorganized enemy to the banks of the Meurthe River."
