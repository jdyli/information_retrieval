Upwind riders adopt a similar stance to kite fliers onshore, who slide their feet forward in the beach sand to brake the kite.

When \"unhooked\" the rider steers the kite using their arms with no depower, which can be very strenuous.",

With a harness, recovering from a fall or when maneuvering (jibing, tacking) the rider needs to detach the harness completely from the sail, which means that both traction and steering forces are to be countered solely by the rider's muscle. Hooking into the harness again requires additional muscle effort. For jibing maneuvers, muscle effort diminishes as the rider becomes more skilled in maintaining board speed in the jibe."

However, in stronger winds, uphauling the sail increasingly requires strength, so water starting is a better option. This means positioning the board-sail combination through aligning the sail into the right wind angle, allowing the wind to pull the body out of the water onto the board using the sail, and then easily hooking back in and stepping into foot straps."

The \"stern\" of the board now becomes the \"bow\", so the feet can be kept in the footstraps. Since the windward edge of the board doesn't change sides, the terms \"jibing\" or \"tacking\" are somewhat of a misnomer. Falling into the water is not a major problem, as even beginning riders can quickly and fairly effortlessly execute a water start using the kite to pull them out of the water.",

With some aerobatics like the barrel roll, the rider needs to jump sufficiently high to allow the full length of the mast to rotate forward underneath. Often the risks to the rider of having fast moving and relatively heavy (board + mast + sail) gear so close by are substantial. None of this is similar to any action onshore, and therefore the learning curve is very shallow.

Also, they can emergency stop almost immediately. Experienced riders will do this by 'crashing' (with some risk to themselves) while beginning riders (who typically do not wear a harness) can depower the sail instantly by releasing the back hand or letting the mast fall on water. The risk of hitting hard objects or other water-goers is therefore minimal."

Recovery from falling is easy with a little practice, as the rider needs to either up haul the sail standing on the board or water start, which both take some strength and balance. Water starting is an advanced technique that just takes some teachable techniques and practice. At the same time, the risk of falling is always there (experts can go days without a fall but a missed jibe might happen). Tacking becomes more difficult in stronger winds, so most riders switch to easy jibes."

If they do, they will often exclude passengers from the vehicle. Several different sails and boards (and often masts and booms) are necessary to cover the full range of rideable conditions."
