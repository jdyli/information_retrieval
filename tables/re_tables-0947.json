But when Grace speaks to Emily, she learns that the only reason she didn't object was that Matthew seemed so adamant about marrying this woman.

Grace runs into Bev, Quentin's girlfriend's mother, at the pharmacy. Bev tells her she's feeling suffocated in her marriage; being rich isn't that great. Grace has a hard time relating to Bev's problems. Grace is at home being driven crazy by Libby's trumpet practicing when Bev comes by and announces she'd like to stay with Grace for a while to get back to her middle class roots. Grace agrees to let her, though Quentin's upset to have to live under the same roof with his girlfriend's mother. It soon becomes clear that Bev is having as much trouble adapting to life at the Kellys as they are having her there. She takes two showers in the morning and depletes all the hot water and uses four towels a day. Grace thinks Bev could solve all her problems with an honest talk with her husband, but Bev disagrees.

      "The series begins from the point of view of the heroine\u2019s nemesis: aboard a warship (karakoa), an epic chanter exaggerates the accomplishments of her chieftain, Rajah Mangubat, in a soaring voice so as to intimidate his enemy the old chieftain, who is next seen bragging to his worried chief priestess (punong babaylan) Digan about his invincibility at war. A battle scene ensues between the two armies, whereby the old chieftain\u2019s gets decimated and he begs for his life. Irritated by such display of cowardice, Mangubat fatally strikes his enemy\u2019s diaphragm with a finger. The captive priestess Digan later warns Mangubat that a girl about to be born with a snake twin will rise and conquer him, a prophecy that warrants her death at the hands of the stunned rajah. The prophecy is soon reiterated by Hilway, the rajah\u2019s chief priestess herself, who, possessed by a deity, confirms Digan\u2019s warning in blood-curling terms. Meanwhile, in the community (banwa) ruled by the chieftain Datu Bugna, the slave Dal\u2019lang, Bugna\u2019s lover, is pregnant and the news reaches the ears of his wife, the equally pregnant Dian Lamitan, who urges her husband to offer his lover an abortifacient drink. When he violently refuses, Lamitan goes to Dal\u2019lang and orders the latter\u2019s friend to strike her until she bleeds, swearing to do so everyday until Dal\u2019lang stops seeing her husband. Lamitan makes this known to Bugna, who chooses instead to stop seeing Dal\u2019lang so as to ensure her safety and that of their child."

        "On the next harvest season, Dian Lamitan attempts to sell Dal\u2019lang off to traders but her brother-in-law Awi intervenes, saying that she can sell Dal\u2019lang but not her child since the child is a freeman (timawa), on account of being the offspring of a chieftain (datu) and a slave (uripon). Lamitan therefore has to wait before Dal\u2019lang delivers the child. Meanwhile, she heightens her cruelty towards the slave by asking the latter to be beaten on the fields, due to her supposed slovenly movements. This hastens Dal\u2019lang\u2019s labor so that she later delivers at the same time as Lamitan herself, who is disappointed to learn that her child is not the male heir she expected, naming the baby Binayaan (\u201cabandoned\u201d) instead. Meanwhile, Dal\u2019lang is surprised that her child, also a female baby she named Amaya, has a twin snake\u2014the girl stated in Digan\u2019s prophecy. A lunar eclipse occurs the whole time both babies are delivered and according to their beliefs, this is effected by the fishlike dragon Bakunawa that surges from the depths of its underworld home, Sulad, so as to swallow the moon. The people therefore have to make noises to scare the dragon into regurgitating the moon."

        "Rajah Mangubat meanwhile has been sailing the islands within his dominion, killing every pregnant woman to ensure that no baby with a snake twin is born. His adviser Atubang surmises that the eclipse must be the time when the baby is born since some ancestor spirits (umalagad) must have escaped from Sulad during the Bakunawa\u2019s absence, and one of them must have come out from some woman\u2019s womb as a snake twin. This prompts Mangubat to moor his vessels on the only island that they have spared, on account of his friendship with its ruler: Datu Bugna\u2019s. His search, however, fails yet again because Lamitan apparently has no such baby and she herself unwittingly prevents Mangubat from finding out about Dal\u2019lang\u2019s baby by retorting that the ancestor spirits are not that half-witted to allow themselves to be born out of a slave woman\u2019s womb. Alarmed at the prospect of Rajah Mangubat finding about his daughter and her snake twin, Datu Bugna takes the snake twin to the forest and the baby Amaya to his house to be reared as a binukot (cloistered prince), against Dal\u2019lang\u2019s vehement pleading."

Dal\u2019lang frantically goes to the chieftain\u2019s house to demand for Amaya but the guards bar her and Lamitan orders her to be brought to traders to be bartered off. To Datu Bugna\u2019s dismay, they later learn that Dal\u2019lang is \u201cdead\u201d after her traders strike her with their paddle when she attempts to escape and falls into the sea, never to be seen thereafter. Dal\u2019lang however, survives and reaches an island. Rajah Mangubat, on the other hand, is mortified to learn from his chief priestess that he has failed to hunt down the baby with a snake twin, and is instead told to accept his immutable fate."

        "Dal\u2019lang tries to construct a makeshift raft out of banana stalks in order to navigate out of the island back to her daughter, but a heavy rain frustrates her plans. Some years later, Rajah Mangubat berates his son Bagani for learning to play the kudyapi (a stringed instrument) and instead determines that the latter should earn his first batuk (tattoo) after killing a slave. On the other hand, Amaya grows cloistered in the bukot (room for a binukof princess) she shares with her half-sisters, the spiteful Marikit and the good-natured Binayaan. Dian Lamitan learns from her midwife that after Binayaan, she will never conceive again and thus her husband, who has learned this fact earlier, is no longer keen on sleeping with her. Datu Bugna\u2019s aloofness is heightened by his special tenderness for Amaya, which Lamitan easily notices, prompting her to order her slave to abduct Amaya and kill her, in exchange for his freedom."

Thus on pain of such penalty, the slave kills the guards in the bukot and takes Amaya, who has promised her father earlier that she would never let her feet touch the ground in keeping with her purity as a binukot. Without making her touch the ground, the slave carries the unconscious Amaya to a rock in the forest and is about to kill her when Amaya\u2019s twin snake appears and fatally bites the slave\u2019s foot. When she wakes up, she sees Bagani, who comes with Rajah Mangubat and his warriors on Amaya\u2019s island to earn his first batuk. Bagani, however, has freed the slave that he was supposed to kill and instead smears his weapon with the blood of Lamitan\u2019s slain slave in order to cover up for this. Accompanied by his father and the warriors, he carries Amaya to Datu Bugna who has been searching for her after Lamitan had made it appear that his daughter had fled her bukot. Bugna then brings Amaya home, to Lamitan\u2019s indignant surprise."

The latter congratulates him instead, saying that he respects life unlike his father. Datu Bugna, meanwhile, trains Amaya in the arts of warfare using rattan sticks and regularly does this until Amaya grows into a playful maiden. A nobleman later comes to ask for the hand of any of Datu Bugna\u2019s daughter, but the chieftain insists that the man can have any of his daughters except Amaya. Dian Lamitan overhears this and wonders what makes Amaya special to her father, especially since she has heard reports from Marikit about her husband\u2019s unusual affection for his illegitimate daughter. Amaya, who is aware of the bitter fact regarding her low birth, is assured by her father of her mother\u2019s love for her. Later that night Bugna is approached outside his house by a veiled figure who threatened to harm him. The figure is revealed to be Dal\u2019lang."

        "In reply to Datu Bugna\u2019s query, Dal\u2019lang recounts her lone survival on her island until she finds a capsized boat which she uses to return to his island. She also wishes to kill her former lover for his hand in taking her daughter away from her. After assuring her that Amaya is brought up well, Bugna refuses her demands to see her daughter, saying that it is better off that Lamitan knows her dead, or her life will be endangered again. Rejected, Dal\u2019lang later returns and overhears Amaya in her bukot singing a plaintive song about her mother. Overjoyed but feeling powerless to comfort her daughter, Dal\u2019lang recounts this to her friend Agang. Datu Bugna also tells his brother Awi about his meeting with Dal\u2019lang but vows to not to tell Amaya about this, as it will disrupt his daughter\u2019s training. Meanwhile, Rajah Mangubat gives Bagani an ultimatum of two full moons to find a bride or he himself would do the task. Compelled, Bagani proceeds on a bride search, but not before Bayang volunteered to read his palm in order to prognosticate the outcomes of his search. Bayang sees the figure of Amaya, describing her qualities in the process. But she is abruptly cut short upon seeing a phantom of Amaya\u2019s snake twin coiled in its sister's arm, explaining to the bewildered Bagani that she sees nothing more. When Ahak asks Amaya\u2019s permission to go with her boyfriend to a feast in the neighboring island, Amaya assents on condition that they take her with them."

        "Ahak initially refuses as the flan is against the proprieties of a binukot, but after much pleading from Amaya, she consents. Inasmuch as she cannot touch the ground, the princess (ba\u2019i) is carried by Ahak\u2019s boyfriend Kuling to a baroto (hewn boat) that night. While on the sea, they are spotted by Bagani and his retinue who are still embarking on his bride search. The latter remarks on Amaya\u2019s beauty comparing her to the moon, but the startled Amaya orders Kuling to row back. Offshore, they are met by the angry Datu Bugna who threatens to punish the slave couple for their intransigence. Amaya pleads for them with an admission of her guilt and a promise that she will not do it again. The chieftain begrudgingly takes heed and has his daughter returned to her bukot, which occasioned Dian Lamitan\u2019s sister Mantal to see her face. Mantal later remarks offhandedly about Amaya\u2019s beauty to Lamitan, who jealously storms inside the bukot to hurt Amaya, fumbling at how the latter reminds her of her old rival Dal\u2019lang, Amaya\u2019s mother."

        "Datu Bugna is being persuaded by a datu, an emissary of another rajah, to join forces with them against Rajah Mangubat, but the loyal Bugna refuses their proposal. He is then alerted about his wife\u2019s latest foray, and rushes to defend Amaya from the fuming Lamitan, even slapping his wife to stop. The humiliated Dian Lamitan recounts to Marikit how her father, Datu Puti, used to be a commoner (timawa), whose status was raised upon their marriage. She tells how the slight she has just received extinguishes the remaining love she has for her husband, and vows to punish him. Meanwhile, Bagani tells his parents that he has found the woman he wishes to marry (Amaya) and is given permission to affiance her with a chestful of gold. Dian Lamitan\u2019s vow later materialises through a false story she fabricates about her husband\u2019s planned rebellion against Rajah Mangubat, which she goes to tell the rajah himself. After asking Lamitan and Mantal to seek asylum in his community, the enraged ruler acts quickly, mobilizing his forces when he receives a favorable augury from his chief priestess. As their ships approach Datu Bugna\u2019s island, Amaya\u2019s snake twin sneaks into the bukot and communicates with Amaya, warning her to flee. Amaya is surprised that she can understand the reptile\u2019s message, and frantically tells her sisters and their slaves to run for their safety."

        "Datu Bugna goes with his warriors to meet the approaching raiders but is stunned to learn that that their leader is his friend Rajah Mangubat. When asked for an explanation, Mangubat states that the datu\u2019s own wife will not lie to the rajah, but Bugna vehemently insists his innocence. The unconvinced Mangubat forces him to confess against dire consequences. The rajah\u2019s order that his warriors bring Datu Bugna\u2019s binukot daughters serves the last straw for the embattled chieftain, who then signals his men to fight back, until he gets held at the point of Mangubat\u2019s sword. After laying waste to Bugna\u2019s community, Mangubat\u2019s warriors succeed in carrying off Amaya and Marikit, but not after Amaya hides Binayaan in a chest, where Dal\u2019lang later finds her and mistakes her for Amaya. Bugna pleads for his daughters\u2019 lives, at which point Amaya treads the ground (a taboo for a binukot) in order to console her father, but Mangubat grabs her instead and exchanges her life for her father\u2019s confession. Bugna tells Amaya that he would rather die dishonorably than see her hurt, and thus confesses, against Amaya\u2019s entreaties. This suffices for Mangubat to kill him, but before the second, fatal stab, Bugna is able to bid farewell to Amaya. When she is told that a traitor deserves no proper burial, Amaya endeavors to cut a lock of her father\u2019s hair and promises to see him again, by which time she will give him the treatment that he deserves."

        "Rajah Mangubat spares none of the lives of Datu Bugna\u2019s men, except old Awi, the chieftain\u2019s brother. By Dian Lamitan\u2019s earlier request, he herds Amaya among the slaves but gives Marikit a treatment proper to a binukot. Bagani arrives too late at Datu Bugna\u2019s island, where he intended to sojourn after conjecturing correctly that the maiden he saw at the sea that night, whom he heard was called Amaya, is the same girl who introduced herself as Amaya when he came to that island for his first kill. He gives Datu Bugna a fitting burial and departs after realizing that the unidentified raiders must have taken the chieftain\u2019s daughters, including Amaya. Later, some of Rajah Mangubat\u2019s warriors return to search for Binayaan, on Lamitan\u2019s request. However they fail on this mission as Dal\u2019lang has carried off Binayaan, who has falsely given her identity as Amaya. In Rajah Mangubat\u2019s community (puod), both Marikit and Amaya are stunned to learn that it is Lamitan\u2019s report that caused of their father\u2019s demise. But while Marikit\u2019s revulsion is countered by her mother\u2019s strong words saying that Bugna was never a father to her, Amaya vociferates her disgust to the triumphant Lamitan who announces that the rajah has allowed her to have her stepdaughter as her property (i.e., slave). As a sign of this, Lamitan has Amaya stripped in full view of the public."

        "Bagani has returned to learn the bewildering fact that the raiders of Datu Bugna\u2019s island is none other than his father and their warriors. He requests to have Amaya brought to him but during their meeting, the former binukot shows that she is not too keen on seeing the son of her father\u2019s murderer, especially when the latter tries to justify his father\u2019s actions. Angaway, the grandson of the chief priestess Hilway and one of the bravest warriors, has also seen Amaya and is interested in owning her, but Rajah Mangubat declines his request, citing the promise he earlier gave to Dian Lamitan. In the slaves\u2019 hovel, Amaya tells her former handmaid Ahak that Bagani is the man they have seen from the boat, but says that he has nothing but revulsion for him. Ahak laments the bitter fact that the man Amaya has professed to love turns out to be her enemy\u2019s son. Bagani likewise tells his retinue that Amaya is the woman they have seen from the boat and the binukot that they have been looking for, stating his cluelessness as to how he can still marry her now that circumstances have changed. Marikit asks to be carried to Amaya\u2019s hovel in order to have a look at her newly enslaved half-sister. On her way thereto, Bagani and his slaves walk past her and she feels instant attraction. At the slaves\u2019 quarters, Marikit began to spite and hurt Amaya but the latter reciprocates."

Amidst the other slaves\u2019 counsel on the futility of fighting back, Amaya downheartedly professes before the gloating Dian Lamitan that she is now her stepmother\u2019s slave. Bagani makes it known to Rajah Mangubat that Amaya is the princess he wishes to marry, to which the rajah responds with the strongest disapproval, even unsheathing his sword to place its blade next to his son\u2019s neck. Meanwhile, Amaya\u2019s twin snake, who has found its way into the rajah\u2019s island, stings a slave who expresses his carnal thoughts on Amaya. On Mangubat\u2019s orders, Hilway and her retinue of priestesses (babaylan) launch a search for the snake. At Dian Lamitan\u2019s house, Mantal reminds her sister as to the imprudence of excessively abusing Amaya. The irritated Lamitan asks Mantal to leave her alone, at which time she notices the presence of the snake on a beam in her room, and screams."

        "Rajah Mangubat\u2019s warriors fail to find the snake after it disappears when Dian Lamitan gives it a second glance. Instead they invite her to join the feast that Rajah Mangubat is throwing that evening for the successful raid at Datu Bugna\u2019s island (similar to the feast where Digan pronounced her prophecy years before). Marikit overhears it and asks her mother to let her come, learning that the rajah\u2019s son will be present. Mantal rebukes her niece\u2019s brazeness inappropriate for a binukot, but Lamitan contradicts her, pointing out the fragility of their status in the new community as a reason for them to make certain adjustments. As the feast is about to start, the slave Bayang fetches the disheartened Bagani to join the celebration and the latter confesses that Amaya is the binukot that he was looking for. Bayang replies that no good will come out of loving an enemy\u2019s daughter. At the feast, Marikit displays her willingness to become Bagani\u2019s wife by offering him her hairpiece (husay) but is refused, to the disappointment of both their parents. The slaves are then brought to be divided among the victors, and Bagani proclaims that he is willing to buy Amaya from her owner for whatever price it takes. Dian Lamitan expresses that Bagani can have her for free but the simmering Rajah Mangubat blurts that he will have none of it as he has given Lamitan his word. The other slaves are given out: Ahak and Kuling to the minister Atubang, and Awi to the rajah himself."

        "The morning after the feast, both Dian Lamitan and Marikit abuse Amaya on different occasions for the same reason: Bagani\u2019s explicit concern for her. Amaya reveals to Marikit that she has known Bagani since they were children but assures her that she feels nothing for him. Marikit haughtily orders Amaya not to call her sister (umbo) anymore, but princess (ba\u2019i), a title addressed by slaves, to which Amaya humbly complies. Rajah Mangubat reveals that the reason he spared Awi is that he owed him his life once, and consigns the old warrior to work in the shipyard. Ahak later visits Awi to talk about helping Amaya escape, but unlike before, Awi dissuades her from talking further about the matter. Bagani prepares food for Amaya, which Bayang volunteers to give her. Doing so, Bayang finally sees Amaya and confirms to the latter, after reading her palm, that she is indeed the prophesied woman with a snake twin. The startled Amaya expresses her unawareness and incredulity at this and refuses to accept Bagani\u2019s meal offer. Confused over Bayang\u2019s words, she remembers scattered clues from her past that favor the former apprentice\u2019s revelation when suddenly she sees the snake coiled in a post outside Lamitan\u2019s house."
