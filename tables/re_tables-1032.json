Five mangled, bloody teens appear and harass Tate, prompting the couple to leave. Vivien tells Ben that Hayden is in the house. Ben finds her in the basement, but Larry knocks him out with the shovel and ties him up. Nora frees him, urging him to save his child. Hayden appears to Vivien and both are shocked to learn that the other is pregnant with Ben\u2019s child. Hayden attacks her, but is stopped by Ben, who is forced to admit that he impregnated Hayden months after Vivien discovered the affair. The teens find Tate and Violet, but Tate protects Violet by making them chase him. Constance takes Violet to her house, revealing that Addie is dead and Tate is her son. The teens are revealed to be ghosts from various cliques at Westview High who were killed when Tate committed a school shooting in 1994. The ghosts angrily demand to know why he killed them and that he admit what he did, but Tate cannot remember anything about them. With Halloween night ending, the teens depart.

        "The story begins in the Swiss village of Rossini\u00e8re c. the final year of the 19th century where our heroine Annette Burnier is getting bootstrapped to begin her day by the reminder of a promise to catalyze the assumption of responsibility for the cows; a session of maternal criticism on the part of her pregnant mother Francine later, Annette rushes off to find her father Pierre milking the cows with the volition that she feed the cows. The conversation that Annette prosecutes with a neighbor becomes the vehicle by which Annette's best friend Lucien Morel is introduced as having much more dire misfortune since his family is without his dead father serving as the primary breadwinner and the man of the house -- the latter Lucien cannot easily fulfill as evidenced by the session of turbulent family government with his mother Elizabeth; while prosecuting the school commute, an ambush by the class bully Jean and the aftermath thereof becomes the backdrop against which Annette and Lucien's relationship is defined. Driven by his \"kill-the-king\" emphasis on the circumstantial epilogue, Lucien attempts an ill-planned prank with an estivating lizard to get even with Jean only to ultimately find himself facing Sensei Nicholas along with being embroiled in a vivacious adversarial divergent concourse with Annette after school; while Annette only has to worry about what to name her neonatal sibling, Lucien and his older sister Marie find themselves facing the urgent necessity of forestalling imminent homelessness to the tune of fifty francs.",

In spite of his good intentions, Pierre inadvertently ignites Annette's jealous ire with his promise to instruct Lucien in using a scythe and his obliviousness to Annette's umbrage at the covert sexism; while Pierre divides his energies toward prosecuting the journey to the cabin and wondering if he has possibly put his foot in his mouth, Claude and Mrs. Morel exchange prologues over a spot of tea as the two women get better acquainted with each other. The mountain cabin where Pierre will house himself with Annette and Lucien requires a lot of housekeeping before it becomes habitable; as has been previously demonstrated, Annette and Lucien's zealous refurbishment efforts stir up a huge dust cloud that stifles respiration and ends up reigniting the earlier adversarial divergent concourse. Pierre taking the time to guide Lucien through properly using the scythe while also charging the frustrated Annette vigilance over the cattle before leaving makes it clear that Annette has not learned that she cannot always have things her way -- particularly because Lucien has gleaned enough data to ascertain and ultimately stalemate her attempt to sweet-talk him into letting her use the scythe; now having been literally demonstrated an incidence of very weighty beef courtesy of the calf Rosette and a particularly steep declivity that requires a canine intercession from Pepper, Annette and Lucien realize the immense wisdom in burying the hatchet.",

Unnerved at the prospect of Santa Claus passing him over because of his poverty in spite of Pierre and Claude's reassurances, Daniel prosecutes a childish nocturnal ritual that involves placing a slipper outside; while there are no presents delivered him in the conventional sense, Daniel is nevertheless in seventh heaven when he finds that a baby ermine has taken refuge from the cold inside of his slipper the next morning. Annette and Daniel being swept up into the ecstasy of Pierre's ill-considered green light to house the ermine gives way to some dismaying back-end logistics -- the most crucial and fundamental of which is how to fuel the juvenile mammal; while Lucien is very smart to have piped up with the idea of securing a surrogate wet nurse at Moreau-ke, the innovation is nearly nullified when the house-cat in question is not slow in demonstrating its emphatic hostility!!! Even with having named the ermine Klaus and having found a way to fuel the small mammal, those accomplishments are ultimately of null utility when Klaus falls through the ice and has visited unto him a recalcitrant case of hypothermia which invokes significant guilt within Daniel who prosecutes a nocturnal search for crocus bulbs; a lengthy night's rest later, Klaus demonstrates that Daniel's prompt intercession and intense yearning for its full recovery is all the medicine it needs."

Upon learning of Annette accompanying Daniel, Lucien decides to research for the epilogue at Burnier-ke where Klaus's mischief nearly gives him away; had Lucien stayed to converse with Claude, he would have had explained that Daniel has matriculated into the semi-ambulatory stage of his recovery which requires crutches -- a task that Lucien could easily catalyze with his woodcarving prowess unlike Pierre who is burning the midnight oil.

Up in her room, Annette mentally kicks around the idea of sitting out the picnic -- a sentiment on which she and Lucien soon become as one mind; upon Sensei Nicholas objecting their recalcitrance, it soon becomes evident that revising the itinerary away from an at-altitude walkway overlooking a precipitous ravine is of wisdom as evidenced by Lucien's trembling. The epilogue of the whole field trip is that Annette and Lucien do want to ultimately reconcile but cannot get past the fact that Daniel is still badly damaged and that there are some long-standing unresolved issues; still, there begs the question of how to air out all of that laundry while keeping the culpability balanced between plaintiff and defendant.",

        "As would be expected of a child within its first half-decade, Daniel is not shy about indicating novel scenery features nor is he slow in recounting his previous adventure on the train much to Annette's chagrin; while en route to Montreux, Marie reminds Annette the importance of complying Dr. Givet's counsel about learning the lay of the land in Lausanne along with constant correspondence -- the latter being exactly what Claude and Pierre could use as they come to grips with how quiet Burnier-ke has become. Lucien fuming at Mr. Peguin teasing him about his infatuation with Annette gives way to the fact that the Burnier siblings have quite a syllabus ahead of them starting with the lead butler Willelm and the quantum leap of urban opulence that is Lausanne. The majesty of the Givet-ke mansion is quite tame compared to Dr. Givet's son Marc taking quite well to Klaus much to Daniel's delight while Annette is astonished at how much of a flawless emulation Dr. Givet's spouse Helena is of her late mother Francine!!!
