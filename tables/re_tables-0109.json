Louise accepts the mission, but Saito is reluctant to join the war because of what he had been told by the late Mr. Colbert. During the attack, Louise is unable to perform her Void magic; they are attacked by air fighters, and the Zero Fighter plane is forced to abort the mission and land in a snowfall. The Queen must then send her Army head on into battle. Governor Sheffield learns of a flying dragon made of steel (the crash-landed Zero fighter plane) and arranges to have it recovered. Saito and Louise found an enemy air fighter named Henry Stalford who is badly injured and unable to fight, and Saito carries him to safety and made truce with him. As the Albion troops arrive to recover the plane and kill the enemy, the two are rescued by Julio just in time. Henry hopes to see the two again someday.",

During the attack, Louise is unable to perform her Void magic; they are attacked by air fighters, and the Zero Fighter plane is forced to abort the mission and land in a snowfall. The Queen must then send her Army head on into battle. Governor Sheffield learns of a flying dragon made of steel (the crash-landed Zero fighter plane) and arranges to have it recovered. Saito and Louise found an enemy air fighter named Henry Stalford who is badly injured and unable to fight, and Saito carries him to safety and made truce with him. As the Albion troops arrive to recover the plane and kill the enemy, the two are rescued by Julio just in time. Henry hopes to see the two again someday.",

The next day, Siesta walks into Louise and Saito's room to see Louise sitting on the edge of the bed. Agnes arrives and inform Louise that she, Saito, and Tiffania are called on by Henrietta. The Queen tells them that the Pope has requested their urgent help, and calls upon Sylphid to escort them there. Upon reaching Romalia they see Aquileia being engulfed in flames and are attacked by a swarm of dragons. Julio rescues them from a fire blast launched by an enormous dragon and escorts them to Romalia. The Pope requests the trio's help to stop the legendary \"Ancient Dragon\" and asks Saito to use his new-found abilities, to which Louise objects. When they arrive at the location where they will confront the dragon, Louise informs Saito of the consequences of using Lifdrasir's power, but he agrees to use them to protect Romalia and Louise. The accompanying army trap the Ancient dragon in a valley, and the Pope uses his Void magic on the dragon and its army; it usually functions as a Recovery spell, but has a damaging effect against entities of evil. Tiffa uses her Memory spell to stop the dragon's army. Saito uses his powers to strengthen His Eminence, but the Ancient dragon possesses Julio's dragon, causing it to move towards the dragon's mouth as it begins blasting them with fire.

        "Louise and Saito are dancing in the grand ballroom after Tabitha's coronation, with Louise lost in the thought of Saito's life-risking Lifdrasir power. The next day, Siesta walks into Louise and Saito's room to see Louise sitting on the edge of the bed. Agnes arrives and inform Louise that she, Saito, and Tiffania are called on by Henrietta. The Queen tells them that the Pope has requested their urgent help, and calls upon Sylphid to escort them there. Upon reaching Romalia they see Aquileia being engulfed in flames and are attacked by a swarm of dragons. Julio rescues them from a fire blast launched by an enormous dragon and escorts them to Romalia. The Pope requests the trio's help to stop the legendary \"Ancient Dragon\" and asks Saito to use his new-found abilities, to which Louise objects. When they arrive at the location where they will confront the dragon, Louise informs Saito of the consequences of using Lifdrasir's power, but he agrees to use them to protect Romalia and Louise. The accompanying army trap the Ancient dragon in a valley, and the Pope uses his Void magic on the dragon and its army; it usually functions as a Recovery spell, but has a damaging effect against entities of evil. Tiffa uses her Memory spell to stop the dragon's army.

        "Everyone regroups in Gallia's royal palace to assess the situation: while the Ancient Dragon has stopped moving, but is not dead, and now with only two Void mages the chances of defeating it is low. Old Osmond is called in to see if the dragon can be stopped, and he states that they may have a chance if all the nations band together, to which Henrietta, Tabitha, and Julio agree to. Saito awakens and, despite being depressed about losing Derflinger, resolves to keep fighting, causing Louise to fear for his safety. Saito remembers the fighter jet in Luctiana's oasis, but since it is run down, he and Louise decide to use her World Door spell to travel to Saito's world (Japan) and acquire a new one for the upcoming battle. Using Saito's Lifdrasir powers, Louise opens a door to Japan, but when Saito steps through, Louise openly states she loves him for the first time and lets go of his hand till the 'door' closes, forcing him to stay in the safety of his own world. Louise's friends watching this happen cry about her hard decision. Everyone begins to mobilize, and Osmond informs Louise and Tiffa that while the power of the Void can defeat the Ancient Dragon, it consuming a Void user will empower it, thus the two girls will be the dragon's next target. Osmond mentions that the battle will be held at the Magic Academy since it has been evacuated, but upon arriving find out no one has left. All of Louise\u2019s friends, including Siesta, Luctiana, Arie, and even the Gensou Siblings assure her they will fight together to save their world. Back in Japan, Saito tries to return to Hakelginia by visiting the spot from where he was summoned, but to no avail. The Ancient Dragon awakens, assuming a new form with wings and takes flight, obliterating the fleet that was monitoring it, and makes its way towards the Magic Academy, Tiffania, and Louise.",

The event is honoring Dorothy O\u2019Sullivan\u2019s philanthropic work with the school, but everything starts to go wrong.

That is, until Trent messes up and instead of being the supportive shoulder for Sam to lean on, he reverts back to his vice.

        "Saito lets Louise know that he will be departing in three days, at the upcoming solar eclipse, in order to return home to Japan, but when she hears this she brushes it off as if she doesn't care, which angers Saito. He waits for Louise to return from her meeting, where the war between Albion and Tristain is declared inevitable. Princess Henrietta assembles a military force that conscripts the boys from the academy. Louise walks into a sleeping Saito whereupon she says goodbye. The next morning, Saito wakes to find a letter in which Louise has written, \"You're fired! Just go wherever you want!\" Louise decides to join the princess in war. The next day, Saito gets on his Zero fighter plane while Henrietta advances with the Tristain military to intercept the invading Albion force. But instead of flying straight to the eclipse, Saito helps shoot down Albion's dragon squadrons, who are unable to keep up with the plane's speed. Saito runs out of ammo and is attacked by Wardes on a wind dragon. Tabitha, Kirche, and Louise help Saito. Louise jumps from Sylphid to Saito's plane, guided by Tabitha's magic. Swept by her feeling towards Saito being harmed, Louise and Saito finally made a connection. Louise unlocks her Void magic for the first time and casts a powerful spell known as 'Explosion' which destroys the entirety of Albion's aerial attack force including Wardes. Fouquet escaped and doesn't come back. After the battle, with the solar eclipse past and the Zero Fighter nearly destroyed, Saito and Louise sit by the plane's wreckage where they have an argument once again about Saito's firing. They end up kissing, and renew the contract between them according to Louise. Cromwell tries to hypnotize Kirche and Tabitha with the Ring of Andavari, but Guiche saves the girls with a lucky hit. Later, they are all given medals by the princess, and Tabitha gets the ring back from Cromwell who stole it from the Water Spirit. Louise was so excited to show Saito her medal only to find him with Siesta chatting. Louise punishes Saito, using her newly fashioned explosion spell.",
        "Saito lets Louise know that he will be departing in three days, at the upcoming solar eclipse, in order to return home to Japan, but when she hears this she brushes it off as if she doesn't care, which angers Saito. He waits for Louise to return from her meeting, where the war between Albion and Tristain is declared inevitable. Princess Henrietta assembles a military force that conscripts the boys from the academy. Louise walks into a sleeping Saito whereupon she says goodbye. The next morning, Saito wakes to find a letter in which Louise has written, \"You're fired! Just go wherever you want!\" Louise decides to join the princess in war. The next day, Saito gets on his Zero fighter plane while Henrietta advances with the Tristain military to intercept the invading Albion force. But instead of flying straight to the eclipse, Saito helps shoot down Albion's dragon squadrons, who are unable to keep up with the plane's speed. Saito runs out of ammo and is attacked by Wardes on a wind dragon. Tabitha, Kirche, and Louise help Saito. Louise jumps from Sylphid to Saito's plane, guided by Tabitha's magic. Swept by her feeling towards Saito being harmed, Louise and Saito finally made a connection. Louise unlocks her Void magic for the first time and casts a powerful spell known as 'Explosion' which destroys the entirety of Albion's aerial attack force including Wardes. Fouquet escaped and doesn't come back. After the battle, with the solar eclipse past and the Zero Fighter nearly destroyed, Saito and Louise sit by the plane's wreckage where they have an argument once again about Saito's firing. They end up kissing, and renew the contract between them according to Louise. Cromwell tries to hypnotize Kirche and Tabitha with the Ring of Andavari, but Guiche saves the girls with a lucky hit. Later, they are all given medals by the princess, and Tabitha gets the ring back from Cromwell who stole it from the Water Spirit.

Although elves are shunned by human society, Tiffania explains that she is in fact a half-elf: Her mother was an elf who died years earlier, and her father was the Archduke of Albion. Henrietta shows compassion for Tiffania. They discuss Sheffield's comment about other Void mages. Henrietta offers to knight Saito again and he accepts. Siesta then announces she is Saito's maid by order of the Queen, much to Louise's frustration.

        "Saito and company take refugee in the Charming Fairy Inn while the search for them continues. A plan is created to use the Ostland to fly towards Germinia as a decoy, while everybody else goes across the Gallia border directly. Scarron provides disguises for them, while Colbert, Seista, Gimili, and Reynard proceed to liberate the Ostland. Siesta shows doubts at first of not having any powers but is encouraged by Saito that she could still help. She hugs him so Louise kicks him in the groin from behind. In Gallia, Joseph and Sheffield uncover a massive object, which Joseph calls Jormungand, covered with pulsing veins with a single large eye. Posing as a traveling circus, Saito and company cross the border, while Louise broods over no longer being an aristocrat, realising she only has Saito left. Back at the castle, using Siesta as a distraction, Gimili and Reynard take out two guards and they board the Ostland, after dispatching two more groups of guards. Colbert quickly fires up the Ostland, eventually ripping it free of the chains. Agnes falls for the ploy, ordering guards to watch the Germinia border. Louise sprains her ankle, and Saito tells her to rely on him, carrying her on his back. She wonders how Saito can be so strong, despite being alone in this world. The Ostland is eventually stopped by Tristan dragon knights, and Agnes nearly kills Colbert upon seeing him. Meanwhile, Saito and the gang arrive in Gallia."

        "Using her talents at persuasion, Kirche discovers that Tabitha is being held in Al Hambra. Upon arriving there, the gang decide upon a plan of attack. Under the pretext of having a show, they plan to make the soldiers drink alcohol laced with sleeping potion. When Kirche doesn't assign anything to Louise, she gets angry and demands to be given something to do. Kirche reveals that she knows the Louise is a Void mage, and apologises for her past behavior, and invites her over to Germania. Later on, Derflinger advises Saito to say something to her, saying that Void magic is dependent on emotional strength. Saito decides to do so, and finds her posing in front of a mirror in a dancing costume. Louise begins to tempt Saito, and Saito pushes her onto the bed, but they are interrupted by Guiche. In Tristan, Agnes frees Colbert. She says that she cannot forgive him for burning her village, but has a chance to end the cycle of hatred that would erupt should she kill Colbert. Back in Al Hambra, the Baron wants Louise to attend to him personally, and she agrees, planning to drug his wine, but discovers that the sleeping potion has slipped out of her bra. Saito and Tiffa discovers the bottle and go to rescue Louise, Tiffa using her Memory spell to wipe the Baron's memories. Having drugged all the soldiers, they encounter Bidashal Vitartial an Elf, who easily defeats their attacks using Counter. Derflinger tells Louise to cast Dispel on him, which she does, allowing Saito to break through Bidashal's Counter. Tiffa stops Saito from killing Bidashal, who tells them where Tabitha is and lets them go, and warns them that Joseph is a cold-blooded man, and that it wouldn't end there. Tabitha is awakened by Illococoo, and cries upon seeing the gang, as Sheffield spies on them using her butterfly.",
