        "Architecturally, the Castellania is one of the most striking buildings in Merchants Street in Valletta. The present building is the result of a reconstruction, started in 1748 by Grand Master Emanuel Pinto, a fact ostentatiously evidenced by the eighteen crescents (sixteen around the doorway and two on the door) symbolically shown on the ornate central element of the fa\u00e7ade, the crescent being a heraldic component of that Portuguese Grand Master\u2019s coat-of-arms. The Castellania served to house the Civil and Criminal Tribunals of the Order and also provided accommodation for the Castellano. Since 1895 this building has housed the Medical and Public Health Head Office. The obverse of the coins shows the Emblem of Malta with the year of issue 2009. The reverse depicts the Castellania. The 'Europa Star', which is the official logo of the programme, is also shown on the reverse side of the coins.",

        "The battle between Neeba and the shadow of Gilgamesh ensues in the throne room. However, Neeba is defeated as soon as Jil and the other arrive too late. Jil is unable to take down this malicious shadow, being kicked around repeatedly. Henaro, somehow having control over Mite the Fool, retaliates and takes action on the shadow, but this damages her to the point of deactivation. Jil unties Kaaya from the wall where she was hanged. The decision battle begins as Jil charges at the shadow of Gilgamesh with full force. Just as the shadow of Gilgamesh prepares to kill Jil, Uragon stabs him through the chest, allowing Jil to finish him off. After Succubus encourages Neeba to his feet, he shoots Henaro and obtains the blue crystal rod, which then reveals the true form of the Tower of Druaga as Neeba slowly begins to transform.",
