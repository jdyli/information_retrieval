        "After getting the first Magic Jewel for the Jewel Box, Chiari and her friends decides to work for the cafe full time. But there are a lot of questions the group were wondering about how the Magic Jewel appeared out of nowhere. Sapphie herself explained that the bond between the Jewelpet and a human is the reason why a Magic Jewel appeared and it maybe a key on filling the Jewel Box. As they know what to do, they all decided to store the Jewel Box in a safer place and found a stand lurking around and place the Jewel Box on top and starts to shine, transforming the worn-down into a brightly-decorated place. All of them were amazed and decided to work hard for the cafe. After a long day, Chiari and her friends were going back to their dormitory while the Pets stayed back at the cafe, thinking on what to write on what is meant being happy. Lady Jewelina then visited the cafe and greeted the six pets, also telling Ruby what is happiness and congratulating them on finding the first magic jewel. The next day, rumors about the Jewelpet Cafe spread all around the Jewel Academy as Chiari and her friends knew Ruby's cafe is becoming a trend and some of the students even admired Chiari on how she became cute, making her happy and excited. Back at the cafe, the pets heard from Garnet about the rumors regarding their cafe making girls cuter, just like what happened to Chiari. As they found out that Ruby is the one who spread the rumor through invitation letters and make Sanada and Chiari come closer to each other, the others are confused until Ruby used her magic and failed, making the little bamboo sprout grow. However Sapphie had another idea on how to bring them both together and invite them to a party inside the cafe. As everyone arrived and the party started, Chiari is also excited on how many customers the shop had today. For Labra, her jealousy with Rossa getting the attention made her mad as she casted her magic to make herself cuter, but then backfired as a cloud of smoke filled the entire cafe. Chiari and everyone noticed its not Ruby's fault but worse, the Magic Jewel has disappeared from all the commotion.",

Labra reflected on what she said and knew what she's doing is wrong, until Ruby appears and notified them about Angela ran away, shocking the two and knowing its Labra's fault."

But Peridot herself is actually in trouble about her life these days as they decided to help her. As Nene closed the call, both girls were worried on what would happen next. Back at Peridot's place, Peridot is being comforted by Ruby and friends as she explained to them the reason on being a fortune teller: to collect Magic Gems. But Ruby knows the only way is to join hears with their humans friends and Peridot thinks differently on how they were obtained. Peridot however is in deep trouble regarding her job, her rent to the place and everything else. Chiari and the others decides to help Peridot on her Fortune Telling job and to get her and Ayame out of their tight spot.",
        "One morning, Ruby is excitedly waking Chiari up due to no school today and her wanting to play with her. Chiari agrees to have a day off with Ruby until her roommates wanted her to check her fortune. After then, the two were now strolling around the campus talking about her bad luck and how she must be prepared for what's gonna happen. Ruby suggested to consult Peridot, one of her close friends, about her fortune to see if she will have good luck today. Both of them made it to the park and go look for her, until Chiari spotted Labra, Angela and Rossa in the park. They also wanted to have their fortunes read by Peridot too while explaining that her fortunes were sometimes wrong. As they arrived at the said place, they went in as Peridot greeted them in a scary way, frightening everyone. Peridot apologized as they introduced each other and she starts to read Chiari's fortune. However before they do, Chiari asked about the girl beside Peridot. The Papillon Jewelpet answered the girl is named Ayame, her assistant. Ayame then instantly read Chiari's fortune, saying she'll be very lucky today, but lied. Ruby was mad on this for lying but Chiari was amazed on how good and cute she is. Now Peridot decides to read Chiari's fortune for really, but changed her mind as they're closed for today. Back at the dormitory, Nene and Ruruka were preparing themselves as they were about to go out while discussing where Chiari and Ruby went. Nene decides to called Chiari through her Jewel Pod and discussed to her about reading her fortune through Peridot.

        "Chiari and her friends were all watching a detective drama one night as they were all about to go to bed. They were then got a visit from Charlotte, a bumblebee Jewelpet who guards the campus at night who checks on the girls before she left. At the other room, Marie and her friends were talking about how to get their own Magic gems and wants to be beautiful and happy. However in a twist, the red moon starts to emit some sort of aura and completely possess Marie as she left the dorm, confusing the two. At the Jewel Tower, Jewelina is aware about the Red Moon's omnimous glow and thinks it can pose a serious threat to Jewel Land. Despite that Charlotte is keeping the academy safe, she is still worried and prepares a powerful counter spell all over Jewel Land. At the Jewelpet cafe, Nobara and Mutsumi followed Marie and reached the cafe, both in suspicion about her strange behavior due to the Red Moon's influence. Marie went into the office in the Cafe and took Ruby's Magic Gem, before Jewelina cast a dispelling magic all over Jewel Land to cleanse everyone of the Red Moon's influence. Marie snaps out of her trance and noticed she's holding the Magic Gem. Nobara and Mutsumi were confused as Marie knew she never steals stuff until Charlotte appeared and caught the three red handed and mistaking them as thieves. The trio ran out of the cafe and Charlotte follows them to take them down in a long chase until the sun rises. After the chase, the four were all tired and Marie told Charlotte she has no idea what happened to her and she even didn't want to take the Magic Gem. As she introduced themselves to Charlotte, the four must find a way to get the gem back to the cafe without Ruby and her friends noticing them.",

On the other hand, Chiari and her friends were also excited at the upcoming performance and the festival with Ruby wanting to come along. As they all walk along, Nene and Ruruka told Chiari about something, that when a couple passes through the festival gate, they'll both fall in love with each other. Chiari starts blushing madly after hearing this, before they hear Sanada's band practicing from a distance as they went to the practice building. Chiari and her friends took a peek and saw them practicing hard while Ruby bounces up and down on a strange yellow fluff, wanting to see their practice. As they kept watching them, Ruby is desperate on wanting to see them as it blew their cover and suddenly running away. The boys looked at the floor to see many presents from their fans and saw some of Taira's gifts were all cute stuff, embarrassing him to the others. Chiari is agitated on how Ruby busted their cover back at the hall as the others were not that lucky to get near the boys due to being Junior High Schoolers. Everyone then shifted their focus to Flora, who she herself is looking at the boys the whole time.

Ruby also explained that she works there to deliver the cafe's daily supply of dairy, in much to their surprise that she forgot to deliver it. As she went to get the cart inside the academy, she encountered Taira who is just passing by and then helped her carry the dairy to the cafe. Fluola starts to develop some sort of crush to Taira as they both went to the cafe. She then thanked him for carrying the dairy as he left. Later on the girls discussed on how Taira helped her with the good as Fluola starts to admire him.

Ruby then came up with an idea to open a shop in the beach for them to make more profit for their shop. Later on, they opened the \"Jewelpet Seaside Cafe\" on the beach and goes to work, with each of them were hard at work cooking, preparing and serving food for the customers. Chiari and her friends made a stop to see their progress and glad they're doing fine. Teacher Azusa then appeared and gave the girls a warning not to talk to everyone. As the day goes by, the shop is bustling with customers and the pets were busy with the orders while Ruby and Chiari decide to relax at the beach and left the shop. As they all relax and play together, they then encounter an old man who runs his own shop. The two were deciding to ignore him until he offers them some pudding, but Kosuke interfered and scolded him.

At the camp, the students listened to Apels's speech regarding camp and announced an annual Table Tennis competition, something that made Mouri felt uneasy.

She said that both Humans and Jewelpets must compete together, making both Chiari and Ruby excited. The others were also excited to compete with the others as they all go and register for the competition.

In the middle of the competition, Tour, a American Shorthaired Jewelpet appeared and interrupted their conversation. Ruby asked him if he's searching on a human partner for his own Magic Gem, but generally refuses due to his desire to work alone. But Ruby knew that it wasn't the way as he left. Later that night, the girls gather in the campfire, all happy on the search despite they lost as they encounter the boys.

Inside the school cafeteria however, the aircon itself broke down while Sapphie is making some shaved ice dessert for Labra to beat the heat. Ruby however tried to use her magic to fix the entire thing but the situation became worse. Sapphie tries to lower the temperature but nothing happened as its still too hot and decided to call Jasper to repair it. In Jasper's place, he's playing his game as he received the call from Sapphie to come over to fix the aircon and accepts. He finally went to the cafeteria and arrived just in time for him to fix the air conditioner as he used his magic to bring the aircon to life. However the aircon spew out a lot of thrash, almost burring both Ruby and Garnet and the whole room became hotter. A while later, Chiari and Ruruka has just finished class for the day while discussing about Nene's vacation in Australia. They were then greeted by a panicking Ruby, telling them what happened but shifted her focus to Sanada, making Chiari blush.

As they went there, they saw the floors all scrubbed nicely but however the cleaning is still half done. Back at the cafeteria, Jasper finished fixing the aircon as he switched it on, but instead it played a lot of loud music.

Meanwhile, Chiari and her friends were going to the Rocks Cafe, while accompanying Opal. The humans were amazed to see an Alicorn before as they talked about Master's special coffee blend he's serving. However as they reached the cafe, the whole place is closed with a sign saying Master is in a long holiday. This made Opal worried as she knows something's wrong happened to Master and tries to knock the door hard. The door opens as Taira himself appeared in front of them and got totally amused on Opal. They all were in assumption why is he wearing Master's clothes as he let them all inside. He explained that Master strained his arm on grinding his special coffee beans and left town, leaving Taira in charge of the shop. Opal however was disgusted that he's wearing Master's clothes and calls him a fake, making him mad. As they discussed more, Sapphie sniffed something burning as they all rushed to the kitchen to see the pancake he's cooking got burned. Opal scolded him for not doing a good job on managing while he's gone. Chiari and the others decided to help Taira for a while in the cafe as he's happy.

Taira on the other hand is preparing and brewing his special coffee for Opal as she drink it, but she didn't like the taste. Opal was disappointed on him as she lectured him on how his coffee taste just like she remembered years ago when she and Master first met. As she gave him a few insulting words and left her table, Taira told her he can prepare a special coffee blend to impress her.

        "With one more Magic Gem to go, Ruby is very excited to see what miracle will the Jewel Box bring. The other pets were also happy and busy tending the Cafe but Chiari and Ruruka weren't while doing the rest of their Summer Homework. As Nene enters the shop, Garnet took her away in hopes to get her second Magic Gem while Labra wanders off as both Angela and Rossa wondered. At the shop, Marie and Nobara were also determined to get their own magic gem and plotted a good scheme. A while later, Garnet and Nene were together and wanting to be friends with her in hopes to get her magic gem but only ignored her. The other pets were happy and busy making children happy on the street as the boys from the dormitory passed through and Io wanted to be friends with them. The boys just greeted the pets as they left, making them sad before Marie and Nobara greeted them before everyone left, making Marie mad. Meanwhile at the Library, Chiari is still panicking on her summer assignment while finding one of the books she need as Ruby assisted her. But Chiari got mad due to Ruby distracting her focus as Ruruka told them to stop and focus. Ruby decided to use her magic to make sure they can finish their work, but backfired as the books multiplied and Chiari scolded Ruby for her mishap and Ruruka left the table. Sapphie is having a hard time with the students wanting to help with their homework as Ruruka saw a crowd and Azusa tried to calm them down. In all of the commotion, Machiko is busy with drawing her manga as Ruby and Chiari greeted her. But she only just ignored them and left the library as both girls were confused. Machiko went to a weird room as she knocked, but then forced out for no reason. A while later, both Nene and Chiari were still busy on their studies while Ruby cheering them on but got scolded. She then shifted her focus to Machiko but then ignored her. On the other hand, Marie and Nobara were still on a search to find the Jewelpet they can befriend and get a Magic Gem. Later, Machiko returned to the same room for someone to see her work, but was forced out.

Chari looked at her and spit her drink out and the pets were surprised on what she did. Ruruka however noticed that the Red Moon's powers are becoming stronger and its expression changes, surprising the others. Luckily due to the power of the Magic Gems in the Jewel Box, they were never affected by the Red Moon's magic, which makes Marie interested on the whole thing. Later on inside, Chiari is worried about her summer assignment as the other girls cheered her up. She explained that her assignment is soaked wet in crude oil earlier on and was disappointed on it. With having no choice but to redo her homework, Garnet has her own problem as well regarding Vegetable related dishes that should be served in the cafe. Sapphie decided to turn to the Vegetable Sommellier, Dian, as he knows some advice what to serve at the new cafe. As Sapphie is about to call him, they all notice he's already in the cafe as he introduced himself to the girls. He then notice their problem due to his nose and decides to help them with his magic, changing his costume and baked some carrot cake and special pound cake for the girls. As they tasted, they all like the texture and taste of the newly baked desserts as Garnet will use this opportunity to impress her customers. The other girls were amazed on the pastries Dian makes that they decided to put it on the menu. However the next day, the cafe is busy as usual and the customers were lining up as Marie and her lackeys are confused. They then noticed Dian and then give them some samples of the cakes the girls baked in the cafe, with Marie's group eying on him and knew its their chance.

Later on, Chiari, Nene and Ruruka arrived in the Jewelpet Cafe early as they got together to talk on what to do for the cafe. Labra then noticed Rossa dancing the same dance in her dreams and also telling them about her dreams. They were soon interrupted by both a girl alongside a big brown bear with her, with the girls got scared. Rossa herself were happy about her arrival as the she introduced the girls to Yanma, the brown bear and Arisa, Rossa's teacher in the Brown Bear school and Azusa's relative. The others were amused and surprised to see her as Azusa's relative though their teacher admitted it a bit. Rossa explained also that Arisa is once her teacher in the mountains and taught her things on the mountains, while admiring her bear classmate Yanma. The other pets were amused that she did all those without relying on her Jewel Pod and Chiari and the others decided to give Arisa and Yanma a tour on Jewel Town. Ruby however is forced to stay in the Cafe with Garnet and Sapphie to look after things. Later at the school's principal's office, the girls had a talk with Jewelina about giving Arisa a good tour around campus, and noticed the similarities on both Arisa and Azusa as they both explained their similarities and their goals on being teachers.

Sapphie felt sorry for her and allowed her to go with Chiari again as she left the cafe in glee, and used her magic to go to Jewel Town, and knowing this is the beginning of their troubles.",

Azusa appeared and was amused on what she heard as they then discussed about it, and everyone decides to help out for the upcoming play.

        "The Jewelpet Cafe is once again bustling with customers as Garnet is very happy in hoping to be the most popular Jewelpet. Ruby and the others were also hoping on aiming this as well until they got a customer, a Siamese Cat Jewelpet named Kaiya. Everyone were somewhat amazed on her looks as Sapphie told them that she is Jewel Land's best model due to her amazing charisma and beauty, which impresses everyone. As the pets asked her to rank their prettiness, Kaiya gave each of them low scores except for Labra. Kaiya herself decided to use her magic and give the girls a change of clothes to make them look beautiful. Ruruka herself didn't like the look but then Rossa admired her appearance as she didn't mind. Despite everyone were impressed, Nene herself is not satisfied on how Kaiya defines beauty is and decided to prove she's wrong. Later on, Kaiya hosted a beauty lesson for the girls while challenging Nene. As it begins, the girls and the pets take the first lesson about admiring themselves, on which Nene came on top. Nobara and Marie were spying on them, and also planning something to get their own Magic Gem. The second lesson begins, involving on how to walk gracefully as the girls were having a hard time and Kaiya made it easy. Nene herself watched her move until it's Chiari's turn. But when she's about to walk, she suddenly fell down the floor and she came out with a hot water geyser, making a hot spring. Kaiya converted it into a hot spring bath with her magic before they resume their lesson about dancing gracefully. The girls were having a hard time while Nene is catching up with Kaiya to the next lesson: singing beautifully in which the girls got a even harder time while Nene herself sang nicely. Next up is how to put make-up properly, in which Kaiya is inspecting each one of them. Nene got it right as she does the next lesson correctly as well. And the day passes, the girls were all having a hard time catching up with Kaiya's lessons while Nene catches up. However as the others collapsed from exhaustion, Kaiya is disappointed on each of them while Nene felt some sympathy to her friends, knowing that what Kaiya's doing is wrong.",

        "The girls and the pets in the Jewelpet Cafe attended the live interview of Takumi Asano, with them admiring his looks and skills during the event. The girls however vandalized the picture of him as Angela herself showed it to Takumi and got embarrassed to the entire crowd. After the event the girls were somehow saddened on what happened in the interview and Ruby learned to Chiari about how badly disappointed Takumi is to Angela during the interview. In the cafe however, things gets worse witn Angela being all torn out from what Takumi told her and the girls tried to cheer her up but got pushed back and out of the shop by her continuous growing wool. Later on Garnet cut off the wool on her body and used her magic to create scarfs and body warmers. Back to Takumi, he himself can't get the feeling that he wants to pet Angela as he saw the girls wearing wool scarfs as he greeted the girls. The girls greeted him back and left. In each passing day, Takumi is still haunted by his feelings for the Jewelpet, distracting him on his goal with both Kosuke and Taira worrying about him. As he does his daily jogging, he encountered both Ruby and Chiari, practicing for their cheer to Takumi. As they talked, they then encountered Takumi's rival in Chess, Afroski who is annoyed on how Ruby mispronounced his name. He also learned about Takumi's weakness towards fluffy things suspecting that it's the cause of his downfall for the upcoming competition as he left. Feeling crushed, Takumi himself left both Ruby and Chiari and continued his training, also hoping that it would erase his desire for Angela. However, he noticed he's riding her back as he got off by surprised, and Angela told him he fainted from the exhaustion and saved him. Sanada then appeared and had a conversation with the two, talking about Takumi's problems and cheering him up. Takumi, now being more motivated, asked Angela for a special favor while petting her, as this can be the key to his victory against Afroski.",

Ruruka and Nene noticed everyone's motivation and happiness as they were then greeted by Jewelina, telling them about Jewel Land's most famous Blue Bird. Just then, a strange bird came flying and crashed onto Ruby as she greeted the girls. At the cafe, the bird itself introduced herself as Rin, a Parakeet Jewelpet who is the blue bird Jewelina mentioned. Sapphie herself is getting worried on Garnet due to her behavior and the blue seaweed stuck on her teeth. Back to Rin however, Labra and Rossa asked Rin about their luck on getting their next Magic Jewel as she calculated their luck and said they're gonna be lucky. As both pets were happy, Sapphie herself is getting worried on Garnet's behavior. Later in the kitchen, Garnet is busy making Takoyaki as Sapphie asked her something about her teeth until Rin used her magic and pulled a dirty trick by materializing an octopus and spits ink out of nowhere. At the academy, Rin also used her magic to pull a prank on Chiari, embarrassing her in front of class and another to Labra, Angela and Rossa, which ruined their hard work on putting the clothes up for drying. Back at the cafe, the girls are mad and disappointed on how Rin pulled all of those pranks to them as they talked this to Jewelina. Jewelina stated that Rin caused a lot of incidents in the academy due to her pranks for no good reason, causing may ruckus as Ruruka is getting worried. Later on, Rin is wandering all around Jewel Land as she encountered Ruruka and left as Rin decided to pull another prank to her. At the dormitory, the girls are busy studying until Ruruka's Jewel Pod started to ring and saw Labra in the window and left. Nene replied to Labra with a message using Ruruka's Jewel Pod until they all encountered Rin and transformed into a mini-Ruruka using her magic and took off. Outside, Angela and Rossa were busy playing while Labra checks on her Jewel Pod until encountering Rin, disguised as Ruruka. She told her some harsh words to Labra as she got angry and is about to blame Ruruka for a crime she didn't commit.",

On the topic of Orchid's finishing moves, while Ivy is known for her infamously enlarged breasts, Orchid's are only a size smaller, meaning neither of them are capable of utilizing Orchid's more well-known finisher properly; finally, despite her experience in alchemy, Ivy would be unable to negate Orchid being able to turn her into a frog, as Soul Edge's protection does not fare well against other forms of magic."

This was similar schedule to the pre-war Meiji Shrine tournament. Owing to this, in the second tournament, from where a calendar system was used, there was no winter tournament. From the third tournament, the winter tournament came into action, giving the tournament order of winter \u2192 summer \u2192 autumn.",
