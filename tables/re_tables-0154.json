        "Tyler, labeled The Sporto Who Sucks At Sports, is a jock who often promotes his supposed athletic abilities, but in reality, is clumsy and bad at sports. In Total Drama Island, he was put on the Killer Bass, where his lack of skills became apparent in both the dodgeball challenge (where the balls he threw hit everything but the other team), and the talent show (where he tried to impress his team with yo-yo tricks, but ended up tying himself up with it instead). Though he develops a budding romance with Screaming Gopher Lindsay (which was opposed by Heather), he was eventually eliminated due to his fear of chickens costing the team the phobia challenge. However, he made a lasting impression on Lindsay, who occasionally pines for him even in Total Drama Action, which Tyler himself did not qualify for. But he did return for Total Drama World Tour and was placed on Team Chris is Really Really Really Really Hot. Lindsay has forgotten who he was in the first few episodes, but she remembered him later on. He also becomes friends with Alejandro, and forms an alliance with him later on to vote off Duncan after he witnessed both Duncan and Gwen kiss in the confessional and told Courtney about the occurrence the following episode. During this season, Tyler is far more competent in the competition than he was during the first season and serves as one of the two secondary antagonists of the season along with Courtney. He is even solely responsible for his team's first victory when he saved their lives by pulling the team's sled from a cliff which caused it to cross the finish line. A running gag is that Tyler seems to get badly hurt in every episode he appears, and this is what causes his elimination in \"The Ex-Files\" after he stepped on a mine and blew up both himself, and his team's alien. Because of this, Alejandro convinces Duncan to vote him out. He is seen at the Total Drama World Tour finale with Lindsay. He is one of the 15 original campers who does not have a cameo in Total Drama: Revenge of the Island, but in the first episode, it is shown he and Lindsay are still together.",

        "Lightning, labeled The Athletic Overachiever, is a camper in Total Drama: Revenge of the Island. Like B and Cameron, he is African-Canadian and is a minor antagonist (the main one after Scott's elimination). He is an athletic over-achiever, which means he always does more than what is asked. He also tends to speak in third person, as in saying \"Lightning never gives up!\", and has a habit of using \"Sha-\" in most words. Lightning is placed onto the Radioactive Rats and starts the season by saying that he never loses and that he will do anything to win. Lightning's endurance makes his team win the first challenge, but his annoyance and his's team failures makes him team have a losing streak over the new few episodes. This causes Lightning to call his team \"Team Losers\" and begs so he can switch teams. Lightning also begins to have a rival with Jo, since Jo is the only female member that is too hard for Lighting to beat. This causes Lightning to think that Jo is a guy. Later on the teams merge and Lightning continues to only play for himself. This method seems to work since Lightning then makes it to the Final 3 and even gets to choose who gets to compete with him in the finale. That means that Lightning and Cameron makes it to the season finale, but they both have to battle each other in an arena, to see who will get the million dollars. The fighting then starts and Lighting thinks that it will be an easy challenge since Cameron is weaker than him and that Lightning has never lost before. However, this is proven to be false since Cameron is very smart and finds a way to defeat Lightning with his advanced armour suit. Lightning then gets defeated by Cameron and loses for the first time ever (note that Lightning wins in the USA meaning that he has never lost yet). Lightning returns again for Total Drama All-Stars with white hair and is placed on the Villainous Vultures. However, even though he lost in the last season, he continues to state that he is a winner. This proves to be right since his team wins the first challenge. Lightning then continues his friendship with Jo, and also is obsessed with his muscles, stating that he is more attractive than Alejandro. Since, Lightning's team won, he is sent fore exile of Boney island to look for an invincibility statue. He fails to find the statue and when he comes back to the island on the next episode, he fails to do things right so he is eliminated by his team.

She has an encyclopedic knowledge about every other contestants' mannerisms as well as those of Chris and Chef (to the point that some see her as a stalker, though it is revealed that she gets her knowledge directly from the contestants, Izzy in particular, herself), and brings it with her when she is among the people who qualify for Total Drama World Tour, the third season of the show. She finishes the first challenge as the final member of what she would later name as Team Chris is Really Really Really Really Hot, leaving her challenge companions Cody and Heather to form what would be later known as Team Amazon. Desperate to be with her new crush, Cody, she switches places with Izzy, taking her place in Team Amazon. However, Cody's rejections (even resulting in an attempt to vote her off) due to Cody's attraction for teammate Gwen causes her to become unglued, and Cody is forced to calm her down on many occasions. Her obsession with Cody would go on many adventures, though Cody eventually warms up to her on a more platonic level. The two would make the final four together, but while winning the challenge ensuring her place in the final three, Sierra accidentally places firecrackers instead of candles in a cake to celebrate Cody's birthday; the ensuing explosion would destroy the Total Drama Jumbo Jet. A furious Chris decides to eliminate her out of spite. Even though she was eliminated, she still appeared in the next episode, because as she blew up the plane, the remaining contestants had to find their way to Hawaii on their own. Sierra still showed her love for Cody by letting him use her wheelchair (she offered to stay at the wreckage, but Cody refused that) as the chair for Cody's makeshift hot-air balloon. And, when Cody lost the tie-breaker, he fell into the water and attacked by sharks, which Sierra couldn't bear to see, so she rode into the water and attacked the sharks until they let Cody go. She is one of the 15 original campers to not have a cameo in Total Drama: Revenge of the Island, although in Episode 1, she is seen with Cody, and it is shown that her hair is slowly growing back. Sierra returns to compete again in Total Drama All-Stars and her hair is now longer. However, due to Cody not competing in this season, Sierra is very sad and lonely in this new season. This does not stop her, however from competing well in the challenges, since it is Cody who inspires her to do well in the season. She always screams \"For Cody!\" while doing something extreme and even has a picture of Cody in her phone. Later on however, Sierra stats to have an attraction with Cameron and thinks that Cameron is the new Cody. That attraction later on leads to Sierra becoming insane, causing the other team to vote her off in Episode 7.",
