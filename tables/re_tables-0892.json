Transmitters, receivers, data processors and multiplexers were housed within the Central Station. The Central Station was a 25kg box with a stowed volume of 34,800 cubic cm. In addition, on Apollos 12 to 15, a Dust Detector was mounted on the Central Station which measured the accumulation of Lunar dust."

Daryl and Andrea return to the forest to search for Sophia, and Daryl shares a childhood memory of being lost in the woods. The two then come upon a zombie hanging from a tree, where he had killed himself before transforming and ended up having his legs eaten; Daryl kills the zombie but only after Andrea agrees to answer his question concerning whether she wants to continue living or kill herself. Glenn and T-Dog arrive at the Greene home, where T-Dog's injury is treated while Glenn and Maggie talk about faith. Lori contemplates letting Carl die to end his suffering from living in the world as it now is, while Rick holds to the belief that Carl may yet live in a better future. Meanwhile, Shane and Otis fight to escape the high school, only to face more walkers at every turn.

Shane then takes the supplies from Otis and watches as the horde of walkers rips Otis apart. Shane returns alone to the Greene home with the critical medical supplies, just in time for Carl's surgery.

Maggie passes a note to Glenn asking to meet for a sexual encounter. Glenn passes it back, saying to meet in the barn's hay loft.

        "The group holds a brief funeral for Dale. Rick asks the group to stay united, despite Dale's warning that the group is \"broken\". They work together to prepare for the coming winter, by stockpiling supplies and clearing walkers from the surrounding area. However, there is still the issue of what to do with Randall. Rick ultimately decides to honor Dale's memory by sparing Randall's life and plans to drop him off somewhere far away from the farm. However, Shane frees Randall from the barn and leads him into the forest, where he breaks Randall's neck. Shane then returns to the farm and tells the rest of the group that Randall escaped. Rick, Shane, Glenn, and Daryl go into the forest to track him down. Glenn and Daryl split off from Rick and Shane and encounter Randall, who has somehow turned into a walker despite the lack of evidence of his having been bitten or scratched.

        "Shortly after Shane's death, a massive horde of walkers attacks the farm. The survivors attempt to fight off the horde but are quickly overwhelmed. Jimmy and Patricia are killed, and Andrea is inadvertently left behind. The remaining survivors are forced to scatter in the darkness, but they eventually reunite on the highway where they left supplies for Sophia. Meanwhile, Andrea is still alive and fleeing from the walkers on foot. She is about to be caught by the walkers when she is rescued by a hooded figure wielding a katana and flanked by two leashed, jawless, armless walkers. The other survivors believe Andrea is a lost cause and decide to search for a new shelter. But their cars begin to run low on gas, and they are forced to stop for the night. Confronted with the knowledge that Randall turned into a walker without being bitten, Rick finally reveals to the group what Jenner had told him at the CDC: that everybody already is infected with the virus (and eventually will turn into walkers when they die). He also admits he killed Shane. With this knowledge, the group's morale begins to plummet, but Rick announces that from now on he's in charge, the group will no longer be run as a democracy, and they will find a haven from the walkers. As the camera pulls back, a prison complex is visible nearby.",

In addition there are paint stones, beads, gaming pieces, balls and pendants. A four-plane mano is among the artifacts, but is not an item found at Danger Cave.

Troubled by this, Kyosuke comes to Kirino, who gives him his own life counselling and decides to help him search for her in a hot spring town. After they eventually manage to find her, Ruri points out that Kirino hadn't truly accepted her dating Kyosuke, forcing her to confess her true feelings that she didn't want him to have a girlfriend, which was the reason she passed off Kouki as her boyfriend.

The next oldest, Marjee, 23, is moving out of her apartment and back home with dad. She's been evicted. Her life sucks. Things aren't any better for the next oldest, Ann, who apparently is being dumped by her steady boyfriend of the last six years, Danny, who's too busy opening a new restaurant to talk to her about it. The oldest sister, Ginnie, a 31-year-old corporate attorney, has just learned that she's pregnant, is contemplating how her life will change and trying to break the news to her husband, Bob. The sisters learn that their father, Joe, a widower, has become engaged to his girlfriend, Renee, who it just so happens none of the sisters like a whole lot. So the sisters throw an engagement party for Joe and Renee. Rose shows up having just pierced her tongue and dyed her hair bright blue. Each sister's secret is then revealed one after another, which is very upsetting and results in some serious Sorelli sister bonding which is what it's all about anyway.",

        "Series finale: As the four Sorelli sisters help Joe pack for his move to the cape, they find a curious love note from Marjee's former piano teacher, Nino Rosati, to their mother, Francesca. The relationship between Bob and Ginnie continues to be difficult. Bob tells Ginnie that he is considering taking a job as a sound engineer on Jack Johnson's tour. The opening act is none other than Bob's former girlfriend, Kylie Stewart. Ginnie, who is handling details of the sale of the deli, finds herself attracted to a male colleague who is handling things for the buyer. Ann is stuck with the job of taking care of Joe who hurt his back picking up a bag of bird seed. Marjee has misgivings about Jason's suggestion that they get an apartment together. When Rose goes to Joel's dorm room to apologize for getting drunk and kissing him, she learns that Chloe has broken up with him. Joel blames Rose. -- The sisters find another note from Nino to Francesca - and a key to Nino's hotel room.

Eager to ally himself with Paddy and Mimi, Lip enlists Ian's help to find the robber responsible for the theft of a Maguire family heirloom.

Noticing Kirino falling into despair, Kyosuke resumes his life counseling duties and tries talking to Ayase, who says she wants to make up with her, but cannot accept her hobby having seen reports of crimes relating to eroge. Kyosuke asks for advice from his father, who helps him by giving the full story on those reports. Although Ayase still refuses to make up with Kirino after Kyosuke reveals the truth behind the news story, Kirino gains the courage to stand up to her and expresses her love for both her friends and eroge. When Ayase still has doubts about her hobby, Kyosuke puts on a bold act, which causes Ayase to hate him. However, Ayase realizes that her fight with Kirino is pointless in comparison and apologizes to Kirino for her harsh words. Shortly after, Kyosuke receives a text from Ayase thanking him for helping her and Kirino make up, though warns him not to do anything indecent to Kirino.",
