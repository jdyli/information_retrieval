        "Susan finds it difficult to let Julie go for a summer internship before college because she depends on her for almost everything. Wayne brutally injures Adam and goes after Katherine and holds her hostage with her gun until she tells him the whereabouts of his daughter. Meanwhile, Gabrielle and Carlos come across Ellie's money in her teddy bear and decide to hide it from her. Ellie comes to retrieve it, but gets tailed by the police.

Lynette and Tom understand how strong their marriage is when they give advice to Bob and Lee Hunter before their engagement party. Bree tries to take over the work of the party, catering it all herself when Katherine bails on her, but Orson helps her out and tells her he would keep doing so to earn her forgiveness. Bree tries to look for Katherine but Wayne takes her as a hostage while Adam comes in the nick of time to save both of them. Katherine reveals the dark secret about Dylan and shoots Wayne when he threatens to ruin her life, but is not arrested when her friends give false information as witnesses to protect her.
