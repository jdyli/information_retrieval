Eventually they leave, only to learn that they get bigger when they're in contact with water. They run wild in the city, eating all sorts of metal in their path, and get even larger when Big Nose tries to spray them with a fire hydrant. Afterward, they're big enough to begin eating the entire city, but Pinky has the solution to get them back down to size by using a hair drier to shrink them down.",

        "Speed is training for the Super Car Race on the Snack Track which is a new course that has seven curves. After a day of training Speed meets Rock Force who outmaneuvers some gangsters by driving his car on two wheels. While talking to Rock Force Speed notices that the car has a special automatic transmission. After the gangsters wreck his car Mr. Force comes to Pops Racer to have it fixed. Speed and Mr. Force get into a fight and Mr. Force reveals that he cannot use his right arm and wears a metal brace on it. Mr. Force tells how he accepted money to throw a race but won it anyhow. The gangsters then crippled his right arm to prevent him from racing and have now wrecked his car. While Pops fixes the car Speed challenges him to drive the Mach Five with its manual transmission to help 'wake up' his right arm. The next day Mr. Force wins the Snake Track race but the gangsters come forward and reveal that he cannot use his right arm. Mr. Force proceeds to punch out the gangsters and Speed grabs his arm. They then both realize that he punched out the men with his right arm; his arm has completely healed. The racing official then chastises the gangsters for lying to him.
