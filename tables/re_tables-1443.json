Upon returning home, Earl is surprised to find Robbie in such an elated state until he samples some of Robbie's leaves. Expecting to find father and son at war, Fran is puzzled when she discovers Earl and Robbie arm in arm. Suspicious of the tantalizing leaves, Fran exhibits cautious restraint and becomes increasingly concerned when her family happily decides to remain at home rather than go to work or school. Earl's lack of concern after discovering he's been fired forces Fran, who refuses to become co-dependent, to abscond from the house and leave a delirious Earl, Robbie and Charlene to hopelessly fend for themselves.

Expecting to find father and son at war, Fran is puzzled when she discovers Earl and Robbie arm in arm. Suspicious of the tantalizing leaves, Fran exhibits cautious restraint and becomes increasingly concerned when her family happily decides to remain at home rather than go to work or school. Earl's lack of concern after discovering he's been fired forces Fran, who refuses to become co-dependent, to abscond from the house and leave a delirious Earl, Robbie and Charlene to hopelessly fend for themselves. Having run out of leaves, they are forced to recognize what they've become, but Spike tests their resolve when he uncovers fresh leaves. Will they choose their lives or the mysterious plant?",

Unfortunately, most of it's either in bad taste or just downright unacceptable (like the cheerleaders poster). But when Cheyenne doesn't object, Reba can't understand why she wouldn't tell Van how she really feels. While on a visit to the gynecologist, Reba also discovers that Cheyenne and Barbra Jean are sharing the same doctor... and Brock has brought little Jake to the appointment. When Cheyenne accuses Reba of being a control freak and running Brock out of the marriage, Reba goes to therapy by herself. The therapist agrees that Reba is too controlling and suggests that she just let go of a few things; do something for herself like go to a movie. Van and Cheyenne are fighting because she's finally told him that she doesn't like the things he's added to their room. Reba goes to a movie, leaving the kids to fend for themselves for dinner. In a panic, Cheyenne calls Brock for help. Cheyenne and Brock both complain about Reba's controlling behavior, but when Cheyenne says that she thinks it's the reason her parents marriage ended, Brock gets serious for a minute and corrects her. He tells her that it was a two way street and that Reba is not entirely to blame. In fact, he likes that she always speaks her mind. When Reba returns from the movie, she and Cheyenne have a heart to heart talk and Cheyenne apologizes.",

Reba suspects that a neighbor does not want her son hanging out at Reba's house with Jake because of all the objectionable things that go on. Brock convinces Van that Cheyenne's morning sickness is mental and that she just needs to get over it - after all, Barbra Jean only had one day of queasiness and now she's fine.

        "After being named player of the week, Van begs Reba to host the pre-game dinner for the football team since his family won't even talk to him. When she finally gives in, he and Cheyenne are so excited she can't help but look forward to it... that is, until Brock and BJ arrive with the \"bible\" for team pre-game dinners. They offer to take hosting off of her hands, but Reba refuses to give in. If they have to have a perfect dinner, silly traditions and all, to win then that's what she'll give them.

It seems she was so overwhelmed looking in the baby aisle that when she went to pick up potato salad, she picked up the wrong kind. Reba solves the problem by dumping the potato salad into a serving dish and saying that no one will ever know. The dinner goes well, with Cheyenne even participating in cheers with her old squad. But Barbra Jean discovers Reba's ruse with the salad and tells the whole team. Reba takes the blame so the team isn't mad at Cheyenne. They decide all is lost and they might as well go get their butts kicked on the field. At half time the Wildcats are losing miserably. When Cheyenne finds out that Reba lied for her, she decides to take responsibility and confess to the team. Van stands up for his wife but it doesn't change the fact that Wildcats still think they're going to lose. Just then Reba saves the day again by arriving with the right potato salad. They go out and after a dramatic comeback, win the game. (Reba admits to Cheyenne that she just changed the labels and it's the same old potato salad.) Barbra Jean apologizes to Reba for telling everyone about the mistake.",

        "Cheyenne and Reba argue over whether or not Cheyenne should do laundry and grocery shopping. Cheyenne returns from \"grocery shopping\" with no bags, but an application for an apartment that she and Van found. The only problem is they don't have the money to support themselves. Cheyenne asks Reba and Brock for money and they turn her down. She then tells Van to ask his parents. After all, they must be over the whole wedding thing by now and feeling guilty on top of it. Van returns with a new truck and his parents offer for them to move in. Van and Cheyenne pack up and are ready to move to the Montgomerys' house. When they take over their first load of stuff in their new truck Van's father asks to speak with him alone. The Montgomerys make it clear that they asked Van to move in, not Cheyenne. The truck and the offer were a bribe to get him to leave his new bride. Van knows how much this will crush Cheyenne, she was so excited about living in the Montgomery's mansion, maid and all. Kyra lies to her dad when cancelling their plans. Reba asks her why she lied and Kyra says that she and her dad are very different and it's uncomfortable for them to hang out. She calls back and tells Brock that she can make it after all. Reba talks to Brock and he admits he's a little bit afraid of Kyra. Reba tells him it's time they sat down and talked, that he needs to take his daughter out on a date. Van goes to Reba for advice and she tells him that he needs to finally stand up to his father. Van and Reba go over to the Montgomerys' to confront them. Mr. Montgomery starts insulting Reba and her lack of morals for allowing her daughter to get pregnant and it finally gives Van the courage to stand up to his dad. He tells Mr. Montgomery that Reba is a better father than he ever was and hands back the keys to the truck. Brock and Kyra go out on their date and end up at a frilly tea party store where both of them are incredibly uncomfortable (it was Barbra Jean's idea). They both decide they'd rather go see a movie.

        "What Reba didn't want to hear: Kyra has forsaken her clarinet. Reba suspects there's more to the story than Kyra saying she's grown out of her old instrument. Van returns from school and announces that he's failed his history mid-term. Brock arranges for Van to retake the test so he can pass and still play football. Unfortunately, Brock's tutoring skills are a little too overbearing, so Reba takes over. She discovers that he knows the information, but was so stressed out over football, his marriage, future career and baby that he blanked on the test. Reba helps him study and calm down, but when Van goes to retake the test, he fails again. Brock once again gets him a makeup exam but after talking to Reba about finding other interests besides football, Van says he wants to be in the school play, \"The Alamo Experience\" as Scout #4, instead of playing in Friday's game. She has her new tuba partner over to the house to practice and he turns out to be a cute boy named Brian. Kyra's busy making cookies for him at the same time denying she's interested. At the end of one \"jam session\" Brian asks her if she could find out whether or not her clarinet-playing friend Melissa Burke likes him. Kyra's crushed but says she'll do it. Brock finally allows Van to try acting after Reba convinces him that he should take some of the stress out of his life. He has a great time in the play, even thinking he'll try out for the Spring musical. Brock returns from the game announcing that the Wildcats won. Van is so thrilled that the team can win without him he wants to play again because the pressure's off. Absent: Melissa Peterman as Barbra Jean",

The waitress comes back to table to say that her credit card has been declined. When Reba gets home and calls the credit card company to report her card number stolen, she finds out that someone has been on a spree, spending $4000 on a diamond tiara and $175 at a religious gift shop. Who would do such a thing? Barbra Jean of course. Reba shows up at his door spitting fire because his mistress has run up the limit on her credit card. They had decided that during the divorce they would each get one card and Brock accidentally gave BJ the one for Reba's account. BJ tries to explain that the tiara was meant to dress up her simple wedding suit and lets it slip that they're planning on saying their vows in St. Thomas at dental convention in two weeks. Reba's shocked that they were going to sneak off and wonders how Brock thinks he can get married when their divorce isn't final. He tries to explain that all she has to do is sign a form and he can marry BJ before their divorce is final. Cheyenne answers a call from the principal pretending to be Reba.

Cheyenne and Van decide it's a great opportunity to test their parenting skills and force Kyra to do a number of chores as \"punishment.\" After cleaning their room and doing their laundry Kyra decides that telling Reba is better than being under the thumb of Cheyenne and Van. Reba gets a call from a hysterical BJ who's been arrested by mall security for using Reba's stolen credit card. Reba visits her in mall jail and finds herself feeling sorry for BJ because Brock wants to get the wedding over with. Reba encourages her to ask for the wedding of her dreams. Brock stops by Reba's house and she tells him that she'll sign the form. Brock says it's not necessary since she was so nice to BJ, he decided that he'll give her the wedding of her dreams. Reba has talked her way into allowing Brock to have a wedding in town to his mistress with all their friends... he even asks her to sing. Oops. Kyra admits to skipping school and Reba says she'll let it slide this time. Cheyenne and Van are shocked at her lenience until she turns to them and asks how she should punish a big sister and brother-in-law who blackmailed Kyra to do their chores?"

        "She announces at breakfast that she has a new position as a substitute teacher at the high school. Cheyenne is mortified that her mother's going to be around, but Reba assures her that she put Brock through dental school by teaching and she's always intended to go back to it. Cheyenne won't even know she's there. Reba's first day was full of pranks and mishaps and she absolutely loved it. When she arrives home Brock is waiting. Kyra called him to say that they're turning into latchkey kids and he's concerned that Reba's not home. She assures him that it'll all work out fine. Van and Cheyenne's friends Marisa and Eric are deeply in love. They're hanging out a Reba's house and announce that they've decided to get married. After a little questioning by Reba, she discovers that part of the reason they want to get married is to have sex and the other part is because Cheyenne and Van seem to be having so much fun. Reba convinces Van and Cheyenne to clue them into the realities of married life. She then explains how unlikely it is that a marriage would last and urges them to think about it some more. When Van and Cheyenne try to explain to their friends how hard married life is, it's revealed that Cheyenne feels smothered by Van and Van wishes he'd shopped around a little more before settling down. They argue and start to question why they got married (other than the pregnancy of course). Reba is pulled out of class by the principal and told that she's being fired. Apparently Marisa's mother called the school because she walked in on Marisa and Eric about to have sex. From what they understand, Reba told them they didn't have to be married to have sex. Reba tries to explain that they came to her for advice and she counseled them not to get married, but she never said they should have sex outside of marriage. Unfortunately, having Van and Cheyenne as married pregnant teenagers in her house isn't setting a good example and Reba is fired anyway. Reba comes home, saddened by losing her job. Brock tells her that he supports her going back to teaching. Reba explains that she was fired and tells him why. She wonders if she's making it too easy for Van and Cheyenne. Brock tells her that by taking them in, she was making a very brave decision and thanks her for it. Out on the front porch, Van comes home to find Cheyenne sitting there. She asks him why he married her and he asks her the same question. They figure out that they still want to be married and repeat their own version of they vows to each other.",

Brock is happy with the idea but Reba wants Van and Cheyenne to go to the University of Houston so they stay nearby.

Spike tells him it's because they eat thornoroids. insult-spewing creatures that instantaneously add lots of muscle, strength, and bulk to someones frame. Robbie asks where he can get some but spike says he shouldn't or else. Robbie is determined to become huge and muscular. He watched as another muscular student breaks open a locker with his muscles. He opens a lunchbox inside and in the lunchbox were several dozen thornoroids. He picks one up and eats it. Then he shuts the locker and locks it.

He asks his girlfriend to go to the dance with him and she agrees. He likes his new muscles so much that he breaks the locker open and eats several more thornoroids.

Then later Robbies muscles grow to an even vaster size.

He asks his girlfriend to go to the dance with him and she agrees. He likes his new muscles so much that he breaks the locker open and eats several more thornoroids. Spike then comes and says that he has been eating them and a side effect of them is he starts growing spikes on his skin. Robbie doesn't care and he eats even more. Then later Robbies muscles grow to an even vaster size. Impressed with his new muscles Robbie gets ready for the dance. another side effect of the thornoroids is that as his muscles get bigger so does his ego and temper. Robbie tears a door apart and rips the sink out since he is mad at his sister. Robbie learns his lesson after his date rejects his aggressive behavior and tells him she liked him the way he was before."
