While they are stuck in the cave the man from the flashback goes and finds Student Council President and Vice-President. The Student Council follows him to where Ayako-san and Mamoru-kun are. The man tells them that they have to destroy these things called prisms because it eliminates the ability to use beatrice. As the Student Council members start destroying the prisms the beatrice slowly comes back. When Emelenzia-san destroys the prism that is in the flowing river, Mamoru-kun and Ayako-san are able to due away with the storm and clear out the rocks. Mamoru-kun discovers that the man from the flashbacks is none other than Misaki-san. After Ayako-san and Mamoru-kun get to Rainbow Cliff they share their memories that have come to lead up to an everlasting love and they also share a kiss. After that we see Misaki-san on the phone getting ready to get on the plane when we find out that he was talking to Johan-san.",

        "Makoto has been enlisted (thanks to Takashi) to find the missing daughter of a Yakuza boss. He has to find her in one week or pay the ultimate price. With leads on her disappearance being scarce to non-existent, Makoto's only hope lies in a mysterious person named Kazunori. A shut in whose only link to the world is through his computers and telescopes, Kazunori shows Makoto evidence that leads him to the discovery of the missing girl and her killer. Not only has he raped and accidentally murdered the yakuza boss's daughter, but he is also the serial rapist everyone was looking for. However, with this discovery Makoto begins to realize that the true killer of Rika is still at large."

        "Makoto has become quite well known around IWGP as an all around problem solver, and even has a little bit of a following! He's approached by an old classmate, Chiaki, who asks for his help in saving the life of her boyfriend, Ali. Makoto discovers that Chiaki works as a prostitute in one of the local brothels. One of Chiaki's customers got her addicted to speed, and Ali confronted him. Unbeknownst to Ali, the man he confronted was a drug pusher for some very dangerous people, and as such he has to go into hiding. Makoto manages to get the drug ring arrested, but unfortunately was unable to keep Ali from getting deported as a result. Meanwhile, Hikaru is questioning Makoto about what she is to him, and is also approached by Yamai, who tells her that he is leaving IWGP for a while.",

        "Makoto's head is in the clouds after the previous night's kiss from Kana, only to discover that she has quit the job to go work at a kindergarten. Makoto's mother begins to act bizarrely, talking to a woman who isn't there. In fact, everyone is talking to this invisible woman, and the only person who can't see her is Makoto! Makoto traces the name of the invisible woman to his mother's pyramid scheme group, and enlists Kazunori's help in tracking down information about her, as well as the whereabouts of the elusive Kana. Makoto infiltrates the money group, only to hear a moving speech by his mother. Afterwards another group member (bribed by a free meal) states that there is a rumour that the group is a cover for a yakuza group, and that the speaker (Makoto's mother) is dating one of the head bosses of the yakuza. Makoto's newfound respect for his mother (because of her speech) creeps her out, so it is hard for him to question her. Before Makoto can ask her anymore questions, one of his friends appears, beaten by one of the G Boys. Angry, Makoto confronts Takashi, demanding to know who did it. Makoto is also reunited with Kana, who reassures him that it was not his fault that she quit. An angry Hikaru watches them balefully through the window of the restaurant they met in. It is revealed that Kyoichi wants to be the new G Boys King. Makoto discovers that the tea leaves were psychedelic, and that the rumor about the group being a front for the yakuza was correct. Makoto's mother was also mistakenly kidnapped by a group of yakuza who had meant to kidnap Kana. (The picture they were given of Kana also had her in it.) She was returned safely by the chief of police.",
