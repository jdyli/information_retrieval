Guilt-ridden about invading Coby's private garage space, Rachel compounds her sin by inadvertently offering his artwork as part of an advertising campaign. Rachel is also having honesty issues with Jake, who's being vague about his reasons for quitting rugby. Things come to a head at Coby's party, when the police come to take Jake away for questioning.

Breanna denies what she said to Arnaz on the tape, but he says that he'll get her to say those words again if it kills him. Meanwhile Nicole tells Flex that she's taking Breanna to live with her in Nova Scotia, but Flex says he can work it out. Nicole then says that he has to choose between his dream career as a professional basketball player on the NBA or giving it up for Breanna. Breanna then comes in and she and Flex both try to reason with Nicole but her mind is made up. She asks Flex why should Breanna have a half-time dad when she can have a full-time mom.
