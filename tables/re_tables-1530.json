JB and Jackie talk about each other's lives. JB then invites Eli and Jackie to go on a date at Sola de Amor, the bar where he works for. Jackie agrees for the invitation. Back home, she then invites Celine to go to the bar where JB works for, but Celine ignored her. At the bar, JB and Eli talked, and finally fixed whatever grudge they have against each other. The two shared a familial embrace, and JB congratulates Eli and Jackie for their upcoming wedding. They go on sharing that they're living their dreams now: JB, as a singer by the sea, and Eli tilling in the farm. Celine contemplates on JB and Bryan, holding her wedding ring and going through JB's letters. JB tells Jackie that he understands Celine very well, and he introduces them to Amang, and Eli feels as if Amang is someone familiar. That day, Jackie, Eli and Guada set off to Manila, with Celine left behind. As the three board to the boat away from the island, Celine prepares to leave for the Kapitolyo as well. Surprisingly, JB's boat comes speeding to the shore and invites Celine for the ride. However, Celine refuses him, and goes to the Kapitolyo alone."

Although obviously hurt, Eli tries to offend Jackie in any way he can, but it seems that the joke's on him, as Jackie really tries to make an effort to be the obedient wife he wants her to be, even going as far as waking up early in the morning to prepare the breakfast and everything he will need for work. RSL faces a four month's freeze, due to an investigation of all their ships, while members of the deceased crew ask for compensation from JB. A stressed Corazon faces them instead, and hurls insults at them, only making the gap between the company and the union worse. Later, she tells JB that she feels like the entire world's against them, but she's determined to rise through it all, and show Corazon and Eli that she can survive without their help.

Also, Celine feels glad for her cousin, as she thinks that things are fine and dandy between Jackie and Eli. Later that night, Brian tells Celine that JB needs a friend right now, with all the hullabaloo at RSL, so he won't prohibit Celine from going there and lending JB a hand. In fact, JB does need a shoulder to cry on, and runs to his Mamu G for moral support. She offers him a small amount as a token of help, and assures him that he's in no way a failure.

Celine decides to do something about JB's current situation and tells Brian that she'll meet up with JB the following day. She then tells JB that she still cares for him, and will always do so.

Celine arrives together with Brian, the couple kidding around, looking happy in each other's arms. JB gets uncomfortable around Brian, and the atmosphere gets more uneasy when Celine is called to rehearse, leaving Jackie, Brian and JB alone. Soon the couple leaves, and the soon-to-be bride and groom escort them to the entrance of the church. Jackie gets wistful, and remarks that Celine and Brian look so happy together. JB responds with an assurance that they will also end up happy in the future, something Jackie is unsure of. Monique catches herself thinking of Jackie once again, and vows never to give up, as she will come back for Jackie one day. Jackie and Celine go to their favorite ice cream parlor. Celine remarks that Fidel has grown lenient on Jackie, theorizing that the previous attack on Jackie's life has something to do with it. JB looks for Jackie, irritated that he doesn't know her whereabouts. He calls her home, and is informed that Jackie's currently hanging out with Celine in the ice cream parlor they always go to. With an interesting twist of fate, Mimay and Guada go to the same ice cream parlor. Jackie notices them, elated, and introduces them to Celine. It turns out they're with Eli, who appears shortly after. An uneasy pause follows, which Eli breaks by talking to Celine, and making it clear that he wishes to talk to her only. Celine asks him to join them, which he obligingly does. JB arrives at the scene, and Jackie excuses herself immediately. With Jackie gone, Celine asks Eli if he still has feelings for his cousin. Eli, now filled with hatred for Fidel, says he has extinguished every attachment he has for Jackie, as he cannot forgive everything that her father has done to him and his family. Meanwhile, Jackie and JB arrive at the Madrigal home, and both erupt in a heated argument. JB demands to know all of Jackie's whereabouts, and prohibits her to see Celine again, as he deems her cousin is secretly setting her up with Eli.

He then demands Jackie to look him straight in the eye, and tell him she's not in love with Eli anymore. Jackie responds with an angry stare, and tells him that she doesn't have feelings for Eli anymore. JB then storms out of Jackie's house, leaving her sobbing on the couch. Fidel stands unnoticed, witnessing JB maltreat his daughter. He retreats to his room, and reminisces good and bad memories of him and his daughter, and through it all, says that he loves his daughter very much. Meanwhile, Jackie quarantines herself in her room, and refuses to speak to anybody, even Celine, who senses it is all JB's fault. JB also secludes himself in his room, and wonders aloud how he'll make his relationship with Jackie work. He then relays his admiration to his father. JB then proceeds to go downstairs, and chances upon his mother. Corazon notices that something has gone amiss, and when JB tells her he had a fight with Fidel's daughter, Corazon orders JB to make his relationship with Jackie work. After all, their marriage is the only financial hope they have left, as Corazon has decided to finally give in to Eli's demands. Fidel tries once again to reach out to his daughter, and brings her breakfast the following day. Jackie snaps at him, and demands the reason for his sudden change of attitude. What could have been a heated argument turned into a sentimental moment for both father and daughter, as Fidel says that he only wants his daughter to be happy, even if he does not know how. Jackie responds with a surprised \"thank you\", much to the happiness of her father. The deal is finally sealed, and Eli goes to a bank to encash his shares in RSL. Before leaving, he talks with Oca, whom Gloria sees. She then warns her son to be careful, and says that there's something about Oca that prohibits her to trust him completely. At the bank, Eli encounters problems due to the large amount of money he wants to get. In the end, he is sent to Fidel, who happens to own the bank Eli is having problems with. Face to face, the two seem to gird their loins for battle. Threats were exchanged, and eventually Eli says he's going to bring Fidel down, as retribution for his foster father's demise, and the countless tragedies that Fidel has brought upon to his family. Upon making his point, Eli retreats, leaving a stunned Fidel, in the office.",

Gloria adds that they shouldn't feel awkward around them, and thanks them for taking good care of her son. Mimay accidentally brings up a fond memory of her \"ate Princess\", Eli's star-crossed lover, Jackie. Gloria felt uncomfortable, because of Fidel and Eli's constant bickering. Gloria confronts her son, and again tells him to stop craving for revenge, as it won't bring him any good. Eli sticks to his own convictions, despite his mother's pleas. As Fidel's business problems continue to escalate, he gives his daughter a heart to heart talk about living one's own life, and came to the conclusion that he wants his daughter to be free and take the reins of her own life, even if that equates breaking off her marriage with JB. A surprised Jackie asks why, and Fidel replies by saying that he only wants happiness for his daughter. He apologizes for being the source of Jackie's misery, and wishes only happiness for his unica hija."

        "JB apologizes to Corazon. Corazon still shows her hatred for Celine. Samuel approaches Corazon, who is revealed as his first and last love. Corazon despises Samuel. Tomas arrives and tries to drag Corazon away but was stopped by Samuel. Tomas meets Samuel after a long time. Flashbacks were shown when Tomas once shot Samuel's left hand with a gun after a confrontation involving Tomas' girl. Samuel says that his war with Tomas is not over yet. Back home, Tomas threatens to cut Corazon's hand for stealing his money and leaving without consent. Celine tells JB that she might not forgive Corazon but she wants him to forgive his mother. Celine says that if one day he has to choose between Celine and his mother, she understands if he chooses his mother because she is his mother. JB tells Celine that he doesn't need to choose and that he will never leave her no matter what. JB says that if there's one thing he has learned from all his journeys that is to simply follow his heart and that it's only now that he has learned to listen to his heart and that's the reason he's happy now. He says that his heart only beats for Celine. Then he reaches out to hold Celine's hand and kisses it. Gloria tells Samuel that she will no longer acquaint herself and Eli with him. Eli invites \"Amang\" for the engagement party. While Celine watches the happy couple, JB sneaks up behind her giving her quite a surprise. JB then says, \"Ikaw kasi eh. You look pretty envious of them. Next time it'll be us doing this. And don't wory, I'll save up for a big engagement party like this.\" Celine tells him that she doesn't need a big engagement party. But JB says that it doesn't matter because he just wants to show her how much she means to him and how much he loves her. JB takes a step forward and says to Celine, \"I love you Celine. I will always love you.\". After hearing JB say I love you to Celine, she just smiles, a bit uncomfortably, because she is still afraid to say I love you to JB. And then they hug.

        "JB apologizes to Corazon. Corazon still shows her hatred for Celine. Samuel approaches Corazon, who is revealed as his first and last love. Corazon despises Samuel. Tomas arrives and tries to drag Corazon away but was stopped by Samuel. Tomas meets Samuel after a long time. Flashbacks were shown when Tomas once shot Samuel's left hand with a gun after a confrontation involving Tomas' girl. Samuel says that his war with Tomas is not over yet. Back home, Tomas threatens to cut Corazon's hand for stealing his money and leaving without consent. Celine tells JB that she might not forgive Corazon but she wants him to forgive his mother. Celine says that if one day he has to choose between Celine and his mother, she understands if he chooses his mother because she is his mother. JB tells Celine that he doesn't need to choose and that he will never leave her no matter what. JB says that if there's one thing he has learned from all his journeys that is to simply follow his heart and that it's only now that he has learned to listen to his heart and that's the reason he's happy now. He says that his heart only beats for Celine. Then he reaches out to hold Celine's hand and kisses it. Gloria tells Samuel that she will no longer acquaint herself and Eli with him.

But JB says that it doesn't matter because he just wants to show her how much she means to him and how much he loves her. JB takes a step forward and says to Celine, \"I love you Celine.

He sits in a corner, cries, and was laid a hand by none other than Dadoods. Somewhere like a fountain, Dadoods talks to Eli (both of whom are spirits) about his journey. Eli tells Dadoods that he won't die yet and he will come back to life. Celine shows her concern for Jackie. Guada narrates Pong of what Atong, the man who shot Eli, had done and what happened to him. Jackie chooses to remain beside Eli. Celine tries to persuade Jackie to go home and get some rest and also comforts Jackie. Jackie says that she wants to stay with Eli so that every day she can tell him that she loves him very much. This made Celine think of JB because since they got back together she hasn't told him yet that she loves him because she is afraid. Along the hospital lobby, Celine shares coffee with JB, who had quite a hard time bringing it to her. While drinking his very hot cup of coffee, Celine finally says to JB \"JB, if I haven't said it yet, I want to say it now. I love you.\". JB smiles and then they hug. Monique arrives at the hospital, who didn't expect herself to be visiting there, as she was supposed to attend her daughter's wedding. Monique tells Jackie how Fidel felt peaceful when Eli finally consoled with him, asked forgiveness for everything he had done. After 2 weeks, Eli still lies comatose in bed. Jackie is still there, taking care of him. Jackie wishes she could at least feel Eli's presence even for just a while.",

Enraged, Corazon says she wouldn't agree to Eli's demands and remains stubborn. As she hurls expletives at her nephew, Eli says that he will reveal all of Corazon's secrets, if she wants to fight him head on. Despite everything, he says that they are still family, whether they like it or not. On his way out, JB blocks Eli's way, and insults at him as well. Eli retaliates by bluntly informing him of his resignation. A shocked JB then storms to his mother's office, telling her to give in to Eli's demands, as he will work harder to keep their company from falling apart. He adds that his marriage with Jackie will further their financial assets, which Eli overhears. Corazon storms to Gloria's house, angrily informing her sister of Eli's actions. Gloria defends her son's decision, and says that Corazon shouldn't accuse him of such things. However, Gloria talks to her son that night, and learns that he is indeed hell-bent on seeking revenge for Fidel's maltreatment of his family. Gloria reminds him that it is not right to be bitter, although it seems like her advice has fallen on deaf ears. In the Madrigal household, Fidel tries to woo his daughter for dinner, which she readily declines. Sullen, she tells him she'd rather sketch than eat or accompany him to dinner, a subtle signal for him to leave her room. Alone, Fidel is left to wonder what had happened between him and his beloved daughter, and if ever their relationship will be back to normal again.",

Gloria still thinks about Corazon's remarks against her. Eli and Gloria talk on the phone. Gloria then entasks someone to find Eli's father. Eli and Jackie share a passionate staredown at the beach. Jackie feels happy deep within when Eli said that he would rather look at the sea and to Jackie herself than swim. Jackie even mistakenly was about to go to the beach in the wrong way. When Eli told her that the way to the beach was the opposite of where she was walking into. Jackie tells Celine that she never expected the stay they had to be memorable as what she thought. Celine teases Jackie of her feelings for Eli. JB sees Celine in the market. As Celine was about to leave, JB runs to find her but fails to catch her up."

He feels bothered when he saw Celine but didn't catch her up earlier in the market. As JB stares into the sea, Celine was also shown staring in the sea as she sits in a cottage far away from him (JB). Meanwhile, Jackie wakes up and finds a pearl necklace beside her bed, thinking that Eli gave it to her. As Jackie thanks Eli, Eli says that he just bought the necklace in threesome also for Celine and Guada, leading to Jackie getting pissed off again. Jackie ignores breakfast and as she leaves, Eli tells her to take care. Jackie stopped for a moment but then ignored Eli's remark. Jackie says that she wants to go back to Manila but Celine just kept on teasing her with Eli. JB tells Amang that she will not sing for the night. When Amang asked why, JB explains that he saw his \"true love\" (Celine). Amang wants him to sing however for the next day and reminds him that he cannot hide his heart because the time will come when he would search for the girl he truly loves.
