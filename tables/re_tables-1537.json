        "Pam Nuguet is back to being harassed by \"Squid\" Connors, and his crab-lyriced love songs. Max \"Mullet\" Connors, and his wife Elena are back in town, taking up residence in the Boatshed. Laura is still reeling from Dan's leaving, so when she hears records in Dan's shed, she rushes over, but instead finds a half-naked Max and his wife Elena. Max says Dan never mentioned her, but he did offer the shed many months ago, while their relationship was still together, Laura leaving, very upset. Max shrugs her off as short. Dan is off in the Galapagos, and Jack tried to cheer her up. Angus is walking on egg-shells around Laura, after Dan's leaving. Max's and his father reunion after so many years leaves Elena decidedly under-whelmed, saying he doesn't know much about the world, and didn't know about the UN or any Journalism Awards Max won. Katrina has finalized the Community bank, and Bob puts it to the town, with everyone investing their own little nest eggs. She then leaves town, but not before kissing Bob passionately with promises of local affluence and community stature with the new bank. Max doesn't waste time stirring up trouble for our favorite shire president. Heather tries to broach the subject of her real parents with Bob, but pulls up. Laura has been a mess in court, calling recesses, sobbing in her chambers and generally holding up poor Angus. Laura develops a friendship with Elena after she becomes the court child psychologist, and Laura unwittingly pours out her sorrows over Dan, Jack and Trudy. Max starts poking his nose into the bank, and smells a rat. Turns out he has done some investigating, and the bank is a hoax. Elena tries to talk him around, but is only after a short, blunt word, from his brother that he accepts Pam doesn't want him. Bob is still panicked, with Katrina's phone disconnected, and her office building non-existent. Squid is at court, and Max finally finds out that the hysteric woman at the Boatshed the other night was in fact, \"Diver's Judge\". The \"Pocket-sized magistrate\" ordered Squid to keep clear of Pam, after an impassioned, and very much stolen, speech from Pushkin. Max meets her in her chambers after the case and admits that he omitted the fact that while Diver never mentioned her by name, he did call her \"His Judge\" all the time. Len gives Elena a gift of a lovely teapot she admired during the failed visit, claiming he was going to \"chuck it\", to which Max responds it was his mothers. Len then surprises her by recalling when the UN was formed, and that one of the drafters, won the same writing award Max did. Bob staggers home to Heather who is certain Bob knows about her parents, and blurts out she is sorry about it. Bob, who had no idea, is horrified.",

        "Pam Nuguet is back to being harassed by \"Squid\" Connors, and his crab-lyriced love songs. Max \"Mullet\" Connors, and his wife Elena are back in town, taking up residence in the Boatshed.

Max says Dan never mentioned her, but he did offer the shed many months ago, while their relationship was still together, Laura leaving, very upset. Max shrugs her off as short. Dan is off in the Galapagos, and Jack tried to cheer her up. Angus is walking on egg-shells around Laura, after Dan's leaving. Max's and his father reunion after so many years leaves Elena decidedly under-whelmed, saying he doesn't know much about the world, and didn't know about the UN or any Journalism Awards Max won. Katrina has finalized the Community bank, and Bob puts it to the town, with everyone investing their own little nest eggs. She then leaves town, but not before kissing Bob passionately with promises of local affluence and community stature with the new bank. Max doesn't waste time stirring up trouble for our favorite shire president. Heather tries to broach the subject of her real parents with Bob, but pulls up. Laura has been a mess in court, calling recesses, sobbing in her chambers and generally holding up poor Angus. Laura develops a friendship with Elena after she becomes the court child psychologist, and Laura unwittingly pours out her sorrows over Dan, Jack and Trudy.

        "Bob is cornered, and faced with disgrace, records a suicide tape and goes to jump off the bridge. Laura is sick of Jack lingering, and his offer to fix the blinds is unimpressive. Rupert tries to help with the money troubles he overhears, and asks Trevor for a share in his paper rounds, but ends up tossing most of them under his bed. The town is starting to feel the pinch of lack of money, waiting for the bank to open. Soon the whole town is running on barter and eyes begin to turn to Bob for explanations. Max meanwhile, has been still investigating, and turns out Katrina was forced to go on leave pending inquiry. Max and Constable Graham join forces, and bring the scheming redhead in to face the music and the wrath of the near-bankrupt shire. Elena invites Laura to dinner, joking she should bring Jack along, so she doesn't have to feed him. When Max is told, he flatly disapproves of dinner with \"the midget magistrate\". The Tropical Star has turned into a barter market, spades alongside poppadoms. Katrina, in jail, hugs Bob, sobbing and slyly guilt trips and hints she might drop his name to the police, unless he helps her and gets her out. A mob descends on the Jelly house, and Bob's facade is cracking. The dinner was terse, and Max tactlessly asks why Laura and Jack broke up. An empty court leaves Laura wondering if it is a public holiday. Max informs her everyone is grilling Bob on the bank. The whole town turns out for the trial, Katrina playing it for all she is worth, condemns Bob, saying he is paying her assurity. The locals decide they need to keep an eye on her, and follow her around, with Kevin losing her. Griff's radio channel is on the races, (something he has been charged with) so is no help whatsoever. Bob and Katrina meet in secret, and Katrina lies to Bob, saying she needs to go to Vanuatu, to recover the money. She asks Bob to go too, and have an affair with her, before kissing him again. At home Heather tells him his reputation don't mean a blink to her, but it does to him, and she wants to support him, and he decides not to run. He goes to Constable Graham and lets him know of Katrina's plans. Max has found that Katrina did a severe under-audit for a company owner, in exchange for insider trading information. Max says though, that if they become involved, the town may never see its money again, and it would be wiser to encourage Miss Fennecy to sell her shares, and return the towns money now, the town would make three times its original investment. Max wants to pass it off as part of Bob's original plan. When Graham questioned his choice, Max says he needs Bob on the ropes, not the canvas. Katrina is let go, Graham letting her know she should never come back. Back at the pub, everyone is celebrating, and Bob gloats to Max, who just quietly smiles. Later that night, Laura heads over to the Boatshed, to find it utterly empty, like all the buildings so far that day whenever she turns up. About to leave, she sees Max appear up the stairs, and begins to give him a dressing down about her courtroom being interfered with, when she stops short seeing Max's face. Max then quietly, calmly says Elena died an hour ago. Her brain aneurysm burst, something they had expected, just not so soon. Laura slowly makes her way back to her house, in a horrified daze. Jack meets her at the door where she begs him to hold her.",

Mabel Pearson, (Tenzin Jetsuna now, a Buddhist), an old local returns, and leaves Meredith wondering if her old friend would forgive her, and if her presence will bring out the truth about her daughter. Meredith, shockingly forgets a day, and it seems to hit a raw nerve. Max hears out and can't help but snoop. Bob, much to his dislike, has to deal with Harold as his lawyer when he sues a pest-control man for failure to eradicate Bora from five properties. Mid-way through the case, a beam falls down, nearly hitting Bob. Turns out, a decent chunk of the town was built from wood stolen from a shipwreck, from Tenzin shipping over supplies to build a temple in Pearl Bay. Max says the town really ought to repay her, by going to her lecture, and making a sizable donation. The talk of truth has people admitting their past lies, and Kevin decides it is best to tell Tenzin, when Heather can bear it no more, and tells about her birth parents, before promptly fainting. Later, when talked to by Meredith, she chuckles, saying she knew all along, but some truths are more important than others, and there was still a little Mabel left in Tenzin.

        "A heat wave grips Pearl Bay leaving everyone feeling hot and bothered. Some fireworks set off surprises everyone (least of all Max, who hides under his desk) and leads to the town hall being blown up, and a ensuing court case. Laura notices a lot of the towns men acting oddly (including Constable Graham, Griff, Kevin and Angus), and finds a small degree of amusement from it, but is mostly confused and off-balance. Desperate to escape the heat, Laura goes for a midnight swim off Max's boardwalk. The two end up engaging in a game of Marco Polo. The two nearly kiss, with Laura abruptly leaving. Kevin proposes to Phrani, who promptly turns him down, saying she wants him, but does not want to marry him, and that marriage is not for her. It turns out her previous husband tried to kill her, by Dowry Death (or Bride Burning). Phrani suggest her and Kevin begin a journey together, before physically jumping in the deep end. Idle hands get to work, with Trevor and Rupert printing off plans to build a rocket. Miranda gets hit by first love with the tattooed fire-twirler, Felix Lewinsky, despite the fact he is arrested for blowing up the hall with the fireworks he was hired to bring and set off for the town jubilee. He creates her name in flames, the two embracing on the beach. A tense family dinner with the Jellys, Meredith and Harold turns sour, Bob calling what they did as a \"tawdry little grope\", leaving Heather distressed. Another dinner leaves Max on top of Laura, although not for reasons one might think; her skirt caught on fire. Long after the flames have gone out, they still remain thus, until in the end, Laura suggest they get up.

When inspecting a place for damages, and measuring it, Craig feels even more useless, when the measurements don't match up, and stumbles across a terrible family secret; Jim Jelly was a cheat, taking all the money from the Eastern Ridge Project and was going to skip out, and leave his partner, Theo Lawrence, to face the music. They had a tussle, and struck his head, it killing him. Unable to face it, Theo has been pretending he is still alive, sending old postcards home (smudging the postmark dates), and hiding Jim behind an extra wall in his house. Hardly a wonder Theo is so guilt-ridden. Rupert's failing grades leave Laura unimpressed, and while she tries to motivate him to improve, he says he doesn't need it to become rich and successful. Laura is confronted a child case, where the defendant cares for his sister, and was caught stealing a bike. Laura decides everyone deserves a second chance, and gives the boy court funds for a bike, upon learning he needs one for a job, to help his mother with money.",
