        "The team tested this myth first applying it to actually running, then to a bicycle, and finally to a small car. For running, Kari, Tory, and Grant each ran feet (m). First they ran from a standstill, then dropping from a trapeze bar while running in air. Finally, they each rode a zipline to the starting line before running. For each of them, they were faster when running from a standstill. For the bicycle, Tory made a rig that allowed him to drop the rear wheel while spinning onto the ground. This made the bike unstable, and was slower than a dead start. Finally, Kari drove a car feet (m) from a standstill, and then the team raised the front wheels off the ground while Kari revved the engine before dropping. Once again, the car was faster when driving from a dead start. The build team theorized that traction was key; unlike with a dead start, where the runner already has traction to build up and maintain speed, hitting the ground running is the opposite, trying to gain traction while at speed, and that few moments needed to gain traction slows the runner down enough to not be faster than if the runner started from a dead start."

They then brought \"The Arrowcatcher\" Anthony Kelly onto the show and had him perform various tests. Anthony proved that he could catch tennis balls traveling at miles per hour (km/h) (breaking a world record in the process). They then had him try and catch an actual arrow, and Anthony succeeded in catching an arrow. However, at Anthony's request, the arrow had been fired below full strength (3/4 strength) and directly in front of Anthony. The MythBusters decided to redo the test by firing arrows at full strength from multiple directions. This time, Anthony had much more trouble and could only catch the arrows when he knew which direction they were coming from. Since Anthony was unable to catch the arrow in full combat conditions, the MythBusters considered the myth busted."

        "The Build Team first tested whether dry or wet sand made a more distinguishable footprint by stepping in them with an astronaut boot. It was clear that the wet footprint had more detail than the dry footprint. They then placed sand similar in composition to the soil on the Moon in a vacuum chamber and stepped on it with an astronaut boot, which made a clear print. The reason for this is that the composition of lunar soil differs from terrestrial sand, meaning it behaves differently when stepped on. Terrestrial soil is weathered and rounded, so the particles do not support each other's weight very well. Lunar soil, because it is not weathered, has a more jagged texture, so the particles \"lock\" with each other and will hold the shape of the imprint much more clearly."

After putting some fur over the gel, the results were the same, and it was noted that the arrowheads made bigger wounds in the target, which would mean faster bleeding to death for the animal. Adam pointed out that arrowheads would have been akin to caveman technology, and would be widely used. Jamie also pointed out that sharpened wooden sticks would have rotted away after so long and therefore would have not been found."

He is either to continue to search for the Rave, to help restore Elie's memory, or to go back to Garage Island to see Cattleya again. However, Haru swears that he will complete all three missions."

They parted ways after introducing themselves. The next days he was put in charge of the Knights of the Blue Sky. They are assigned to guard the possessor of the power of Etherion, which Shiba later finds out to be Resha. After finding this out, he demanded to see her in order to release her from her confinement, resulting in a debate. He then met Garein, asking to have a sword made to beat the knights, but Garein disapproved. Later that night, Resha appeared to him, and he helped her escape her custody. Shiba offered for her to run away with him, but she declined. She left, and it began to downpour heavily with rain. The Knights of the Blue Sky come to him, holding Plue and giving him the Rave. He was informed that Resha passed away. This inspired him to fight off those influenced by the Shadow Stones.

The prisoner displays flags of criminal organizations that he defeated, putting the group in shock. He then introduces himself as the Shadow Master, being the adversary of the Rave Master. The Shadow Master approaches Elie and kisses her on the lips, much to everyone's shock, espically Haru's."

Christopher tries to mediate things in his dysfunctional life (his hard-nosed, alcoholic father, his gifted, yet mentally deranged mother, and his stoner brother) and situations although he finds himself at loss for words in some situations. Christopher owns his own car shop called \"Titus: High Performance\" and has his brother Dave and friend Tommy employed there. Titus sometimes feels that Erin is in denial or disillusion when it comes to dealing with \"crazy people\" and has his own way of going about things, sometimes behind her back. Christopher is always striving to seek his father's approval but rarely gets far though it is clear that he loves both his parents despite their faults."

Despite being an alcoholic, Ken has, to quote Titus, \"never missed a car payment, never missed a house payment, never missed a day of work,\" and would make sure his kids were provided for before himself (often making himself going without for the sake of his kids if money was ever tight)."

When Perry came out of the closet, Tommy severed ties with his father, not because of his homosexuality, but because Perry lied to his mother and abandoned her without any consideration for her feelings. In \"After Mrs. Shafter\", Perry realizes he was wrong to break up with Tommy's mom and tries to reconcile with her, only to find that Titus's dad wants to date her. In the end, Perry, Mrs Shafer, and Ken enter a sort of three-way relationship, which Titus and Erin find morally abhorrent, but Tommy likes, as it means he can bond with his father again. Perry can do the affectionate things she likes, while Ken and her can have sex."

        "The MythBusters first created a small scale experiment using a model car and a set of garden hoses connected to a single fire hose. The small scale model worked perfectly, proving that the basic idea was at least possible. Before the full scale test, the duo decide to find out the pounds of thrust by using a machine, however the water pressure destroyed the machine. But during the full scale experiment, the MythBusters could not get the car to levitate. Part of the problem was because the necessary pressure to lift the weight of the car was beyond the water pressure the city's system could provide. They then got the idea to take out the car's engine block, deducing that the people who performed the stunt in the viral video may have done the same thing. Once the engine was removed, the car then levitated a full feet (m) in the air for 45 seconds."

However, one gram of sodium was not powerful enough to damage the wall (or even the bottle it was in), and 100grams of sodium was also not enough. The MythBusters then used 500grams of more-reactive potassium placed inside a cannon-like contraption to direct all the force onto the wall, but still failed to cause any damage. The MythBusters finally resorted to using C4 high explosive to demolish the wall."

For the retest, they used plastic fish cut-outs shielded by screens, so that only the flapping would be available to the sharks. There was some increase in shark activity towards the flapping fish, but not enough to be especially appreciable until the screen was removed and the sharks could see the fish. In the end, Adam and Jamie both agree that, while the sound of the fish flapping can very well get the sharks' interests up initially, it is not enough to hold that interest without additional stimuli."

        "Adam and Jamie set up a trail of black powder which burned down the line as predicted. They set up another trail from a funnel and kept the leaking funnel at the end, and the ignited trail carried up into the funnel. Later, a robot carrying a leaking barrel was set up and started to move. But when the ignited trail reached the robot, it did not follow up the falling powder and into the barrel. It was only when they increased the size of the hole and had the barrel shaking that the ignition followed into the barrel."

Haru, Elie, Plue and Sieg go to Resha's grave as their comrades face Shakuma. As the grave's late guardian used magic to hide the grave, Elie uses Etherion alongside the Rave to find it. This results in the dimension being distorted and Haru, Elie, Plue and Sieg travelling to Symphonia fifty-two years ago. As he finds no track of Elie, Sieg and Plue, Haru stops an assassination attempt to Resha provoking a time paradox; Since the assassins from Raregroove were not captured, they could kill Resha before the day Rave was created. With Resha kidnapped by the assassins, Haru goes to her rescue as Elie as acts as Resha to distract the citizens.",

Both were exposed to simulated lightning, and lightning actually struck the plastic cleats more often, although the number was too close for a definitive preference to be called (6 times vs. 4). For a second test, the dummy wearing the metal cleats was then dressed further with clothing, a necklace, and a metal-laden belt to increase the likelihood of being struck, but the plastic one was also struck during the test, although less often (8 times for the metal cleats vs. 2). As a finale, they demonstrated the danger of holding up a golf club during a thunderstorm. Lightning struck the club and went through the dummy, melting him."

        "The MythBusters first performed a small scale test with a model airplane and a small conveyor belt and were not able to get the model plane to take off from the belt, it merely fell off the front of the conveyor belt. They then tested a model remote-controlled plane on a moving length of paper. The plane moved forward from its starting position and took off. Finally they upgraded to full scale using an actual manned plane and a runway-sized tarp as a makeshift conveyor belt. Like the small scale test, the plane moved forward from its starting position and was able to take off from the conveyor belt. The MythBusters explained that this was possible because unlike cars, an airplane's means of propulsion is through its propeller or jet engine, not its wheels; a car's engine mechanically moves its wheels, which use their contact with the road and the traction it provides to generate forward movement, while the plane's wheels are free-moving and independent of the propeller, which uses air displacement for forward thrust. Therefore, the conveyor belt has no bearing on the forward momentum of the plane."

The one inch punch had half the force of Jamie's punch, and the three inch punch had two thirds the force. Anthony further demonstrated the power of the punch by using it to break only the last of three wooden boards, a feat that Jamie was unable to match. The MythBusters concluded that with the right training, a person can use the one inch punch with enough power and expertise to knock out a person."

Tory barely moved, and the pants were more likely to rip apart. After lubricating the wire, though, it became a little easier. Once the build team tried it on a real ski lift, however, the friction was too great, the pants kept bunching up, and Tory was not able to move easily. Buster had no momentum at all, and the pants eventually ripped."

Adam started first by rating 30 women and gave a rating of 96 out of a total of 300. Kari's rated photos of 30 men and had a total score of 154. Finally, Jamie had a score of 116. While buzzed (only drinking a few beers), Adam had a score of 121, Kari had 89, and Jamie had 105. While completely drunk, Adam had a score of 134, Kari had 153, and Jamie had 111. In conclusion, even though they had different results, the MythBusters decided the myth was plausible since their overall scores increased when they got completely drunk."

They found that it was possible for a human to throw a pole into the wheel and cause it to stop. They then attempted the full scale test with a moving bike. At a speed of miles per hour (km/h), the bike snapped the wooden pole without stopping. They then decided to redo the test, except with a steel pole. While the steel pole did stop the bike, it skidded instead of flipping, definitively busting the myth. The team analyzed the movie scene and discovered that explosives were used to flip the bike. They then built a mortar and used it to flip the bike in an elaborate recreation of the movie scene."

They then theorized that feet do not get burned due to three factors: the foot does not stay in contact with the coals long enough to get burned, and both the coals and the resulting ash form an insulating layer to lock in the majority of the heat. They then tried coal walking, and easily crossed them. The team noted that they felt confident because of their faith in physics. For a more complete result, the Build Team had Adam, who was not aware of the physics involved, cross the coals. When Adam tried, he had his feet burned, though this was attributed to Adam using the incorrect technique. Adam walked too fast and had hot coals stuck under his toes, meaning they stayed in contact with his skin longer than normal."

In the second stage, they tested whether an ancient arrow could be rigged to lethally explode. They found if packed right, an exploding arrow could inflict a mortal wound. They then moved to the third stage, where they actually built a hwacha to test if it could fire 200 arrows. During the test, the hwacha performed almost perfectly, firing 199 of the 200 arrows which all landed near the target army. With such conclusive results as well as historical record on their side, the Build Team declared the myth confirmed."
