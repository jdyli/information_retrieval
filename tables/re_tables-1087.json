As they both went into the Mall in Jewel Town, Ruby noticed a strange photo of Pink during her childhood as Pink takes it from her. She then showed Pink to a specialty fashion store as they were greeted by Kris and Ruby lets pink in the changing rooms to put on her new clothing for a while. Coarumi (Coal in disguise) enters the shop and buy some black Lingerie while eying on the White Rabbit's actions. As Coarumi left, Pink came out of the room with the dress being too small. Kris suggested that they should went to Topaz so they can make the clothing Pink wanted. Pink and ruby left the shop, but Pink tripped and fell into mud puddle, ruining her clothes. Back at the shop, Pink is all naked and her clothes were being dried in the sun. Ruby herself went to Topaz's shop and consulted to her about Pink's clothing problem but she said no. But after Ruby convinced her, Topaz said that the only way for her to create Pink's new clothing is to get a certain item. Will Ruby get the said item for Topaz to make Pink's clothing?"

At Garnet's house, Garnet is relaxing herself in the tub until Blue Knight brought her some bubble bath as the cat Jewelpet got embarrassed and shut off the curtains. Later on, Ruby and Pink arrived at Garnet's home as the duo greeted them for a special dinner. As Blue showcased his skills, both Pink and the Jewelpets were amazed on how much he improved.

But when the lightning destroyed part of the Chandelier's foundation, Blue acted fast and shielded his friends using a table cloth as it crashed into the table.

Just then, Ruby's Jewel Pod starts to ring and then answered the call, revealing a strange human female contacting them. The KiraDeco 5 recognized her as Professor Decorski, their boss and the one who updated the Kira Deco 5's equipment. She explained to the gang about Decoranian's big plans but got cut off. Pink and the others were now confused on what the true intention of the Decoranian and decide to go to the Jewel Mountain for more answers. But in the same time, Coal and Opal appeared and both used their Jewel Magic to create a much powerful dark cloud to hinder the group from going to the mountains while stealing their food. Ruby, Garnet and Sapphie counters it by using their Jewel Magic and making the food come to life to fight against the dark cloud. During the fight, Retsu is almost at the top of the mountains as he then found another Deco Stone, thought notices that no one is around. Back at the ground, the dark cloud lost and Retsu arrived with the Deco Stone.

She then looks around the whole town and sees that everyone is gone, especially her friends. As she is saddened that the town is deserted, she then saw Retsu coming in front of her, somehow making her disappointed. Retsu asked the Alpaca Jewelpet if anyone is around, she responded that they're not here when she woke up. With no choices left, Angela must team up with Retsu in search for the missing dezinens of Jewel Town until Ruby appears, being chased by someone until she's hit by a dark blast, turning her into a card. As the card goes to the mysterious cloaked figure, Retsu intimidated him and wanted to know his identity. The mysterious figure took off his clothing and revealed himself as a Gray Maine Coon Jewelpet named Dian, one of the members of the Four Heavenly Kings. As Retsu told him to free their friends, Dian told them the only way to free everyone is with a card game using their Jewel Pods. With one condition: Retsu must surrender Ruby's Jewel Pod containing all the Deco Stones inside. As they accepted the challenge, Dian used his Jewel Magic to create a stadium for their duel. The Duel begins as Dian makes his first turn, summoning Peridot. Retsu tries to snap her while she attacks but received an electric shock due to him not following the rules. Dian then attacks both Angela and Retsu as Dian wins.

He does the same to Ruby but her apologetic move on Opal cleverly evaded the shots, the same goes to Io as the rest of the trio arrived. With none of their tricks worked on them, Yuku decided that they should reveal themselves and make their move. But as Pink's Jewel Pod is detecting a Deco Stone, they all pointed out to the castle where the said item resides. Who will obtain the Deco Stone in the end?"

They all knew that the Yami Stone is the reason for his behavior as the rest of the stones wants the final fragment but it can't due to its high amount of corruption and will take a while. However this means its goodbye for the Kira Deco 5 as they all need to return to their world. Each of the members of the Kira Deco 5 said their goodbyes to their Jewelpet partners as they each give each other a farewell gift.

As everyone are happy, they saw the final Deco Stone now been purified, returning to the others and completely repairing the Mirror Ball. Professor Decorski revealed her true identity to everyone as Jewelina's Spirit reborn in a new body as she fuses with Jewelina's statue, transforming into Decolina. The power of the Mirror Ball also revived Coal and is now reunited with the Dark General, Opal and Io.

As the group found out he has the last Deco Stone, Angela attacked him as he spit out the last and final fragment. They all knew that the Yami Stone is the reason for his behavior as the rest of the stones wants the final fragment but it can't due to its high amount of corruption and will take a while. However this means its goodbye for the Kira Deco 5 as they all need to return to their world. Each of the members of the Kira Deco 5 said their goodbyes to their Jewelpet partners as they each give each other a farewell gift.

As everyone are happy, they saw the final Deco Stone now been purified, returning to the others and completely repairing the Mirror Ball. Professor Decorski revealed her true identity to everyone as Jewelina's Spirit reborn in a new body as she fuses with Jewelina's statue, transforming into Decolina. The power of the Mirror Ball also revived Coal and is now reunited with the Dark General, Opal and Io. The new Jewel Charm that Labra has became a new Jewelpet named Rossa and everyone danced under the mirror ball. A few months later, Pink and the other humans returned back to the human world at last.

        "Labra dies from the Dark General's blast and Coal dies as he turns into a Diamond with both parties mourning on their deaths. The Dark General however cannot accept this and decides to destroy everything on his path as he unleashed everything to destroy everyone. The Kira Deco 5 fought back against him while Kiichi is blocking his attacks and protecting the rest of the citizens. As Ruby danced on all of her might to summon the remaining deco stones, the barrier is being broken one by one until it all broke and will hit Ruby. But everyone recovered as they all fought back and luckily, the rest of the Jewelpets were revived from becoming coal statues thanks to the Deco Bus's help. The Jewelpets then used their Jewel Flash to the dark General and stunned him with pure light, then one of them fought back by force. Opal is about to be hit by one of the Dark General's fireballs as Io rushed in to save her. But Jasper then appeared, saving the pegasus unicorn before Io can do it. As Midori approached him and talked, he was then hit by the Dark General's attack, the same goes to Peridot. Everyone now begs for Ruby to dance and summon the mirror ball as she danced with all of her might, calling all the deco stones while the Kira Deco 5 distracts him. As a Deco Stone flew into the Kira Deco 5's direction, Ruby has finally earned her status as a Deco Stone Master and goes forth calling the other Deco Stones. As they all gather into one place and reformed into the Mirror Ball, dispelling the Darkness and defeating the Dark General once and for all. The light from the Mirror ball also purified the Earth and Jewel Land from the darkness. After the battle, the Earth went back to its own dimension and everything is back to normal. However, there are few more questions unanswered as the Mirror Ball is not yet complete. As both Peridot and Jasper surveyed the area, the group were questioning what is seriously going with the Mirror Ball and how will Labra be revived as the Dark General recovers from his last battle, all tied up. Sapphie summoned Professor Decorski into Jewel Land and then unmasked the Dark General, who reveals to be Decorski's ex-husband who is actually Pink's uncle. The Dark General explained everything to them about what did happened 10 years ago, saying he seriously disagree on Decorski's hobby on decorating everything with rhinestones and Decorski's hate on him wanting to be in the darkness. He also said that he wanted to shine just like his wife but then had no courage to do so and wants to create a world of darkness of despair to know his true pain.

        "The connection between Athena and the mysterious figure is revealed along with the figure's identity. Godou rushes off with Athena while the others stay behind to try to buy enough time for the Authorities Godou used up battling Ama no Murakumo to recharge. Fortunately, thanks to Godou, Erica has an ace that'll let her fight almost at the level of a Campione. If Godou can't defeat his new opponent, then Princess Alice's prediction of the world enveloped by the Starless Night (which was mistakenly attributed to Athena) will come to pass. He'll need the help of all five girls to achieve victory."
