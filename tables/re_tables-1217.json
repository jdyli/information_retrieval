        "Debra is rushed to the hospital and Quinn goes with her. At the airport, Dexter, Hannah and Harrison manage to elude Elway, but they are forced to leave the airport due to the hurricane grounding all flights. Hannah and Harrison board a bus to the Jacksonville airport, but Elway is waiting for them. Hannah subdues Elway and escapes with Harrison. Saxon goes to the hospital with the intention of killing Debra, but Dexter spots him and he is arrested by Angel. After successful surgery, Debra suffers a massive stroke from a blood clot, leaving her brain dead. Later, Dexter meets Saxon in his cell and provokes him to stab him with a pen. Dexter retaliates and kills him by puncturing his carotid artery with the pen. Angel and Quinn question Dexter about Saxon's killing and, although they suspect what really happened, conclude that Dexter acted in self-defense. Dexter returns to the hospital during the evacuation and sadly takes Debra off life support. He takes her body out to sea and drops it into the water. Once her body is gone, Dexter drives his boat into the hurricane in an apparent suicide attempt. A few days later in Argentina, Hannah reads of Dexter's death. An undetermined period of time later in Oregon, a bearded log truck driver finishes his day at work and returns to his cabin. The man sits down at his table and is revealed to be Dexter, indicating he faked his own death.",

        "Lawrence accepts Caroline's relationship with Kate. However, Celia does not; her homophobic views shock Alan, who implores her to give Kate a chance. Celia agrees to meet Kate at a dinner party hosted by Caroline. However, Celia's bigotry and hostility towards Kate ruins the evening, leading Alan to call off the wedding and driving a wedge between Caroline and Kate. Caroline and Celia have a blazing row, trading insults and expletives. Celia realises that her behaviour had made her daughter unhappy and visits Kate, apologising for her own behaviour and imploring that she give Caroline another chance. Alan meanwhile, suffers a heart-attack. Celia realises that she may have lost everything and rushes to his bedside. They reconcile and decide the wedding will go ahead. The first series ends with a flashback to sixty years ago, showing the teenage Alan asking Celia on a date. This episode shows, between the end of the episode and the closing credits, a dedication to Alec Walker (1929\u20132009) upon whom the character of Alan Buttershaw is based.",

        "Despite it being her birthday, Shinobu feels a little downhearted following a remark from her sister, Isami. Later, Alice gets irritated when people see her more as Karen's little sister as opposed to a big sister. Whilst initially having some jealousy when Shinobu shows favoritism toward's Karen's present for her, Alice comes to realise that she loves Shinobu and Karen equally. Later, as Shinobu is off sick with a cold, Aya becomes anxious when Yoko receives an alleged 'love letter' in her locker, though Yoko assures her she would've turned down any admirers anyway. The letter turns out to be a letter Shinobu wrote for Alice's parents that she wanted Alice to translate."
