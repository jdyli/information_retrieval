Ray seems to care greatly, with hidden meaning. When he tries to sabotage Lily's date with Lee Johns, Robbie and Travis are almost positive that Ray has stronger feelings about Lily than they thought. It seems he likes her more than a friend. Will everyone's love life work out or will they all realise that love really bites?"
