Finding the minifin abandoned, Winston tracks the signal from Brett's vid-phone to the Middle East, but discounts his findings as a phantom signal. Back in Egypt, Malakat begins to take an interest in the travelers he's taken in, he has Shersheba befriend Jason hoping to find out more about Neri. Jason is able to make a quick phone call to ORCA and tells Cass where they are. From an analysis of the material in Neri's clothes, Malakat determines that she is not from Earth and when Shelby and Hauser enter the camp, he directs the agents to the kids. The agents contact Dianne promising to send them back to Australia, then says that Neri will have to stay behind due to problems verifying her identity.

Just as they are about to finish, Shalamorn enters the central chamber and retakes control of her pyramid. It is revealed that Malakat did not kill Shalamorn but kept her in a state of suspended animation on the Ocean Planet as he schemed to take over. Upon returning to the Ocean Planet, Shersheba discovered this and set her free. For their actions, Shalamorn exiles Malakat but pardons Shersheba since she brought the cure back to Ocean Planet and released her from Malakat's hold. In a ceremony in the underwater pyramid's central chamber, Neri is crowned Princess, and Heir to the Throne, by her mother. Neri is chosen by her mother to remain on Earth to unite their world. Jason tells Neri he is happier than Charlie that she will be staying and they kiss."
