At school Max returns Sydney's phone (He accidentally took hers and she took his in the previous episode), and then goes to N-Tek to train against robots, not only using his Strength mode, but unlocking his Flight mode. He is then called by Sydney to go on a date. While there he leaves Steel in the boy's bathroom so he may talk to Sydney alone. He tells her he really likes her, and just as they're about to kiss, A Fire Elementor and an Earth Elementor show up to capture Max. Uncle Ferrus and his mom picks him up, and Ferrus explains taking off Steel allowed his TURBO energy to be traceable. Steel catches up, and Max and him fight the Elementors, Ferrus and his mom also fighting using laser guns. Max throws Steel, allowing him to beat the Fire Elementor, but then the Elementor falls and crushes Steel. Finally Max, Ferrus and Molly (Max's mom) are knocked out, and the Earth Elementor takes Max while Steel is shown yelling Max's name. The episode ends with Miles Dredd holding Max captive in his headquarters and draining Max of his TURBO energy."

        "Miles Dredd continues to hold Max captive, and Molly, Uncle Ferrus, Steel and N-Tek must save him. Steel flies through an air vent in the enemy's headquarters to find Max. Meanwhile Uncle Ferrus tells Molly if Steel doesn't reconnect with Max in 8 hours, Max's powers will overload and Steel will shut down. Miles reveals to Max that he was behind the explosion in 1997 that killed Max's father and created a machine to absorb TURBO energy, but the explosion permanently connected the device to Miles and damaged the storing function of the invention. Max gets angry at this revelation releasing more energy, but Miles again absorbs it. The TURBO energy Miles originally absorbed from the explosion kept him alive for the 16 years until now. Finally Steel saves Max and the two fuse to escape, but Miles captures Steel and Max survives his fall 100 stories. He shuts Steel down, and hooks him up to a machine meant to kill everyone in Copper Canyons so Miles can gain more TURBO power from their devices feeding off each civilian. Soon N-Tek and Max invade the headquarters, faced with robots and Elementors. Max goes looking for Steel, runs into Miles' assistant, who transforms into a cyborg, but Max easily gets rid of him off the elevator. Max then rescues Steel, deactivating the machine and trying to fight Miles, but he just absorbs their attacks. Finally Max has an idea: he and Steel release all the TURBO energy they can, and as they fly to space with Miles, a huge explosion occurs. Molly starts to cry, but then sees Max survived. Reporters arrive at the scene and ask who the hero is, with Max and Steel replying conjointly forming the name \"Max Steel.\" Ferrus asks Molly if they knew their existence was meant to be secret, and has her continue working at THI to sort the mess. In the aftermath of the fight, Miles Dredd is seen floating in space, but his servant appears in a ship rescuing him, and they return to Earth.",

        "Max, Kirby and Sydney go to a flee market and encounter a goon harassing an elderly merchant selling Asian weaponry. As Kirby plays with a Bo staff distracting the goon, the merchant places a sword into Kirby's backpack. The goon then closes the booth and trashes the merchant's materials looking for the sword, which he is under orders to find by Mr. Naught. Naught seeks the cursed sword of Murukami, to become a force to be reckoned with. After Kirby realizes he has the sword, he tries to be rid of it only to see it won't leave his grip whatsoever, and he is possessed by the Ronin spirit in the sword. Muru-Kirby's rampage attracts Max Steel, and Max not willing to fight a friend, chases him through the city as Muru-Kirby destroys whatever gets in his way. The two then duke it out, the sword trashes the armored Steel suit, Max loses the fight, and N-TEK arrives on scene for a report. The merchant from before is found by Berto and he explains the history of the sword: in ancient Japan, a forger created a sword more powerful than anything on Earth, but cursed it to trap the wielder in the blade, Murukami the Ninja. Naught follows Muru-Kirby, captures him, but Muru-Kirby breaks out. Naught and Muru-Kirby battle on the roof of the ship, but they have damaged the craft to cause it to crash, so they move to the roof of the N-TEK aircraft.

Berto developed a TURBO Sword for Max to defeat Murukami, so Steel can fuse with the sword as Steel isn't from the Earth, so once the sword is broken Kirby will be free. The plan works and Kirby is freed, and the merchant gives him a foam staff for the whole event. Later, Dredd learns of Naught's plan and \"reminds\" both him and the goon why they should only be loyal to Dredd.",

Naught and Muru-Kirby battle on the roof of the ship, but they have damaged the craft to cause it to crash, so they move to the roof of the N-TEK aircraft. The N-TEK crew abandon ship while Max pursues Naught and Muru-Kirby, only for Muru-Kirby to put up a massive fight, until CYTRO arrives to back up Max. Berto developed a TURBO Sword for Max to defeat Murukami, so Steel can fuse with the sword as Steel isn't from the Earth, so once the sword is broken Kirby will be free. The plan works and Kirby is freed, and the merchant gives him a foam staff for the whole event. Later, Dredd learns of Naught's plan and \"reminds\" both him and the goon why they should only be loyal to Dredd."

        "Toxzon escapes from jail and seeks vengeance on Max Steel by literally wiping Copper Canyon from the map. N-TEK keeps their eyes open, especially Steel who gets some ideas from the comic book of a prison guard on superhero-ing. Steel's fascination with the comic book hero goes over board when he spends all night reading about superheroes and orders boxes of comics. When Toxzon attacks a chemical treatment plant, Steel unveils a \"new\" uniform resembling a stereotype caped hero and others reminiscent of different heroes. Toxzon and Max Steel meets in the warehouse outside the facility, but Steel's ridiculous behavior allows Toxzon a chance to escape. Steel refuses to alter the suit, much to Max's humiliation, but Berto finds out Toxzon's plan: poisoning the city's water supply. When Max and Steel find Toxzon, he is actually planning on creating acid rain strong enough to melt buildings. The heroes battle an army of Goop soldiers with CYTRO, who gives Max the counter-agent to end the acid storm. Steel fakes losing the 1-on-1 fight with Toxzon and injects the counter-agent into the villain, who ends the storm on his own. But Toxzon still manages to escape. When Max finally asks why Steel is obsessing over clich\u00e9 comic book references, Steel sees himself in the alien off-world origins of some heroes. The two reconcile, and agree to return to the primary uniform. NOTE: This episode is filled with numerous references to campy comics and cartoons from catch-phrases to sound effects.",

Initially planning to get Steel back Max realizes that the accidental deception is his only hope of a passing grade, passing with flying colors when the teacher is led to believe it's a electronic shoe warmer. The next day Extroyer learns of the Ultra-Link on display at the school and buys it, inspired by their last encounter Extroyer has created a adapter to 'unleash all of his powers at once.' Max calls in N-Tek to help stage a rescue mission and faces off against a monstrous chimeric fusion of all animal forms of Extroyer. After narrowly retrieving Steel in time Max is able to force Extroyer to surrender, escaping at the last moment by setting the adapter to self destruct. Back at school Max decides to make a honest attempt at a science project, while not looking as impressive as Steel the teacher decides to pass Max any way.",

As Ryoko turns her anger on Hibiki, who is not sure what to fight for anymore, the girl Hibiki had previously saved gives Miku the idea to, with the help of her friends, send Hibiki everyone's words of support. Upon hearing her classmates sing her school's anthem, Hibiki, along with Tsubasa and Chris who had survived, unleash the Symphogear's true potential.",

Both the U.S. and U.S.S.R. worry that the Red Chinese will extract the many military secrets he carries in his head. A top Soviet agent, Pavlov, is sent to assist Burke in locating the missing Borodin. They learn that Borodin has been smuggled into Switzerland in the carcass of a dead ox, and is being held in a state of suspended animation. Deceptions lead Burke to finally discover that Russians are actually holding Borodin for a ransom of four million dollars.",

Saya is ashamed because she's unable to work, so Lucy goes to Megumi for advice, who tells her that she will think on it. Megumi asks Lucy to cover for her the next day, and it is revealed that she is going to attend a cosplay event. Megumi tells Lucy that she became a temporary worker so that she would be able to continue to cosplay while working. She later becomes obsessed with trying to get Lucy to cosplay as Black Rose, a companion of Megumi's character, Gerbera Pink, and Lucy reluctantly agrees to think about it. Later, T\u014dko (a high school girl) comes to visit the office and gives Yutaka, Saya, and Lucy a test to see if they can do their new jobs properly. Yutaka demonstrates his surprisingly amazing memory by reciting a nurse insurance law, receiving T\u014dko's e-mail address as a reward. Saya's nervousness causes T\u014dko to become angry, and Mrs. Tanaka comes to the rescue by scolding her harshly. T\u014dko is relieved to see that Lucy is normal, until she asks Lucy her name, to which Lucy recites her entire name. T\u014dko, fed up with the newbies, complains to Taishi, who tells her that she's bothering everyone around her. She begins crying, so he hugs her and gives her money to placate her before sending her home. Saya then discovers that T\u014dko's full name is T\u014dko Ichimiya, thus making her Taishi's little sister. Taishi shares the story about how T\u014dko came to love the ward office, but it is clear that what T\u014dko adores is her brother, not the office. Afterwards, Megumi sees that Saya has a hard time saying what's on her mind, so she enlists T\u014dko's help in getting Saya to talk openly. Saya tells T\u014dko that if she continues to abuse her brother, he will never understand her true feelings, causing T\u014dko to cry again. Taishi tells her not to come back because she keeps bothering others, but Saya saves her by asking her to come back to help her learn more, though this causes Saya to lose even more time for working.",

Saya's nervousness causes T\u014dko to become angry, and Mrs. Tanaka comes to the rescue by scolding her harshly. T\u014dko is relieved to see that Lucy is normal, until she asks Lucy her name, to which Lucy recites her entire name. T\u014dko, fed up with the newbies, complains to Taishi, who tells her that she's bothering everyone around her. She begins crying, so he hugs her and gives her money to placate her before sending her home. Saya then discovers that T\u014dko's full name is T\u014dko Ichimiya, thus making her Taishi's little sister.

Afterwards, Megumi sees that Saya has a hard time saying what's on her mind, so she enlists T\u014dko's help in getting Saya to talk openly. Saya tells T\u014dko that if she continues to abuse her brother, he will never understand her true feelings, causing T\u014dko to cry again. Taishi tells her not to come back because she keeps bothering others, but Saya saves her by asking her to come back to help her learn more, though this causes Saya to lose even more time for working.",
        "Lucy sees Saya hiding under her desk and discovers that she was trying to stay out of Mrs. Tanaka's sight to avoid listening to more stories, but consequently, as Yutaka points out, she can't do her work. Saya is ashamed because she's unable to work, so Lucy goes to Megumi for advice, who tells her that she will think on it. Megumi asks Lucy to cover for her the next day, and it is revealed that she is going to attend a cosplay event. Megumi tells Lucy that she became a temporary worker so that she would be able to continue to cosplay while working. She later becomes obsessed with trying to get Lucy to cosplay as Black Rose, a companion of Megumi's character, Gerbera Pink, and Lucy reluctantly agrees to think about it.

        "Megumi took three days off to finish all of her costume projects, including the dress Lucy is to wear during her date with Yutaka. Megumi warned Taishi not to text her, call her, or come to her apartment, but he goes to her apartment on the third day to check her out anyway, and as a result he weaseled out of that shopping trip he promised Toko, much to her disdain. He finds the door to her apartment unlocked, and, as he entered, sees her on the floor, flat, but all work completed. He later helped clean her apartment, make food, and become her pillow for the rest of the night. The next day, before her date, Megumi instructs Lucy to watch Yutaka and find out what kind of person he really is, to see if he is a decent guy or not. Lucy was shocked to find out that the dress she is to wear was too short, but Megumi insists it's okay. But she is so embarrassed with the dress that she even thinks of postponing it. In fact, on the day of her date with Yutaka, Lucy did arrive around two hours late. During the date Lucy did observe that he paid attention to her, even being protective of her. She even got freaked out by Yutaka's in-date behavior that she ran like mad and tripped. As Yutaka tended to the scratch on her knee, she confronted Lucy about her problem that is her long, ridiculous name. He also asked her as to how she thinks of him. Lucy, nervous, is unable to give an answer, until Yutaka got a call about his sister Kaoru's marriage meeting, and he was requested to come, ending the date early; but Lucy says they can do it again some time. Megumi is lurking in the shadows ready to intervene if something goes wrong, while trying to tell Toko, who is with her, about her relationship with her brother. There she finds out that Toko doesn't mind if her brother has a girlfriend. The next day Yutaka does his work without slacking off, though with some mistakes. Taishi, Saya, and Megumi notices this and finds it worrisome, and, asking him, they find out the (shocking) reason: that the one who approved Lucy's name was his own father.",
