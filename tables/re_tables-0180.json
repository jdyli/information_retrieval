        "Jonah and his father are shown having a meeting with Margaret, Doug and his teacher Ms Wheatley, which Jonah threatened in English class. Jonah is told by the staff that he is being expelled and is no longer welcome at Summer Heights High, despite Jonah's father's pleas. Jonah will now be sent back to Tonga as per his father's wishes and depressingly walks to his locker to empty it out. He then decides to attend his remedial English class instead, with Jan un-aware of his expulsion. Doug eventually finds Jonah and speaks briefly to Jan about the situation before asking Jonah to come with him. Jonah doesn't respond, which forces Doug to grab him and forcibly drag him out of the classroom, causing his friends to passionately stick up for him to no avail. Three weeks later on the last day of term, it is Gumnut Cottage's story day and Jonah's friend Leon is shown finishing reading his story. Leon and his friends then notice Jonah all dressed up outside the classroom and one of them tells Jan. Jan tells him to let Jonah in the classroom on the sly. Jonah is then invited to read his story in front of the class, which he receives applause for at the end, making Jan proud. At the school gate, Doug has a quick word with Jonah and wishes him luck in Tonga. Jonah's friends suggest bullying Kieran but Jonah declines. Ms Wheatley says a quick goodbye before they walk out onto the street, where Jonah and Leon start break dancing on the road. Scenes are then shown of Jonah's last vandalism attack at the school, which he defaced Kieran and his friend's backpacks, Ms Wheatley's office door, staff member's cars, and the roof of one of the school buildings with his 'dick-tation' graffiti tag."

The children hide inside the shuttle until the monster loses interest and leaves. After waiting some time for the tide to rise, the children emerge and try to push the shuttle lose from the rocks where it is caught so that they can float it to land on the ocean currents. They almost push it free, but the sea monster returns. The children quickly hide inside the shuttle, but this time the monster is more persistent, ramming the shuttle repeatedly and eventually forcing the hatch open.

        "As children put some finishing touches on their house, Howard emerges from the forest, leading Bell, who is bowed under the weight of one of the shuttle's seats, intended for Howard's exclusive use. Luna protests that if Howard wants the seat, he should carry it himself. They declare the house almost complete, lacking only a front door, until Menori suggests a shower. Meanwhile, Kaoru works at narrowing a river with rocks to force the fish into a smaller area, but still finds them difficult to catch with his spear. While the other children collect wood to construct a shower room and leaves for shower curtains, Bell and Luna attack a pitcher plant, using logs to occupy the tentacle vines. They miss one, which catches Luna. Bell saves Luna, but berates himself for missing it. Luna tells him to have more confidence in himself. They return with the pitcher to use as a tank for the shower. That night, as Bell muses by the fire, Sharla comes to remind him of all the good things he's done for them. The next day, Kaoru and Bell find a stand of bamboo - Kaoru uses some to build a fish trap, while Bell brings some back to the house for plumbing in the shower room. Howard refuses to work, insisting on taking a day off, but the rest of the children build the shower room. Dozing on his chair, Howard loses his balance and falls forwards, dropping into the lake - chair and all. Howard blames Bell for not securing the chair properly, but Bell refuses to get a new chair. Howard retaliates by filling the shower's tank with mud, but when Bell stands up to him and calls him out on it, he winds up falling through the shower room, getting covered with the muddy water. He runs off in anger, while the children repair and restore the shower room. Later, Bell goes to find Howard, and brings him back. Howard has the first shower, and afterwards, the children have a party to celebrate the completion of \"Everyone's House\" (as newly-named by Sharla)."

They decide to go further afield the next day, but all are concerned about Kaoru's habit of doing his own thing. The following day, Bell, Luna and Chako find potatoes, while Kaoru and Sharla check the fish trap, but find it empty. Kaoru walks away to hunt on his own, but Sharla turns back to see fish swim into the trap. Kaoru arrives to dinner late, having caught a small lizard while hunting. Later that night, Luna brings Kaoru dinner as he sharpens his knife in the cleaning area, and she tells him that he doesn't have to act alone - they're stronger if they work together. The next day, Bell and Shingo plow a field to plant potatoes, Menori and Howard move the fence line, and Sharla and Chako hang fish out to dry. However, Kaoru's uneaten dinner the from the previous night attracts the giant lizard. The children retreat into the house as the lizard starts to eat their fish.

The children concoct a plan to get rid of the lizard, but in the process of carrying it out, both the lizard and Shingo fall into the lake. Luna dives in to distract the lizard from Shingo, and she suddenly hears a strange voice telling her to grab a spear floating near her. She and Kaoru - jumping from the tree - spear the lizard together and kill it. That night, as Kaoru joins the others for dinner, Luna tells them about the voice she heard.",

The planet starts red, but blue areas start spreading from each marked location. In the cold-sleep capsule, the boy suddenly opens his eyes. They all hear the voice that Luna had heard earlier - it says \"Alduram Gyet\", and when Luna places her hand on the capsule and repeats it, the capsule opens. As the child gets out and stands up, a card comes out of the cold-sleep capsule's control panel. When they take the card, the ruins start shutting down, and the door starts closing. The children escape with the alien boy just in time. The children try to open the door again and search for another door to go back inside, but are unsuccessful. Chako estimates the ruins to be five hundred to a thousand years old. They discuss what to do with the alien boy, and Luna resolves to take him back with them, despite the strain he may put on their resources. They head back, but unnoticed by them, the ruins start to emit a shiny substance from the top. Meanwhile, back at Everyone's House, Sharla finds an ID card belonging to another boy in Kaoru's clothing while cleaning. When she asks him about it, he tells her it belonged to the person he killed."

        "The next day, Howard volunteers to look after the boy - who seems to be unable to speak - in order to get out of doing more strenuous work. Luna thinks Alduram Gyet is the boy's name, but Howard, unable to pronounce it, dubs him Adam. Chako and Shingo study the card from the ruins. Howard attempts to teach Adam how to steal fruit without being caught, but while Howard is distracted, Adam fills his arms with fruit and starts throwing them around. Menori scolds him for wasting food, and Howard accidentally reveals that he was teaching Adam to steal. Adam tries to help the others in their tasks, but whatever he does to help, Menori scolds him for messing up. Later, Menori plays her violin, and Adam sits listening, enthralled. That night, the children try to teach Adam to say their names, but Adam is only interested in Menori. He tries to get her to play her violin, but Menori becomes angry at him for touching it. Menori tells Luna she has no idea what to do with children, but Luna tells her she just needs to smile. The next day, Sharla tells Luna about the exchange she had with Kaoru while the others were at the ruins. Adam helps Menori and Howard hang up fish, and reveals that he has already learned how to do it. Later, Luna teaches him that fire is hot, and he catches on almost immediately, looking to Menori for approval. Howard tries to get him to steal food again, but he's already learnt not to. That night, Adam serves dinner. The following day, the children notice the clouds are getting thicker and the weather colder. Howard, in a fit of jealousy, gives Menori's violin to Adam. She becomes furious with Adam. She realizes her mistake when Howard accidentally lets slip that he'd given Adam the violin and reveals that he was jealous, but Adam has run away. Shingo finds him crying in the cleaning area. Menori apologizes and wipes his tears, and Adam speaks her name, then his own. The two walk back to the house hand-in-hand.",

        "Shingo is able to make contact with the newly-arrived spaceship, the Orion, who reveal that they need a replacement gyrostabilizer, before the radio cuts off as the ship enters the atmosphere. Adam fears that he'll be left behind alone if they get rescued, but LUna promises to take him with them. The children run to the four sides of the island to make signal fires so that the ship can find them. Howard gets the closest one, the eastern end, and starts his fire, Adam, Chako and Shingo stay at the ruins, and the rest of them head west. While waiting to climb the rope up the cliff leading out of the Eastern Forest, Kaoru decides to investigate behind the waterfall, and finds a cave leading up to the top. They then split up to head for the north, west and south extremities of the island.

When the old man wakes, he hurriedly puts out their signal fire, telling them the people on the ship are escaped prisoners. They'd hijacked the ship and killed the rest of the crew, only to be sucked through a gravity storm, finding themselves near the planet, where they picked up Shingo's signal. The old man, named Porte, was the ship's mechanic - he sabotaged the ship as it came in to land, stealing the spare gravity control device before escaping. He also realizes he knows who the children are - their disappearance was big news throughout known space, and Howard's father had offered a large reward for their safe return.

Meanwhile, the storm clears and the three prisoners, Brindo, Zilba and Bob, emerge from the ship. They board their ship's life-raft, using Bob's cyborg arm as an outboard motor, and come to shore - on the way, Brindo kills the snake monster with a laser gun.

The children are all stunned, but Adam is especially distraught, as the ruins represented his only link to his parents. Luna suggests heading to the mainland to find the main terraforming machine, as they may also find another spaceship there, but the others, still reeling from the shock, decide it would be better to rebuild the basis of their lifestyle first, and consider bigger things afterwards. Two weeks later, everyone is still despondent and apathetic, with only Luna, Sharla, Bell and Kaoru still taking a proactive role in things. Sharla shows Luna a cargo container from the Orion that she found in the forest, and the two investigate, finding a functioning gravity control unit inside. Luna tries it out, but accidentally gets knocked out when she turns it off, which alerts Adam, who brings the rest of the children. The others criticize Luna for risking herself, but Sharla angrily tells them she did it for their sake. The gravity control unit revitalizes everyone's spirits, and they decide to build a ship to travel to the mainland."

However, a disagreement caused by lack of parts is starting to open a rift between Shingo and Porte. Since the gravity control unit they found wouldn't be powerful enough to produce both lift and propulsion for their ship, Shingo comes up with the idea of using sail power for propulsion, but Porte rejects it outright, not willing to ignore centuries of tradition in spaceship construction.

With Adam cured, they head for the main terraforming machine, and the spaceship that they now know is there."

Luna gathers her energies and those of her friends in her hand, and blasts the nanomachines out of Howard and Sharla's bodies, returning them to normal. Survive admires Luna's power, but as the children have another tearful reunion, an alert sounds, and the room starts shaking."
