Julie is a massage therapist, and when she gives Grace a free massage, Grace is concerned when she massages a little further south than usual. Grace gets Karen to hire Julie to see if that's a normal part of Julie's massage, and when she finds out that it isn't, she asks Julie about it. Julie assures Grace that it's perfectly normal for girlfriends to be physically friendly with each other, and that's all it was, friendly. Grace is reassured, but thrown off-guard when Julie surprises her again during a hug. Karen sets up Will with her newly out-of-the-closet cousin Barry. Jack tries to fight Will for the opportunity to date Barry, until he sees the man. While Karen encourages the relationship, Will tries to let Barry down easily. Jack tells Will that he should mentor Barry, and teach him how to be a proper gay man."

Barry is shot down, and Jack admits that he paid the guy that Will asked out his first time.

        "Will is dating a loser named Paul, and hasn't been able to break up with him because he likes his dog, Pepper, so much. Will is in the process of trying again to break up with Paul when Paul asks Will to take Pepper for the weekend while he's out of town. Will is excited to do so, but horrified when Pepper runs away. Will tries to use Pepper's disappearance to make Paul dump him, but instead, Paul wants Will's comfort. Paul suggests they go out of town for the weekend, and Will can't say no, but when he goes to pick up Paul he finds Pepper tucked away in the bedroom. It turns out Paul uses Pepper to get guys, and pulls this trick all the time. Pepper has doggie Lo-Jack, a tracking chip in his neck, and is trained to run away. Will is finally able to walk out on Paul. Grace meets Karen's very good-looking nephew, Sumner, and sparks immediately fly. When Grace tells Karen she's interested, Karen tells her Sumner is married. Grace finds out that Karen is lying, and asks her why. Karen tells Grace that she only told her that because Sumner takes advantage of women and uses them for their money... in fact, he went to jail for it once. Grace quickly finds out that this, too, is a lie. Grace is offended, and thinks that Karen has decided that Grace isn't good enough for Sumner. When Grace confronts her employee, Karen finally admits that she actually thinks Sumner isn't good enough for Grace.",

        "Will tries to get Grace and his boss, Ben, to get along, and they get along so well that they end up in bed together. Will decides he's not going to freak out about it. Rosario tells Jack that she wants a divorce so she can marry the gardener. Jack decides to sue Karen to keep him in the lifestyle that he's become accustomed to. Will helps Jack, but Ben tells him he can't because Karen is their client. On top of this, Will discovers Ben cheating on Grace, so he quits his job. Will realizes that Ben and Grace are actually both dating other people, and are both okay with this. He can't believe he quit his job over this. Jack loses miserably in his law suit against Karen, and so he moves in with Will.

Jack convinces Grace to be Elliot's date, and tags along himself as an escort. At the dance, it turns out that Nancy's date got sick, so Jack encourages Elliot to ask her to dance while Grace finds herself reliving her own high school days as a wallflower on the bench with the other losers. Jack tries to teach Elliot to dance, but when his favorite song comes on he pushes his son to the side and takes center stage. Elliot is embarrassed, but it turns out that he and Nancy bond over having gay parents. Karen has great fun at her lawyer Will's expense when she continues to capriciously summon him for bogus \"emergencies\" like fixing a fax machine and opening a jar of olives. However, when FBI agents start investigating Karen's husband Stanley, and Karen calls Will with this real emergency, he believes she's just crying wolf again and refuses to come to her aid. When the FBI agents come to Will's office, he mocks them, thinking they're actors hired by Karen... until he sees on the news that Stanley has been arrested.",

        "While visiting Stan in prison, Grace runs into a charming old crush from high school, Glen, who is doing 5 to 10 for real-estate fraud. Grace starts \"dating\" Glen, but is soon horrified to discover that he's two-timing her. Meanwhile, as a favor to Grace, Will has taken on Glen's appeal, and is excited to actually be litigating. When Grace breaks up with Glen and asks Will to drop the case, Will refuses, and gets Glen off, but then tells Glen to stay away from Grace. Grace ends up proud of Will's performance in court. Rosario is angry with Karen for not visiting Stan in prison enough, and can't believe it when Karen says that prison isn't that bad. Rosario bets Karen and Jack that they can't stay in her room for three days, nevermind prison, and Karen takes the bet, promising to visit Stan every day if she loses. Karen and Jack suffer together for three days, and almost win the bet, but two hours away from freedom Karen realizes that if she's had this horrible a three day stay in Rosario's room, real prison must be awful for Stan, so she loses the bet willingly and goes to visit her husband.",

        "Karen and Rosario get back to the yacht on a stolen Jet Ski, and Karen tries to weasel out of her promise to let Rosario take one Friday off of work a month because Rosario saved her life. Grace freaks out about the romantic letter to her husband from another doctor, but when Leo has to come back to the U.S. (because he left his passport in the bag that Grace had), he assures her she's the only woman he's interested in. Leo decides to give up Doctors Without Borders so he can be with Grace. Jack and Will wake up naked in bed together and aren't sure what happened.

        "Will and Grace meet a new guy in their building, Ned, and Will tries to be friendly, while Grace ignores him and is outright rude. Grace scolds Will for being nice, saying they don't want to get to know any random new people in their building. Later, Grace is in the elevator with Ned, and he mentions that he thinks she's rude. To prove that she's not, Grace invites Ned over for cocktails, and she and Will proceed to have one of the most boring nights of their lives. However, Will can't contain himself, and asks Ned over for dinner on Friday. Ned cancels dinner at the last minute, because his brother got into a car accident and he has to go to the hospital, but when Will and Grace hear music coming from Ned's apartment upstairs, they know they've been lied to. They go upstairs to confront Ned, who tells them that he heard all the terrible things they said about him while he was in the bathroom, and they hurt his feelings. Will and Grace apologize, and sincerely invite Ned over for dinner again. Ned says he's busy having tea with friends, but Will and Grace are welcome to join them. Will and Grace are slightly horrified when they come into Ned's apartment and join a tea party full of stuffed animals. Jack is feeling intimidated by his coworkers with marketing degrees and work experience, and finds himself being a yes-man and just trying to agree with everyone else's opinion on everything. He even goes so far as to throw his Cher doll in the trash when one of his coworkers scoffs at the stereotype that all gay men love Cher. Karen reminds Jack that while his coworkers may have fancy degrees and work experience, while they were stuck in school Jack was watching TV, and he knows TV. Jack is uplifted, and decides to stand up for himself, gaining the respect of his boss. His boss even suggests that Jack should do a documentary on Cher.",

However, Will can't contain himself, and asks Ned over for dinner on Friday. Ned cancels dinner at the last minute, because his brother got into a car accident and he has to go to the hospital, but when Will and Grace hear music coming from Ned's apartment upstairs, they know they've been lied to. They go upstairs to confront Ned, who tells them that he heard all the terrible things they said about him while he was in the bathroom, and they hurt his feelings. Will and Grace apologize, and sincerely invite Ned over for dinner again. Ned says he's busy having tea with friends, but Will and Grace are welcome to join them. Will and Grace are slightly horrified when they come into Ned's apartment and join a tea party full of stuffed animals. Jack is feeling intimidated by his coworkers with marketing degrees and work experience, and finds himself being a yes-man and just trying to agree with everyone else's opinion on everything. He even goes so far as to throw his Cher doll in the trash when one of his coworkers scoffs at the stereotype that all gay men love Cher. Karen reminds Jack that while his coworkers may have fancy degrees and work experience, while they were stuck in school Jack was watching TV, and he knows TV. Jack is uplifted, and decides to stand up for himself, gaining the respect of his boss. His boss even suggests that Jack should do a documentary on Cher."

Vince decides to give Will a key to his apartment for his birthday, but Grace talks him out of it, thinking it will be cheap. Will is disappointed when he gets a wallet from Vince, and the rest of his party goes to hell when Karen is depressed that it's also Stan's birthday, and she and Jack decide to celebrate Stan instead.

Grace thinks that Leo wants to meet on the roof of the Peninsula Hotel for their anniversary like they originally planned, and she can't stop thinking about it.

To get a jump on Vince's mom liking him, Will takes her out shopping, but accidentally causes her to break her toe while trying on some very high heels. To make it up to her, Will decides to cook her usual big Italian Thanksgiving dinner, even though she spends the entire time trying to put him down. Vince's sister, Ro, admits to Jack that she's a lesbian and wants to break up with her fianc\u00e9. Jack tells Ro she should come out at Thanksgiving dinner, but Will, wanting everything to be perfect, convinces her to wait. Karen and Grace, who have both been single for a while and haven't had any recent sex, find themselves fighting over Vince's hot cousin Sal\u2014who they later find out is only 16 years old. Vince constantly feels put down by his dad, even though the slights are only imagined. Finally, as dinner is served and Will is giving the toast, he can't take Vince's mom's bad-mouthing anymore, so he lets her have it, outing Ro and embarrassing Grace and Karen at the same time.

        "Will announces that he's up for partner at his firm and Vince admits that he got fired. Will's boss, Margot, has a dinner party for him and the other two partner candidates. Margot also invites Grace to dinner, saying that she has someone she wants to set up with Grace, but the someone turns out to be her own pathetic husband who just wants to be spanked. Vince goes to dinner as Will's date, but is even more depressed because he just got fired from another job as a security guard at a jewelry store. Will is torn between kissing Margot's ass to get the job as partner, and caring for his obviously depressed boyfriend. When he finally tells Margot he has to take Vince home, Margot gives him the job as partner anyway. At home, Vince says he doesn't want to be the guy that brings Will down, and they mutually decide to \"take a break,\" even though Will realizes they're probably breaking up. Rosario is sick, and ends up in the hospital after having to have her tonsils out. Karen insists that Rosario is faking it, until she thinks Rosario has died, when she admits that she just didn't want to face the idea of perhaps losing her maid/friend.",

Her father apologizes and tries to be the more serious and caring dad she wants, but can't help laughing at his daughter when she falls through a chair. Luckily, Grace is happy that her dad is at least trying to take an interest in her life instead of just her pitfalls. In the meantime, Karen entertains herself with Grace's dad's creepy friend, a dry-cleaner named Burt Wolfe. Back in the city, Jack sets up Will on a blind date\u2014with an actual blind man. When Will's date feels his face and is bummed that he always gets set up with ugly guys because he's blind, Will gets all bent out of shape, which is when Jack runs out and admits that the whole date was being filmed for OutTV's version of Punk'd, called Pinked. Jack desperately tries to get Will to sign the release so that they can air his episode of Pinked, but Will refuses, saying that he's already self-conscious enough about his looks. To get Will to sign the release, Jack admits he's self-conscious about his looks too, and shows Will that he's wearing a girdle. That's when Will tells Jack that he's now been Pinked too.",
