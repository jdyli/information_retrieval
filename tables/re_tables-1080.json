        "It has been seven years since the ultimate fight which resulted in No. 1 Blader in the World, Gingka Hagane, defeating the God of Destruction, Nemesis, and as a result, saving the world from a demise. Zyro Kurogane, an admirer of Gingka Hagane, is dashing in the streets, in a hurry, and quite worried. A Beyblade tournament is going on, with one Blader winning against the other. After that match, Zyro quickly arrives where he is ready and confident for his battle. Zyro and his competitor are ready, while Zyro reveals his Beyblade, Samurai Ifrit. They begin and yell \"3... 2... 1... Let It Rip!\". The Bladers launched their Beys in an ultimate fight. With Samurai Ifraid getting some successful hits against the opponent and with the upper hand. Soon enough, Zyro decides to end it as he commands Ifrit to jump into the air, where Samurai Ifrit is then commanded to strike downwards and hit the opponent. In the end, Zyro takes the win as he and Samurai Ifrit are proud of the victory. Which people cheering and such, Zyro decides to thank one person in all his might, Gingka. And Zyro also feels as if he is strong enough to take on anyone and with all this training. He has a flashback to the past, a moment in the past where Zyro was a young child, and Gingka gave young Zero his future Beyblade, Samurai Ifrit. Ever since then, Zyro had idolized Gingka and has wished to be just like him, and with it, he will make it. Later, at the WBBA, Tsubasa is at work where he receives an incoming transmission from his co-worker, Madoka Amano at the B-Pit. Tsubasa is now the Director of the WBBA while Madoka manages the B-Pit. Madoka tells Tsubasa some news and which Tsubasa replies. Later, Madoka is about to open the door for the B-Pit where subsequently, a group of young children in a large pack, startle and surprise Madoka. Zyro is then shown to be walking along, finding Bladers battling and training. One such Blader makes a mistake and accidentally shoots his Beyblade near Zero. The Blader apologized, but Zyro does not mind and happily gives him his Bey back. The boy thanks Zyro and tells him of a tournament that is happening close to the training site. Zyro is surprised, and dashes to the tournament. Zyro gets to the tournament, and is totally in awe. He finds that the tournament is not like normal ones, in fact, it is based on Zero-G. Beyblade has entered a new era, where BeyStadiums now move and completely change the game like never before. Mal, a fellow Beyblade mechanic much like Madoka, is watching the battle as she analyses it with her BeyComputer. Zyro takes a gander at the battle, seeing how the BeyStadium they are in, is remotely large. With Bladers standing on platforms held in the air where the BeyStadium moves in a circular motion as the Beys fight. Drastically adding more factors to the battle and making it more enjoyable and suspenseful. The battle ends, and Zyro wants to go next. Three Bladers stop Zyro and tell him that they are next in line and Zyro will have to wait. Zyro tells him that he is very eager to battle as this is his first time battling in Zero-G. The three Bladers make a compromise with Zyro and tell him he can go next as long as they fight Zyro, in a 9 vs. 1. Zyro agrees, much to their surprise and prepare for it. Everyone is ready and they all yell \"Let It Rip!\" as the Beys are launched. Every Beyblade fights fiercely as Zyro and Ifrit are ready for anything.

        "It has been seven years since the ultimate fight which resulted in No. 1 Blader in the World, Gingka Hagane, defeating the God of Destruction, Nemesis, and as a result, saving the world from a demise. Zyro Kurogane, an admirer of Gingka Hagane, is dashing in the streets, in a hurry, and quite worried. A Beyblade tournament is going on, with one Blader winning against the other. After that match, Zyro quickly arrives where he is ready and confident for his battle. Zyro and his competitor are ready, while Zyro reveals his Beyblade, Samurai Ifrit. They begin and yell \"3... 2... 1... Let It Rip!\". The Bladers launched their Beys in an ultimate fight. With Samurai Ifraid getting some successful hits against the opponent and with the upper hand. Soon enough, Zyro decides to end it as he commands Ifrit to jump into the air, where Samurai Ifrit is then commanded to strike downwards and hit the opponent. In the end, Zyro takes the win as he and Samurai Ifrit are proud of the victory. Which people cheering and such, Zyro decides to thank one person in all his might, Gingka. And Zyro also feels as if he is strong enough to take on anyone and with all this training. He has a flashback to the past, a moment in the past where Zyro was a young child, and Gingka gave young Zero his future Beyblade, Samurai Ifrit. Ever since then, Zyro had idolized Gingka and has wished to be just like him, and with it, he will make it. Later, at the WBBA, Tsubasa is at work where he receives an incoming transmission from his co-worker, Madoka Amano at the B-Pit. Tsubasa is now the Director of the WBBA while Madoka manages the B-Pit. Madoka tells Tsubasa some news and which Tsubasa replies. Later, Madoka is about to open the door for the B-Pit where subsequently, a group of young children in a large pack, startle and surprise Madoka. Zyro is then shown to be walking along, finding Bladers battling and training. One such Blader makes a mistake and accidentally shoots his Beyblade near Zero. The Blader apologized, but Zyro does not mind and happily gives him his Bey back. The boy thanks Zyro and tells him of a tournament that is happening close to the training site. Zyro is surprised, and dashes to the tournament. Zyro gets to the tournament, and is totally in awe. He finds that the tournament is not like normal ones, in fact, it is based on Zero-G. Beyblade has entered a new era, where BeyStadiums now move and completely change the game like never before. Mal, a fellow Beyblade mechanic much like Madoka, is watching the battle as she analyses it with her BeyComputer. Zyro takes a gander at the battle, seeing how the BeyStadium they are in, is remotely large. With Bladers standing on platforms held in the air where the BeyStadium moves in a circular motion as the Beys fight. Drastically adding more factors to the battle and making it more enjoyable and suspenseful. The battle ends, and Zyro wants to go next. Three Bladers stop Zyro and tell him that they are next in line and Zyro will have to wait. Zyro tells him that he is very eager to battle as this is his first time battling in Zero-G. The three Bladers make a compromise with Zyro and tell him he can go next as long as they fight Zyro, in a 9 vs. 1. Zyro agrees, much to their surprise and prepare for it.

        "Zyro accept nonetheless and the two prepare their Beys. With Zyro and his Samurai Ifrit, they will be giving it their all against Shinobu and his Ninja Salamander. Zyro Kurogane and the \"Invincible Salamaner\", Shinobu Hiry\u016bin are in the premise of their battle; a battle royale. With Zyro eager to take on the BeyPark's No. 1 Blader, while Shinobu wants to show Zyro what happens to those, who change the ways of the BeyPark. They both get ready to do battle in the humongous Zero-G Stadium, with their Beys being set up and ready to shoot, they prepare for their match. They are finally ready, \"Let It Rip!\" and begin the battle. Zyro commands Samurai Ifrit to get some hits at Shinobu's bey, Ninja Salamander. It is nothing but useless, as Shinobu is having Salamander dodge and use the Stadium's slope to his very advantage. Zyro is not very keen on this and tries his best to use some counters and such, but to no luck. Shinobu continues to play and toy with Zyro and his Samurai Ifraid, making Zyro even more furious and desperate to find a way. Zyro then commands Ifrit to strike a direct hit at Salamander, yet it too, is futile when Salamander dodges. Zyro seems to have had enough and won't take it any longer, so he has Ifrit attack once more, yet Ninja Salamander dodged again and throws Samurai Ifrit up into the air. Zyro uses this as his advantage as he begins his special move, Shooting Star Crush. Samurai Ifrit uses this and strikes downward, aiming to knockout Ninja Salamander. Shinobu however, is shocked and worred at this and in a quick reflex, commands Salamander to dodge it. However as a result, several cracks and heavy damage is done to the Stadium's centre, shocking nearly everyone; including Zyro Kurogane. Shinobu uses this as his advantage with Salamander getting direct hits and in the end, pushes Ifrit to an escape pocket of the Zero-G Stadium and knocks-out Samurai Ifrit. Giving Shinobu Hiry\u016bin the win, and ending Zyro Kurogane's consecutive victories. Zyro is quite shocked and leaves the BeyPark afterward. Zyro is then walking on the sidewalk, thinking of the battle he just had. He is respective towards Shinobu's strength and power, but will need to be more powerful before he thinks he can take on the Invincible Salamander. He heads to a burger joint; which happens to be owned by Benkei Hanawa. As Zyro enters, the owner, Benkei gives Zyro a meal consisting of a triple-beef burger, side fries, and a beverage. Zyro marvels at Benkei's generosity and eats the triple-beef burger, enjoying it so with delight. Mal then pops out of nowhere, eating some of Zyro's fries, while startling Zyro. Zyro tells Benkei that he just had a battle with Shinobu Hiry\u016bin, and is trembling at what to do. He wants to get stronger, but with the immerse power Shinobu holds, Zyro doesn't think his luck will do him any good. Zyro also tells that he wants to match the likes of No. 1 Blader, Gingka Hagane, and become the next No. 1. Benkei is skeptical at first, yet tells Zyro that he himself knew of Gingka, as well as former Beyblade legend, Kyoya Tategami; who Zyro appears to be unaware of. Kyoya was an old friend of Benkei, yet in a long time, Benkei hasn't seem him. Just then, Benkei tells Zyro that he decided he will train Zyro to become stronger than Shinobu and match the likes of Gingka Hagane. Zyro is very thankful towards Benkei while Mal tells the two she will help as well. With two people to Zyro, he'll do all he can to train to his fullest and become even stronger than before.",

        "Zyro Kurogane is in the midst of his training. Benkei Hanawa, an old friend of Gingka Hagane has a kindred spirit that Zyro found in him. Zyro's passion for becoming the next No. 1 and to defeating Shinobu Hiry\u016bin showed Benkei his potential, and with this, he and Mal have agreed to be helping him. Zyro starts off by running along the slope of a street hill, while tied to a platform, of which Mal is happily sitting on. Benkei is right next to them, riding on a sort of motorcycle, as he encourages Zyro to get to his best. The process is difficult for Zyro as he is trying his best to not giving up. Yet, when Benkei tells Zyro that he'll never beat Shinobu if he does not pass this, Zyro angers at the name and at the moment, Zyro speeded up along the hill. For the next training, Benkei orders Zyro to hold two pails of water, while his arms go straight. The catch is, he has to stay still and not move a single muscle at all. This too is very hard for Zyro yet Benkei tells him he made the time; and as a result, caves in and collapses to the ground, in pain and agony. Later trainings include Zyro getting into a bunked outside bed, and launching his Bey from there while not getting tied up, committing push-ups with Mal on his back, squat thrusts while carrying Mal, and lastly, sit-ups. Then comes dawn where Shinobu is seen, thinking to the previous battle. He finds Zyro dashing at the hill, which startles Shinobu for a second. Later, at Benkei's burger-shop, the gang take a break and eat some of Benkei's famous burgers. Mal later talks to Madoka of some occurrence. The next day, Zyro is seen doing the first exercise he made, running along a hill yet without Mal, instead three platforms this time. Zyro puts full throttle into this yet finds an occurrence with a skateboarding young boy. He asks Zyro what and why is he running alongside a hill, to which Zyro responds to becoming the next No. 1 Blader. The boy questions this and wonders why; he even makes fun of Zyro, much to Zyro's anger. Eight then decides to leave away on his skateboard. Mal is on her way to get back to Zero in training yet the boy is dashing in front of her. He then quickly jumps and apologizes to her, yet it startles Mal and brings her to the ground. Zyro is shocked and stops his training to go look at Mal. Mal tells him he's okay and that boy they met just now, is known as Eight Unabara. Zyro does not know who Eight is, but decides he's ready to face Shinobu for a rematch. Zyro and Mal travel back to BeyPark where subsequently, a battle's occurring. The battle is between the earlier boy, Eight and another Blader. Eight wins the match with ease. He then goes to the other Blader and grabs a black marker. He draws two stars on the Blader's eyes and thus, scaring him and running away. Eight does not seem to feel any sorrow and just plain amuses himself, having a hearty laugh at what he just did. Zyro goes up to Eight and tells him that wasn't a very nice thing to do. With it, Zyro challenges Eight to a battle, in order to make him pay for what he did. Eight casually agrees to the battle in the Zero-G Stadium. Zyro shows him his Bey, Samurai Ifrit while Eight showcases his, Pirate Orochi. The two get up on their platforms and \"Let It Rip!\" their Beys. Zyro is gonna put his full strength because he wants to show Eight at what he has done, and show him, he's not a fool of himself.",
        "Zyro Kurogane is in the midst of his training. Benkei Hanawa, an old friend of Gingka Hagane has a kindred spirit that Zyro found in him. Zyro's passion for becoming the next No. 1 and to defeating Shinobu Hiry\u016bin showed Benkei his potential, and with this, he and Mal have agreed to be helping him. Zyro starts off by running along the slope of a street hill, while tied to a platform, of which Mal is happily sitting on. Benkei is right next to them, riding on a sort of motorcycle, as he encourages Zyro to get to his best. The process is difficult for Zyro as he is trying his best to not giving up. Yet, when Benkei tells Zyro that he'll never beat Shinobu if he does not pass this, Zyro angers at the name and at the moment, Zyro speeded up along the hill. For the next training, Benkei orders Zyro to hold two pails of water, while his arms go straight. The catch is, he has to stay still and not move a single muscle at all. This too is very hard for Zyro yet Benkei tells him he made the time; and as a result, caves in and collapses to the ground, in pain and agony. Later trainings include Zyro getting into a bunked outside bed, and launching his Bey from there while not getting tied up, committing push-ups with Mal on his back, squat thrusts while carrying Mal, and lastly, sit-ups. Then comes dawn where Shinobu is seen, thinking to the previous battle. He finds Zyro dashing at the hill, which startles Shinobu for a second. Later, at Benkei's burger-shop, the gang take a break and eat some of Benkei's famous burgers. Mal later talks to Madoka of some occurrence. The next day, Zyro is seen doing the first exercise he made, running along a hill yet without Mal, instead three platforms this time.

        "Zyro Kurogane and Eight Unabara ready their stances, for their first battle and at the sound of \"3... 2... 1... Let It Rip!\", they fiercely launch their Beyblades into all the force they can achieve, they have entered the Zero-G. Eight of course, is easy-going and laid-back, thinking Zyro will not cause much damage to Eight's own Beyblade, Pirate Orochi. Zyro still, with his Samurai Ifrit do all the best they can to attack Pirate Orochi with all he can do. This turns downhill however, as Eight commands Pirate Orochi to chase Samurai Ifrit in hot pursuit. Zyro doesn't seem startled at all and turns the table on it. Eight is still though, relaxed and reassured, as if nothing Zyro does can change Eight's attitude. Mal and Madoka along with many other Bladers are the spectators with Benkei appearing to see battle unfold. Mal explains to them of the Zero-G Stadium's swaying, how it's giving Eight's Orochi the advantage and proving biased against Zyro's Ifraid. Benkei still knows that there is hope, as Zyro did not go through all that training for nothing. Eight as calm as always, has Pirate Orochi skid through the Stadium, much like how Eight rides his skateboard. Zyro is very tempted by this and tries to find out, someway to stop it. Zyro is steady, knowing he has to do something quick or fail at nothing. He has Samurai Ifrit ram at Pirate Orochi, misses, and then starts to use the swaying of the Zero-G Stadium to switch advantages. Eventually, surprising the mass audience, everyone is shocked with how Samurai Ifrit's quick advantage has done something never-before-seen. The Zero-G Stadium is actually swaying around, being very chatoic in movement, and challenging the battle even more intensely. Mal analyzes this with her BeyComputer and sees that Samurai Ifrit has greatly shifted the whole battle. While Zyro knows it is time to finish it, and so he does. He commands Ifrit, in a burning blaze of fire, while engulfed by it, commands a Special move. The motif of Samurai Ifrit appears and flashes, with Samurai Ifrit's beast appearing and attacking Pirate Orochi. After the climax of it all, Pirate Orochi has been knocked-out by Samurai Ifrit; Zyro Kurogane has defeated Eight Unabara in the Zero-G Stadium with the audience cheering in delight. Zyro approaches Eight and tells them that they had a great game, despite Eight's loss. Eight is disappointed however, accepting Zyro's sportsmanship, but very sad at his losing. Mal then comes up to Eight and tells him how it feels like to lose a battle; she grabs a black marker, similar to the one Eight uses, and similarly, draws black eye and mustache designs on Eight's face. Eight is very startled and runs off in fear. Complaining at what Mal did and swearing to come back with his brother to get revenge. He runs off away, whining and complaining.

Everyone comments on how Orochi has lost, while Benkei and Mal compliment Zyro, who is ecstatic about his victory. Later the next day, everyone around Metal Bey City is talking about Eight's loss and Zyro's strategy on beating his Orochi. Bladers have visited the B-Pit attempting to improve their Beys to be like Zero. Zero is now a local idol. Shinobu is shown battling a Blader in the local Bey Park, merely toying with him and not putting any effort in at all. Zyro shows up and challenges Shinobu. Mal comments on how much stronger Zyro has become in an attempt to lure Shinobu in. Everyone is amazed at the challenge as they stare at Zyro. Shinobu finishes off the Blader and walks away, refusing to battle Zyro. Zyro then hops into battling against Bladers in the Zero-G Stadium. Again and again, he continues to win with one-hit-KOs, vowing to become even stronger. The Bey Park Bladers are amazed at Zyro's power and appear frightened. Mal comments that Zyro's burning revenge and desire to battle Shinobu is driving pushing him to his limits and bringing out his power. Madoka and Benkei discuss about Zyro and Shinobu, and how their next battle will be hard to predict. Tsubasa appears and interrupts their conversation, shocking both Madoka and Benkei. Tsubasa mentions that, in order to test Zyro's power, and give him a chance to battle Shinobu, he is running a Tournament. Benkei offers to sponsor the tournament. The next day, Video Screens around Metal Bey City are showing a video of Blader Gai, who is informing Bladers of the Bey Park 1-Day Tournament. Shinobu appears shocked to hear of this. Benkei informs Zyro of the 1-Day Tournament, and how Bull Burger is sponsoring the Tournament. He also explains that the Zero-G Stadium is used by default, and that Shinobu will more than likely enter. Zyro jumps at this, realising that, if he and Shinobu reach the finals, Shinobu will be forced to battle him. Benkei explains to Zyro that Ifrit has more power than Zyro realises, and that he must learn to use it. Knowing this, Zyro finishes his burger and runs out of the restaurant to begin some bonus training. Later that night, Zyro puts that training to the test at the Bey Park, testing his launch power and Ifrit's speed. Ifrit's speed rocks the Stadium violently as Zyro swears to win. The next day, the 1-Day Tournament begins. Both Shinobu and Zyro easily take out their opponents with One-Hit-KOs. Mal comments that Ifrit's power has increased even further since battling Eight's Orochi. Madoka comments that it is a good thing and shows Zyro is working hard. Eight is shown with his brother, Kite. Both are observing the matches and Eight tells Kite that Zyro is the Blader who defeated him. Interested, Kite gets out his laptop and begins collecting data, agreeing with Eight's idea of battling Zyro himself. Everyone observes as Zyro and Shinobu storm through the tournament with great ease. Blader Gai then announces the final battle; Zyro Kurogane vs. Shinobu Hiryuin. Both Bladers take their positions on the platforms. Zyro then calls over to Shinobu, saying that he will win and prove how much stronger he has become.

Everyone comments on how Orochi has lost, while Benkei and Mal compliment Zyro, who is ecstatic about his victory. Later the next day, everyone around Metal Bey City is talking about Eight's loss and Zyro's strategy on beating his Orochi. Bladers have visited the B-Pit attempting to improve their Beys to be like Zero. Zero is now a local idol. Shinobu is shown battling a Blader in the local Bey Park, merely toying with him and not putting any effort in at all. Zyro shows up and challenges Shinobu. Mal comments on how much stronger Zyro has become in an attempt to lure Shinobu in. Everyone is amazed at the challenge as they stare at Zyro. Shinobu finishes off the Blader and walks away, refusing to battle Zyro. Zyro then hops into battling against Bladers in the Zero-G Stadium. Again and again, he continues to win with one-hit-KOs, vowing to become even stronger. The Bey Park Bladers are amazed at Zyro's power and appear frightened. Mal comments that Zyro's burning revenge and desire to battle Shinobu is driving pushing him to his limits and bringing out his power. Madoka and Benkei discuss about Zyro and Shinobu, and how their next battle will be hard to predict. Tsubasa appears and interrupts their conversation, shocking both Madoka and Benkei. Tsubasa mentions that, in order to test Zyro's power, and give him a chance to battle Shinobu, he is running a Tournament. Benkei offers to sponsor the tournament. The next day, Video Screens around Metal Bey City are showing a video of Blader Gai, who is informing Bladers of the Bey Park 1-Day Tournament. Shinobu appears shocked to hear of this. Benkei informs Zyro of the 1-Day Tournament, and how Bull Burger is sponsoring the Tournament. He also explains that the Zero-G Stadium is used by default, and that Shinobu will more than likely enter. Zyro jumps at this, realising that, if he and Shinobu reach the finals, Shinobu will be forced to battle him. Benkei explains to Zyro that Ifrit has more power than Zyro realises, and that he must learn to use it. Knowing this, Zyro finishes his burger and runs out of the restaurant to begin some bonus training. Later that night, Zyro puts that training to the test at the Bey Park, testing his launch power and Ifrit's speed. Ifrit's speed rocks the Stadium violently as Zyro swears to win. The next day, the 1-Day Tournament begins. Both Shinobu and Zyro easily take out their opponents with One-Hit-KOs. Mal comments that Ifrit's power has increased even further since battling Eight's Orochi. Madoka comments that it is a good thing and shows Zyro is working hard.

They all cheer and get ready for the epic training to build up. The first part consists of Zyro and Shinobu running a multitude of laps to discover who is the fastest among them. They ready themselves and take off in a dash, with Mal hosting the laps. After 10 laps, the two are still up and raring to go, while by lap 20, they turn tired and by over 30 laps, Zyro and Shinobu give up as they cannot take the running any much longer. More exercises follow, with Zyro and Shinobu doing various activities. One such is rock-climbing where once Zyro and Shinobu get to the top, they both fall down in pain and agony as yells follow from them both. After the training, it ends, with Benkei rewarding Zyro and Shinobu with BBQ burgers for them all due to a job well done.

While preparing, Ren spots the key to the local BeyPark hanging up and quickly grabs it, being as discreet as possible in the process. After the work is done, Ren immediately leaves, puzzling Benkei, who thought she would at least stay and have a meal on the house. Zyro expresses concern as she leaves. Shinobu begins training against a boulder, trying to increase his strength for a special move. However, Salamander quickly spins out with barrage attacks, much to his dismay.

Here, this monsters comes out of the ocean and attacks anybody at the beach. The monster is said to resemble a dark and beastly ghoul, covered in seaweed with glowing red eyes, flashing. The man then concludes that it is just an urban myth and they should not worry, with a laugh of relief following. However, a monster then comes out of the water and attacks the people, calling it the monster they spoke of. The next day, Zyro and Co. have decided to go to Midsummer Beach for some rest and relaxation, to take their mind off Beyblade. Everyone has put their swimwear on, all very happy and playing at the beach. Benkei however, commands Zyro for more training, despite Zyro's refusal. Telling him that in order to become the best, he'll still have to do more training. Zyro accepts anyway as he is told to tie a rubber wheel with rope on his waist and run with it.

        "Zyro and Co. have just met the true identity of the \"sea monster,\" Gen Kinokura. Upon their unusual encounter, the gang discuss what they should do, now that they've met him. Gen stops them there and tells them his back story. The reason why Gen poses as a sea monster, is because he cares deeply for beaches. However, beaches have become infested and inhabitable because of the trash and litter the people recklessly put everyday. Gen only cares for the beach, and he'll never stop as the monster unless people care for their beach. Zyro thinks he should Beybattle Gen to stop his terrible goals, yet Kite believes he himself should challenge Gen. Gen agrees to the challenge and the gang move to a water-esque BeyStadium to do battle. The competitors \"Let It Rip!\" and the battle begins. Mal studies Gen's Beyblade, known as Pirate Kraken and discovers something that will make the battle hard for Kite. Kraken uses the A230 Spin Track, which blocks low-attacks such as from Kite's Guardian Leviathan. A230 not only gives Gen the advantage, but stalls the battle completely. The Beybattle, originally a fight becomes a sleep-out where Kite and Gen wait impatiently for their opponent's Beyblade to stop its spin. Outside water even retreats to the BeyStadium and causes no effect. This causes everyone else besides Zyro to enjoy some summer fun rather than the boring battle. Zyro then yells out randomly and commands the battle to end, with no winner due to no result, at anytime soon. Zyro tells Gen that he will fight him next, this time with a result. Zyro and Gen ready their Beys and launch into the Stadium. As hard as the battle was on Kite and Leviathan, it's the same with Zyro and Ifrit. Only worse because Samurai Ifrit is of a lower-Track then Leviathan. Zyro pulls through though, and in order to end it: he commands Samurai Ifrit to take the skies and crash back down on Kraken with his special move, Shooting Star Crush.

The audience is very excited and note Zyro's strength; they begin to ask Zero for a challenge. Zyro, excited, agrees to all of their challenges. The scene shifts to another Zero-G Stadium as well, where Shinobu is battling another opponent but, because of his amazing strength, he also knocks out the opponent's Bey easily with a sneak attack. The scene shifts once again as a recap of the events when Ren battled Takanosuke and the secretive, Sakyo Kuroyami appeared out of the shadows. Ren begins to get angry and challenges Sakyo in a rematch battle. Despite this, Sakyo is merely cocky and states that his Ronin Dragoon is a powerful Beyblade, and tells about how it is Left-Spin capable. Takanosuke then remembers the time when Gingka fought Ryuga who also had the Left-Spinning Bey, L-Drago, seven years ago. Ren believes that she still can defeat his Bey, no matter how strong, or even if it doesn't spin right. The two Bladers shoot their Beys, and Ren starts the battle with an attack. Dragoon and Phoenix begin clashing, but Dragoon unleashes its strength once again, and smashes Phoenix out of the stadium. However, because of the impact, Ren is also sent flying back, but Takanosuke saves her from collapsing on the ground. As a result, it angers Takanosuke and tells Sakyo that he will definitely pay for his wrongdoing. Takanosuke and Sakyo battle again, but Takanosuke reveals his true potential and sneak attacks Dragoon. They clash head on, but even Griffin is not tough enough to defeat Dragoon. Sakyo showcases Dragooon's ultimate power and single-handedly defeats Griffin, but also crashes the stadium into the air. Takanosuke is very surprised, and asks what kind of Bey does Sakyo possess. Sakyo shows off his Left-Spinning Bey, Ronin Dragoon, and tells that it is the strongest Bey ever to exist. Takanosuke then follows Sakyo in order to learn more about this mysterious Bey. Back at Shinobu's battle, he has defeated most of his opponents with ease, including Zyro. Meanwhile however, in the back are a vicious team of Bladers, laughing at Zyro. Their mysterious leader, Akuya Onizaki, pushes Zyro to the back, and challenges him to a Beybattle. Akuya gets a confidence of cockiness when he tells the audience that Zyro will lose. Akuya even frightens the crowd, making Mal enraged that she states Akuya will lose against Zyro. Zyro accepts his challenge, and the battle truly begins. Elsewhere, Shinobu is walking, yet Sakyo appears with Takanosuke. Takanosuke mentions Shinobu's name, and Sakyo wonders who this Blader could be. Sakyo then challenges Shinobu to a fierce battle. With Dragoon's beast roaring, Shinobu and Sakyo stare contently as they anticipate their battle.",

        "Continuing the Zero-G Stadium battles, Zyro Kurogane fights a Blader in a green Zero-G Stadium. His Samurai Ifrit knocks the opponent's Beyblade out easily, surprising the crowd. The audience is very excited and note Zyro's strength; they begin to ask Zero for a challenge. Zyro, excited, agrees to all of their challenges. The scene shifts to another Zero-G Stadium as well, where Shinobu is battling another opponent but, because of his amazing strength, he also knocks out the opponent's Bey easily with a sneak attack. The scene shifts once again as a recap of the events when Ren battled Takanosuke and the secretive, Sakyo Kuroyami appeared out of the shadows. Ren begins to get angry and challenges Sakyo in a rematch battle. Despite this, Sakyo is merely cocky and states that his Ronin Dragoon is a powerful Beyblade, and tells about how it is Left-Spin capable. Takanosuke then remembers the time when Gingka fought Ryuga who also had the Left-Spinning Bey, L-Drago, seven years ago. Ren believes that she still can defeat his Bey, no matter how strong, or even if it doesn't spin right. The two Bladers shoot their Beys, and Ren starts the battle with an attack. Dragoon and Phoenix begin clashing, but Dragoon unleashes its strength once again, and smashes Phoenix out of the stadium. However, because of the impact, Ren is also sent flying back, but Takanosuke saves her from collapsing on the ground. As a result, it angers Takanosuke and tells Sakyo that he will definitely pay for his wrongdoing. Takanosuke and Sakyo battle again, but Takanosuke reveals his true potential and sneak attacks Dragoon. They clash head on, but even Griffin is not tough enough to defeat Dragoon. Sakyo showcases Dragooon's ultimate power and single-handedly defeats Griffin, but also crashes the stadium into the air. Takanosuke is very surprised, and asks what kind of Bey does Sakyo possess. Sakyo shows off his Left-Spinning Bey, Ronin Dragoon, and tells that it is the strongest Bey ever to exist. Takanosuke then follows Sakyo in order to learn more about this mysterious Bey. Back at Shinobu's battle, he has defeated most of his opponents with ease, including Zyro. Meanwhile however, in the back are a vicious team of Bladers, laughing at Zyro. Their mysterious leader, Akuya Onizaki, pushes Zyro to the back, and challenges him to a Beybattle. Akuya gets a confidence of cockiness when he tells the audience that Zyro will lose. Akuya even frightens the crowd, making Mal enraged that she states Akuya will lose against Zyro. Zyro accepts his challenge, and the battle truly begins.

With Zyro and Co., Eight explains to Kite how he battled with Yoshio after he terrorized many Bladers with his Bey, Bandit Golem. In response, Eight impersonated Kite, the person Yoshio searched for and battled him, ultimately losing in the process. Although safe, Eight did manage to obtain a small wound on his elbow, safely covered by a bandage. Outraged by this, Kite demands to find Yoshio and make him pay for his actions. That night, Kite commits to some special training before he intended battle with Yoshio. Eight arrives soon, offering Kite the water bottle and sandwiches that he subsequently turned down the other day. Accepting it, Kite deeply apologizes for letting Eight to obtain a battle wound. Eight takes it lightly however, and is just glad that Kite is with him. The following day at the Bey Park, Yoshio just finished a victorious fight. Out of nowhere, Kite arrives with his friends, there to challenge and defeat Yoshio for assaulting his defense-less brother. Following this further, he introduces as the true Kite Unabara, whom Yoshio was seeking. Satisfied, Yoshio agrees and they begin their battle. Starting off calm, Yoshio's Bandit Golem throws down against Kite's Guardian Leviathan. Yoshio finally intends to discover who of the two is the real defender. One clash causes both Beys to spring back. Still fighting, Golem takes the lead and subdues Leviathan even further with more hits. Mal studies the actions behind Bandit Golem as it progresses. Suddenly, Kite just snaps out of his current persona and becomes enraged just like his first battle with Zyro.

Despite this, Yoshio commands Golem to break away.

The battle's intense fury is starting to heat Zero as he grows a fierce fiery aura in this epic battle against Yoshio. Yet after some other attacks onto Golem, Zyro becomes intensified in the battle for him to unleash his fury. Zyro uses his special move, Burning Uppercut, yelling out and using all of its known power. Ifrit gives multiple barrages to Golem which results in the latter being thrown back, hitting the surface and losing; ultimately giving Zyro the win he needed. As Zyro rejoices in his proudful yet difficult challenge, Yoshio is just totally shocked and moans to the loss of his formerly unbeatable Bey. Out of nowhere however, a speeding Beyblade infiltrates the Zero-G Stadium and dashes right into Golem, sending it flying to the outer-reaches of the BeyStadium with Yoshio in total distraught. Zyro and Co. are caught off guard as well when they discover the mysterious Bey's owner, Kira Hayama. After introducing himself to everyone, he introduces his bey, Berserker Behemoth. Kira has come for a Bey battle and does not plan on leaving until he is given one; with Shinobu stepping up to take his challenge. Accepting this, as Shinobu is the \"Invincible Salamander\" after-all, they get into battle position and launch their Beys. While Behemoth faces-off with Salamander, Mal checks on her laptop for an inside-look at Berserker Behemoth; only to show her and the rest with extraordinary results. With all of these newly-discovered parts, they find Kira's Bey to wield SR200: a Stamina Ring built to defend and conserve Stamina and BWD: a larger version of Wide Defense constructed to improve the overall-Stamina. While Behemoth seems a worthy opponent for Salamander, Shinobu still does not give up as he commands his Bey to deliver not only hits to the Chrome Wheel, but the Stamina Ring as well. All is said and done when Shinobu intends to finsh it with his special move, Phantom Fire Shot. Kira just shows another trick up his sleeve by activating a strange eye-piece on his right eye to see through all of Ninja Salamander's disguises and attack the real one essentially defeating it and taking a win. Shinobu is pummeled back in the air from an explosion with his team coming to his aid, while Yoshio is approached by Kira. He then challenges Zyro to a Synchrom battle.",

Disregarding this, Kira discusses matters about the WBBA and suggests that they head back to their home for something, \"special\" to happen. Retreating to the WBBA headquarters, Zyro and Co. are met by Tsubasa and Amano whom, announce a revival of an original and popular tournament approximately seven years ago; Neo Battle Bladers. Announcing the rules and regulations of the tournament, it focuses on tag-team battles in a similar manner to the World Beyblade Championship. Taking this into account, they are set to focus on the aspects of Synchrom with tag-teams of Bladers using their Beys in Synchrom to win.

As Yoshio and Kite walk to a BeyStadium to commence their battle, five gangmembers surround Yoshio, each arming their Beyblades as him while a voice commands them. Revealed as Akuya, he wishes to pit Yoshio in a six-way battle of him against Akuya and his teammates. While not intimated at all, he gladly accepts as he launches out Bandit Golem and the others do the same. Ultimately, the five beys trap Golem just long enough for Gargole to come in and fight. Back at Zyro's battle with Spike, the beys clash in an epic battle as the Blader of Fire must find a way to defeat this also Fire-elemental Beyblade.

Meanwhile, Kira and Yoshio exchange a talk with the Unabara brothers, conversating about the so-called Leviathan who was the top in the lineage of Defense-Types. Still infuriated with the outcome and the fact he never collected a rematch, Kite furiously challenges Yoshio to a rematch to finally decide the better defender: Golem or Leviathan. While Yoshio accepts, his master Kira, gets a battle with Eight as they all compete for a position in Neo Battle Bladers. As Yoshio and Kite walk to a BeyStadium to commence their battle, five gangmembers surround Yoshio, each arming their Beyblades as him while a voice commands them. Revealed as Akuya, he wishes to pit Yoshio in a six-way battle of him against Akuya and his teammates. While not intimated at all, he gladly accepts as he launches out Bandit Golem and the others do the same. Ultimately, the five beys trap Golem just long enough for Gargole to come in and fight. Back at Zyro's battle with Spike, the beys clash in an epic battle as the Blader of Fire must find a way to defeat this also Fire-elemental Beyblade. Using the WA130HF combo, Thief Girago clashes and smacks Ifrit with multiple slashes while Samurai Ifrit does the same to counter-attack. Mal uses her computer to research Thief Girago, fearing the outcome and hoping Zyro wins, with Takanosuke feels the same.

        "As the battles to enter in Neo Battle Bladers rages on, Zyro is on a roll with consecutive wins and victories as he leads into victory. Despite this, he just obtained an unwelcome visit from Sakyo and Takanosuke, the former of which would like a battle with Zyro to enter in Neo Battle Bladers. Remembering their past fight and the fury Ronin Dragoon held, Zyro accepts as he and Sakyo prepare for a fight. Unexpectedly yet again, a new Blader barges into the tournament to confront Zyro, himself. Known as Spike Bourne, Spike challenges Zyro for a battle in Neo Battle Bladers, causing Zyro to be distracted and forget his planned rematch with Sakyo. Holding his beyblade, Thief Girago, he pits it against Zyro's Samurai Ifrit and with it, the sound goes off to signal their battle.

        "In Neo Battle Bladers, the battles become fiercer and more difficult as every competitor moves on to a new opponent. In Kite's case, he shows nor restraint when he consistently knocks-out the beys of Akuya's gang. His younger brother, Eight, however shows decent signs of his battle with the Dragon Killer, Kira. Although doing his best to survive every hit, Kira's Berserker Behemoth delivers a barrage of hits to Eight's Pirate Orochi who Eight is counting on to survive the round. In Zyro's battles with Spike, he is undergoing the heat of the moment. Every moment that Spike hits the air in fury and craze, his Thief Girago launches an attack onto Zyro's Samurai Ifrit. Zero shows signs of losing it because he knows he must think fast or lose the fight. With a scorching aura of flames, the Blader of Fire commences his special move, Burning Uppercut. Samurai Ifrit's beast appears and it smashes Girago with his blazing katana. Girago undergoes a ricochet out of the Stadium, losing. Although Zyro is quite pleased with himself with the outcome, Spike is rather, acceptante of it as he calls on to his fellow DNA member, Genj\u016br\u014d. Announcing his defeat and his offer to challenge Zyro, Genj\u016br\u014d accepts as he gets on stage for the fight. He introduces himself to Zyro along with his goal of being a member of DNA, intimating Zyro. While Zyro decides to begin this fight, Sakyo confronts him and tells Zyro that he instead, will fight Genj\u016br\u014d. Sakyo and Genj\u016br\u014d \"Let It Rip!\" as the Dark Knight faces off with the Black Tortoise. As The Beyblades first begin to clash into combat, Genj\u016br\u014d commands a special move which signals Bandid Genbu's beast to appear. Surprised by this, Sakyo does the same when Ronin Dragoon's comes in as well. Deciding he has enough of how it already is, he commands Dragoon to attack; which ultimately destroys Genbu with amazing ease of the Dragon Emperor himself. Not surprised by his victory, he tells Zyro that he will be looking forward to battling with him and subsequently leaves to pursue other battles in the tournament. The day starts to turn darker as it becomes evening, just in time for the climax of Akuya and Eight's matches. With his Archer Gargole against Yoshio's Bandit Golem, Yoshio goes in for the finishing blow with a final direct attack that defeats Gargole and Akuya for the win. Pirates Orochi tries to stand still but cannot for Behemoth keeps \"biting away\" at the bey. All is said and done once Kira uses Behemoth's special move, Iron Frail, when it delivers one of the most powerful hits of Beyblade, with Kira winning the fight. Eight collapses out of his reaction to the match where Kite comes in to comfort him. Though Eight feels weak that he cannot fight anymore, he tells Kite to win the match for both of them, so that he can feel the glory of winning that he could not in his fateful match. With Kite very saddened by his loss, he assures him that he will confront Kira and win as a condolence for the fight.

With Zyro, Shinobu, Kite, Sakyo, Yoshio, Kira, Takanosuke and Captain Arrow making it front-and-centre to the audience's applause. Blader Gai announces these eight Bladers, expressing the complete strength and endeavors these persons had to make in order to make their way to the best. The mass audience cheers in delight and enthusiasm, as Mal, Madoka, and Benkei watch from the sidelines as they cheer on Zyro and Shinobu. After the applaud and mood starts to calm down, Gai goes on to announce the first battle of the Best Eight, beginning with the Invincible Salamander, Shinobu against the golem-wielding, Yoshio. Each Blader makes their way to the Zero-G platforms, rising up to Zero-G Stadium and ready to fight face-to-face. Though not surprised of his opponent, Yoshio shows no fear in his current battle while Shinobu feels the same. Getting into launching stance, they Go Shoot! and the battle begins. Shinobi Saramanda facing off with Bandit Golem. The Beyblades first reach contact in a single smack that ricochets both of them. Knowing no fear, the Invincible Salamander quickly offers some hits and smashes to the defendable Golem, as the latter tries to keep up with every hit that comes in. Shinobu decides to follow this up with his special move, Phantom Fire Shot, creating multiple copies of Ninja Salamander to in an attempt to fool Yoshio. Yoshio commands Bandit Golem to go blow away all of the Salamander copies. Yoshio believes he has won when Salamander seems to be circling the stadium creating more and more copies trapping Golem. Finally Shinobu calls a new special move, Soul Ring Assult, creating a burning ring around Golem that closes in and sucker punches Golem into the air giving Shinobu a win by stadium out. Blader Gai subsequently proceeds to announce the follow-up with Kite against the Dragon-Killer, Kira. Intrigued by his opponent, Kite takes his step to the platforms but is halted by his little sibling, Eight. Eight reminds his brother to desperately win the fight for both of them, counting on him to redeem his own loss against Kira. Accepting this with every extent, as Kite finally reaches the Stadium he is met with a surprise when Eight throws his Pirate Chrome Wheel for Kite to catch. He then gets a sense that Eight wants him to practice Synchrom and defeat Kira who is handed the Golem Chrome Wheel by his partner-in-crime, Yoshio for vengeance. The two fierceful Bladers load their Chrome Wheels and Let It Rip! with Kite's Orochi Leviathan fighting edge-on with Kira's Golem Behemoth. Needing to his prove his worth, Kite uses defensive motives against Golem Behemoth's Stamaina one. With two Chrome Wheels for a Synchrom battle, Golem Behemoth heads in for some right and left hooks to Orochi Leviathan as they face off, wheel-to-wheel. Even more smacks, dashes and bursts of attacks follow suit with an explosion to come in for every damage that a Bey takes. Upon the recklessness of he and his opponent when it comes to foul play, Kite is ready to perform a special move in response to Kira's special move, Iron Flail. With Behemoth's beast changing yet again to an even more gruesome and burly beast against the Synchrom-esque, Leviathan infused Orouchi. Deciding the time is right, he has Orochi Leviathan create a tornado that soon enough becomes infused with water to summon forth, a tropical cyclone. This maelstrom of a hurricane comes into the centre of the Beys as both Kira and Kite use their maximum potential to have Golem Behemoth and Orochi Leviathan meet dead-on for the outcome. The cyclone causes an immense and explosive explosion on impact that deals incredible damage dealt to the Zero-G Stadium and filling the audience with immerse fear. In the end however, Orochi Leviathan was unfortunately thrown into a wall and stuck there, whilst Golem Begirados remains in complete spin rotation. Shocked by his loss like how Yoshio was, Kite screams in denial and agony at how this battle could have been, especially failing to redeem Eight.

Both stand onto their Zero-G platforms and await their fight...",
        "Coming up on stage are none other than the Top Eight, the top eight competitors of the tournament full of hype that is, Neo Battle Bladers. With Zyro, Shinobu, Kite, Sakyo, Yoshio, Kira, Takanosuke and Captain Arrow making it front-and-centre to the audience's applause. Blader Gai announces these eight Bladers, expressing the complete strength and endeavors these persons had to make in order to make their way to the best. The mass audience cheers in delight and enthusiasm, as Mal, Madoka, and Benkei watch from the sidelines as they cheer on Zyro and Shinobu. After the applaud and mood starts to calm down, Gai goes on to announce the first battle of the Best Eight, beginning with the Invincible Salamander, Shinobu against the golem-wielding, Yoshio. Each Blader makes their way to the Zero-G platforms, rising up to Zero-G Stadium and ready to fight face-to-face. Though not surprised of his opponent, Yoshio shows no fear in his current battle while Shinobu feels the same. Getting into launching stance, they Go Shoot! and the battle begins. Shinobi Saramanda facing off with Bandit Golem. The Beyblades first reach contact in a single smack that ricochets both of them. Knowing no fear, the Invincible Salamander quickly offers some hits and smashes to the defendable Golem, as the latter tries to keep up with every hit that comes in. Shinobu decides to follow this up with his special move, Phantom Fire Shot, creating multiple copies of Ninja Salamander to in an attempt to fool Yoshio. Yoshio commands Bandit Golem to go blow away all of the Salamander copies. Yoshio believes he has won when Salamander seems to be circling the stadium creating more and more copies trapping Golem. Finally Shinobu calls a new special move, Soul Ring Assult, creating a burning ring around Golem that closes in and sucker punches Golem into the air giving Shinobu a win by stadium out. Blader Gai subsequently proceeds to announce the follow-up with Kite against the Dragon-Killer, Kira. Intrigued by his opponent, Kite takes his step to the platforms but is halted by his little sibling, Eight. Eight reminds his brother to desperately win the fight for both of them, counting on him to redeem his own loss against Kira. Accepting this with every extent, as Kite finally reaches the Stadium he is met with a surprise when Eight throws his Pirate Chrome Wheel for Kite to catch. He then gets a sense that Eight wants him to practice Synchrom and defeat Kira who is handed the Golem Chrome Wheel by his partner-in-crime, Yoshio for vengeance. The two fierceful Bladers load their Chrome Wheels and Let It Rip! with Kite's Orochi Leviathan fighting edge-on with Kira's Golem Behemoth. Needing to his prove his worth, Kite uses defensive motives against Golem Behemoth's Stamaina one. With two Chrome Wheels for a Synchrom battle, Golem Behemoth heads in for some right and left hooks to Orochi Leviathan as they face off, wheel-to-wheel. Even more smacks, dashes and bursts of attacks follow suit with an explosion to come in for every damage that a Bey takes. Upon the recklessness of he and his opponent when it comes to foul play, Kite is ready to perform a special move in response to Kira's special move, Iron Flail. With Behemoth's beast changing yet again to an even more gruesome and burly beast against the Synchrom-esque, Leviathan infused Orouchi. Deciding the time is right, he has Orochi Leviathan create a tornado that soon enough becomes infused with water to summon forth, a tropical cyclone. This maelstrom of a hurricane comes into the centre of the Beys as both Kira and Kite use their maximum potential to have Golem Behemoth and Orochi Leviathan meet dead-on for the outcome. The cyclone causes an immense and explosive explosion on impact that deals incredible damage dealt to the Zero-G Stadium and filling the audience with immerse fear. In the end however, Orochi Leviathan was unfortunately thrown into a wall and stuck there, whilst Golem Begirados remains in complete spin rotation. Shocked by his loss like how Yoshio was, Kite screams in denial and agony at how this battle could have been, especially failing to redeem Eight. Kira is casual about it as always and leaves when Blader Gai announces Kira as the victorious Blader. Team Garcias of DNA are meanwhile seen in a live coverage of Neo Battle Bladers, happy to see everything is continuing to go as planned, never doubting Kira for one second especially when Yoshio failed. Back at Neo Battle Bladers though, Blader Gai announces the next match consiting of Sakyo against the mysterious masquerade-helming, Captain Arrow.

While both Bladers move to their respective Zero-G Stadium platforms, Captain Arrow introduces himself. With his own Beyblade, Archer Wyvern, Arrow intends to easily win this battle after he reveals at how he is also a DNA Blader. This startles Tsubasa, Madoka and Benkei who are affiliated with the WBBA, the enemies of DNA. Knowing that they need Sakyo to defeat the new DNA representative, both Bladers \"Let It Rip!\" and launch their Beyblades. Ronin Dragoon is already receiving barrage attacks by Archer Wyvern, while Sakyo remains as calm as ever. More smashes originate here and there that it seems that Arrow has already figured out the path to victory. This is evident when he already unleashes his special move, \"Arrow Tornado\". An immediate torando of wind bursts out and throws Dragoon away, despite Benkei's comments that Kyoya had made better tornados in his days. Sakyo however reveals that he never really was trying all along and immiedately his focus shifts to turning the tables. Commanding Dragoon to recover from the special move, he has it dash all towards Archer Wyvern. With the beast of Dragoon coming together and tackle the tornado. Subsequently Dark Knight Dragoon goes under Archer Wyvern and flips the latter to have it thrown to the other side of the Stadium. A small hole is created as a result and falls through it to give Sakyo and Dragoon the win. Blader Gai announces Sakyo's victory alongside the audience cheering as well. Although Tsubasa, Madoka, and Benkei are quite relieved that another DNA Blader has been taken down from thr tournament, Selen of DNA is quite angered by the result. Ian shares his concerns as well yet Argo remains very a cosmpoloite, knowing that everything shall come together in due time. Blader Gai then announces the last match of the quarter-finals that will then culminate into the \"Best 4\". The battle will be compromised as Zyro Kurogane versus Takanosuke Shishiya. Zyro and Takanosuke are quite happy that they will be facing each-other, both who have been in the best of training to fight. The launch of their Beyblades comes in as Samurai Ifrit faces against Archer Gryph. Ifrit and Griffin share their first signs of contact that already give off harsh recoil. They do not despair and are still keeping their focus on the Beyblades when Archer Griffin barrages Samurai Ifrit, similar to Sakyo and Arrow's fight. Zyro obtains scruples as a result as Ifrit just sits there helplessly being ravaged by the griffon. With his dogged attempt to meet his idol in the form of Gingka Hagane, Zyro will not stand down by any means. To keep with this he uses his special move, Burning Uppercut. Ifrit bursts out simulatenously when Samurai Ifrit emits a blazing aura. Takanosuke is distraught when Zyro has his Beyblade smack Archer Griffin to the other side of the Zero-G Stadium. Takanosuke, undergoing a distraught that leads him to believe that he has ran out of luck. Feeling week, uneasy and helpless, Takanosuke seeks retribution when his crys call out on getting Griffin to stand together. His cries become the fuel for his Beyblade when it relives itself from Ifrit's special move and heads back into the battlefield. Everyone, Zyro, including the audience were surprised by how quick Takanosuke recovered from that potential move that would have costed him the win. Now that both opponents are more serious than ever, Samurai Ifrit and Archer Griffin clash in an epic battle charged by their owner's determination.

        "With the transition from the quarter-finals to the semi-finals, Blader Gai announces the four Bladers left in Neo Battle Bladers. Consisting of Shinobu Hiry\u016bin, Kira Hayama, Sakyo Kuroyami, and Zyro Kurogane. Subsequently, he details the two battles that will compromise the semi-finals that will later lead to the finals and declare the winner of the tournament. The two battles will consist of Zyro vs. Sakyo with the second as Shinobu vs. Kira. As the audience is loud in its cheering of its competitors, Tsubasa and Madoka are still concerned with DNA. Mal even shows them footage of some of the semi-finals battles via her laptop, trying to comfort them in their DNA scruples. As the evening shifts to nighttime, Shinobu has come to Bey Park along with some friends in order to undergo extensive training prior to his fight with Kira. At first he is fighting Ren as her Thief Phoenix battles Ninja Salamander. Shinobu is able to quickly unleash multiples of Salamander and follow it up with a special move that he first used when defeating Yoshio in the quarter-finals. The Salamanders circled and trapped Phoenix as each Salamander transformed into a ring of fire that was able to blow Phoenix out of the BeyStadium and much to her dismay. Meanwhile, Zyro decides to partake some training for himself elsewhere outside of Metal Bey City. Bringing Benkei along, Zyro returns to the same area where he first had his battle with Sakyo. He had Benkei bring a wrecking ball crane with him, that is to be used for Zyro to counter and defeat. Although Benkei is very skeptical of this, not wanting to endanger Zyro's life or put any hurt on him, Zyro commands Benkei to go through with it, to which the former does, despite his dismay. As Zyro launches out Samurai Ifrit into the ginormous hole mimicking a Stadium, Benkei controls the wrecking ball to circle the hole at its edge. When Ifrit collides with the wrecking ball, it is thrown back immediately which also throws its owner back as well. Zyro does not care and stands up once more to launch Ifrit at the wrecking ball, this time intending to hold it back. While Ifrit does manage to hold the wrecking ball for a short period, it cannot hold much longer as it throws Ifrit back again. With every collision and failure that causes Zyro to be hardly thrown to the ground in hurt, Zyro comes back for another chance at trial-and-error to defeat the wrecking ball. Back at the Bey Park, Kite tells Ren to step aside and give himself a chance at defeating Shinobu. Raised by the platform to the Zero-G Stadium, Kite launches Guardian Leviathan to test Salamander's offensive skills. When the Beys are launched, they immediately deliver the opponent with a barrage of hits and smashes. Kite gives a short speech to Shinobu, telling him that he must defeat Kira in Neo Battle Bladers and advance to the finals at all costs. Knowing how powerful Kira truly is by experience, Kite orders Shinobu to do what he must do and defeat Kira Hayama. Shinobu, moved by the words of his friend, accepts this and acknowledges what it will mean to defeat Kira. Elsewhere at the DNA headquarters, Yoshio is the middle of a battle with Kira. Commanding his Bandit Golem to deliver Berserker Behemoth with one smash, as Golem does this it is suddenly ricocheted out of the BeyStadium with no movement by Behemoth. Yoshio, saddened by his lost, gives Genj\u016br\u014d a turn. As Kira is as calm in his battles, Genj\u016br\u014d launches Bandit Genbu to collide with Behemoth but Genj\u016br\u014d obtains the same result that Yoshio did. Surprised by this, he then gives a turn to Spike and his Thief Girago. Intending to barrage Behemoth with a marathon of clashes, Spike launches Girago but also faces the same result. Shocked by this, he lets Captain Arrow have a chance at combating Behemoth. Launching out Archer Wyvern, Arrow immediately unleashes a tornado that stands atop of Wyvern, while simultaneously using Tornado Attack to attack Behemoth. Flattered by Arrow's dogged practice, Kira chuckles when Berserker Behemoth offers no movement at all and still manages to throw back the opposing Beyblade, in the form of Wyvern. Shocked and feeling what his comrades have, Ian commands the DNA Bladers, expect Yoshio and Kira to leave, and they gladly do so. Kira then exits the Zero-G Stadium to hold his Berserker Behemoth and have a short reminiscing with it. He remember his three, other opponent in the semi-finals, Shinobu, Sakyo and Zyro. Each using the Ring of Fire that defeated Yoshio, an easy attack that defeated Arrow and the Burning Upper that defeated Takanosuke, respectively. A little concerned for how powerful the others are, Merci interrupts Kira's time to himself to announce that the \"dark energy\" collected by Behemoth is now complete and there is no need to use it, anymore. Surprised by this, Kira drops his former Beyblade to the floor, leaving Berserker Behemoth. Yoshio approaches Kira as he watched what Kira has done, asking is he is sure to leave Behemoth and Kira accepts this as the two walk to the soon-to-commence Neo Battle Bladers. Selen and Argo even exchange a short discussion about Beserker Behemoth, as although Selen believed Kira should have kept Behemoth, Argo dismisses it because Kira will have obtained a \"new Beyblade\" even more powerful than the one before and that it will most likely be the most powerful Beyblade that the world have ever known. Finally, the semi-finalists of Neo Battle Bladers have all arrived and are now ready to proceed in their battles. With the audience of the whole tournament cheering loudly in delight, Gai announces that Zyro and Sakyo shall battle first. Subsequently, Zyro and Sakyo enter the Zero-G platforms and make way for their Zero-G battle. Zyro and Sakyo are about to partake in their second battle, ever as Zyro is very dogged to defeat Sakyo following his intensive training, while Sakyo plans to do the same.",

As Kira is as calm in his battles, Genj\u016br\u014d launches Bandit Genbu to collide with Behemoth but Genj\u016br\u014d obtains the same result that Yoshio did. Surprised by this, he then gives a turn to Spike and his Thief Girago. Intending to barrage Behemoth with a marathon of clashes, Spike launches Girago but also faces the same result. Shocked by this, he lets Captain Arrow have a chance at combating Behemoth. Launching out Archer Wyvern, Arrow immediately unleashes a tornado that stands atop of Wyvern, while simultaneously using Tornado Attack to attack Behemoth. Flattered by Arrow's dogged practice, Kira chuckles when Berserker Behemoth offers no movement at all and still manages to throw back the opposing Beyblade, in the form of Wyvern. Shocked and feeling what his comrades have, Ian commands the DNA Bladers, expect Yoshio and Kira to leave, and they gladly do so. Kira then exits the Zero-G Stadium to hold his Berserker Behemoth and have a short reminiscing with it. He remember his three, other opponent in the semi-finals, Shinobu, Sakyo and Zyro. Each using the Ring of Fire that defeated Yoshio, an easy attack that defeated Arrow and the Burning Upper that defeated Takanosuke, respectively. A little concerned for how powerful the others are, Merci interrupts Kira's time to himself to announce that the \"dark energy\" collected by Behemoth is now complete and there is no need to use it, anymore. Surprised by this, Kira drops his former Beyblade to the floor, leaving Berserker Behemoth. Yoshio approaches Kira as he watched what Kira has done, asking is he is sure to leave Behemoth and Kira accepts this as the two walk to the soon-to-commence Neo Battle Bladers. Selen and Argo even exchange a short discussion about Beserker Behemoth, as although Selen believed Kira should have kept Behemoth, Argo dismisses it because Kira will have obtained a \"new Beyblade\" even more powerful than the one before and that it will most likely be the most powerful Beyblade that the world have ever known. Finally, the semi-finalists of Neo Battle Bladers have all arrived and are now ready to proceed in their battles. With the audience of the whole tournament cheering loudly in delight, Gai announces that Zyro and Sakyo shall battle first. Subsequently, Zyro and Sakyo enter the Zero-G platforms and make way for their Zero-G battle. Zyro and Sakyo are about to partake in their second battle, ever as Zyro is very dogged to defeat Sakyo following his intensive training, while Sakyo plans to do the same.",
        "With the transition from the quarter-finals to the semi-finals, Blader Gai announces the four Bladers left in Neo Battle Bladers. Consisting of Shinobu Hiry\u016bin, Kira Hayama, Sakyo Kuroyami, and Zyro Kurogane. Subsequently, he details the two battles that will compromise the semi-finals that will later lead to the finals and declare the winner of the tournament. The two battles will consist of Zyro vs. Sakyo with the second as Shinobu vs. Kira. As the audience is loud in its cheering of its competitors, Tsubasa and Madoka are still concerned with DNA. Mal even shows them footage of some of the semi-finals battles via her laptop, trying to comfort them in their DNA scruples. As the evening shifts to nighttime, Shinobu has come to Bey Park along with some friends in order to undergo extensive training prior to his fight with Kira. At first he is fighting Ren as her Thief Phoenix battles Ninja Salamander. Shinobu is able to quickly unleash multiples of Salamander and follow it up with a special move that he first used when defeating Yoshio in the quarter-finals. The Salamanders circled and trapped Phoenix as each Salamander transformed into a ring of fire that was able to blow Phoenix out of the BeyStadium and much to her dismay. Meanwhile, Zyro decides to partake some training for himself elsewhere outside of Metal Bey City. Bringing Benkei along, Zyro returns to the same area where he first had his battle with Sakyo. He had Benkei bring a wrecking ball crane with him, that is to be used for Zyro to counter and defeat. Although Benkei is very skeptical of this, not wanting to endanger Zyro's life or put any hurt on him, Zyro commands Benkei to go through with it, to which the former does, despite his dismay. As Zyro launches out Samurai Ifrit into the ginormous hole mimicking a Stadium, Benkei controls the wrecking ball to circle the hole at its edge. When Ifrit collides with the wrecking ball, it is thrown back immediately which also throws its owner back as well. Zyro does not care and stands up once more to launch Ifrit at the wrecking ball, this time intending to hold it back. While Ifrit does manage to hold the wrecking ball for a short period, it cannot hold much longer as it throws Ifrit back again. With every collision and failure that causes Zyro to be hardly thrown to the ground in hurt, Zyro comes back for another chance at trial-and-error to defeat the wrecking ball. Back at the Bey Park, Kite tells Ren to step aside and give himself a chance at defeating Shinobu. Raised by the platform to the Zero-G Stadium, Kite launches Guardian Leviathan to test Salamander's offensive skills. When the Beys are launched, they immediately deliver the opponent with a barrage of hits and smashes. Kite gives a short speech to Shinobu, telling him that he must defeat Kira in Neo Battle Bladers and advance to the finals at all costs. Knowing how powerful Kira truly is by experience, Kite orders Shinobu to do what he must do and defeat Kira Hayama. Shinobu, moved by the words of his friend, accepts this and acknowledges what it will mean to defeat Kira. Elsewhere at the DNA headquarters, Yoshio is the middle of a battle with Kira. Commanding his Bandit Golem to deliver Berserker Behemoth with one smash, as Golem does this it is suddenly ricocheted out of the BeyStadium with no movement by Behemoth. Yoshio, saddened by his lost, gives Genj\u016br\u014d a turn.

        "At the signal of \"3... 2... 1... Let It Rip!\", Zyro Kurogane and Sakyo Kuroyami launch out their Beyblades to commence their semi-final match. As soon as Samurai Ifrit and Ronin Dragoon land in the Zero-G Stadium, Blader Gai notices how the two Beys are already delivering some hits. A marathon of barrages are followed as Ifrit knocks away Dragoon with a powerful blow but Dragoon returns to deliver the same exact hit that befalls upon Ifrit. Zero intends to fight to his fiercest in this battle, commanding Ifrit to barrage-smash Dragoon, whilst Sakyo copies this command. Ifrit and Dragooon are locked in combat, presenting extraordinary smashes and smacks to each-other in this battle. Spectating from the sidelines, Takanosuke cheers on Sakyo while Kite, Eight, Ren, and Mal do the same for Zyro, instead. The battle becomes more exciting with each second that passes when Sakyo brings an interesting take to the battle. Ronin Dragoon speeds to the top of the Stadium and then comes running down to hit Samurai Ifrit, sending it flying from the Stadium. The crowd is surprised by this until Zyro manages to have his Ifrit comes crashing down in an enormous impact, but safe from a possible knock-out. This surprises Sakyo as well, and Zyro decides to follow this up with his special move, Burning Uppercut. Harboring a blazing presence, Samurai Ifrit spins at high speeds to collide with Dragoon. When this collision occurs, a massive explosion escapes and affects the whole arena; with massively powerful winds that follow suit. Despite this, Sakyo is able to have Dragoon survive the assault. While the Beys begin barraging each-other once more, vortexes of winds follow through with every collision, as announced by Blader Gai. After a few more attacks, Zyro plans to gain impending speed for Ifrit and allows Ifrit to circle the Stadium to do so. To counter Zyro's attempt, Sakyo has Dragoon circle the Stadium but spins in a path that is greater than that of Ifrit's. With the Right-Spin Ifrit gaining speed, the Left-Spin Dragoon has foiled its plan as Dragoon begins interfering with Ifrit's circle-spin with hits, thus disrupting it and keeping it off of balance. As a result, the two forces of the two Beys' speeding has caused the Zero-G Stadium to stay flat and remove the constant swaying, something noticed by Gai. While the two Beyblades battle it out, Benkei, Tsubasa, and Madoka spectate. Madoka is given fears of the battle, seeing as how Sakyo is quite powerful and that Zyro just may not win this fight. Tsubasa however, quickly defeats her doubts when he reminds her that Zyro's hot-blooded personality and burning passion to meet Gingka Hagane will save them. Zyro is a very powerful Blader, Sakyo is as well but Tsubasa believes that Zyro still has a chance to claim victory in this battle, some evidence supported by how Zyro has yet to have obtained a loss in Neo Battle Bladers. As Zyro and Sakyo duke it out in the BeyStadium, very reminiscent to the match Gingka and Ryuga had seven years ago in the same place at the same time in the original Battle Bladers. With Tsubasa's condolences, Madoka is relieved to have a renewed hope in Zyro. Still watching the battle, Kite, Eight, Ren, and Mal continue to express their cheers for Zyro. With every Blader giving the most confident cheers to their friend, Zyro is able to have heard them and takes some time to shift his focus from the current battle, to his friends. Surprised, Zyro is reminded by how his friends are there and are cheering for him to win the fight. Moved by this, Zyro takes some moments to himself to remember the bonds he has had with his friends. From meeting Shinobu in their first battle, to the Synchrom battle of Eight and Kite and even the training to defeat Yoshio with Shinobu and Ren. Zyro remembers how glad he is to have his friends with him and still there to cheer him in his battle, which greatly moved Zyro. Upon this, Zyro shares a short talk with his opponent. He tells Sakyo that the bonds that he holds with his friends is keeping him from giving up, something that he never fails to achieve. All of these bonds that are held with this friendships allows him to never hold back and go past his limit to fight in even the most dreadful of fights. He tells Sakyo that he has made a mistake to not have anyone with him, instead only thinking that he could fight without the use of friends and that he shows no need for them. Putting the spotlight on Takanosuke, Zyro tells Sakyo that his true friend is Takanosuke, a person who cares about Sakyo in the same way he should to Takanosuke. All along, Sakyo has just had Takanosuke as nothing more than a \"Synchrom partner\", just an aid to help in his training and victories. Zyro tells Sakyo that he should be grateful for having a confidant in the form of Takanosuke and that the bond with him is the only strength that he may use to fight in this battle. While Sakyo seems moved by Zyro's words, Zyro decides to end this battle with a bang when he uses Burning Uppercut again. Aiming to defeat finally defeat Sakyo after their previous battle, Samurai Ifrit is headed towards Ronin Dragoon. Despite this, Sakyo shows an aura of a red-like darkness that escapes his eyes to have a raging power of darkness burst out and for use with Dragoon to enslave the Samurai Ifrit. With a burst of ultimate power held by Sakyo, and the hot-blazing action of Zyro, Ronin Dragoon and Samurai Ifrit come close to their last collision. Immediately, a powerful explosion is let out of the BeyStadium that goes on to create extremely, high wind patterns that force the audience and spectators to cover themselves and hold on from the blow. With giant clouds of dust that are created in response to the explosion, the mist begins to clear to show a shocking scenario. The giant blow held by Ifrit and Dragooon caused the Zero-G Stadium to explode within itself, with the Zero-G Stadium destroyed to giant pieces. The remains are just shattered markings of glass that have fallen to the hard ground, and reveals a Samurai Ifrit that remains in spin. Shocking everybody, including Sakyo; he is confused as to the whereabouts of his Beyblade, but he gets his answer when he finds Ronin Dragoon sent out of the Stadium to have become stuck to placing on a wall but to eventually come crashing down on the BeyStadium floor; Ronin Dragoon is now out-of-spin and has lost the battle with Samurai Ifrit. Gai excitedly announces the outcome of the match, with Zyro and Samurai Ifrit as the winner of the first match of the semi-finals in Neo Battle Bladers, which fortunately for Zyro, allows him to advance to the last round of Neo Battle Bladers: the finals. While Zero is happily excited by his victory, having the audience and his friends cheering for him, with the latter glad for the outcome, Sakyo is quite the opposite. Depressed about his loss, Sakyo comes down from the Zero-G platform and begins exiting it. Takanosuke, sad about Sakyo's loss, rushes out of the audience and dashes to Sakyo. There, Sakyo notices Takanosuke with him while Takanosuke asks if Sakyo is alright. Sakyo, tells Takanosuke that he does not care any much more for the battle but was able to discover something greater, and that was the realization that he had a friend, Takanosuke. Takanosuke is moved by Sakyo's words and is happy to see that Sakyo knows who his true friend is. Now treating him more than just a Synchrom partner, Sakyo now asks rather than commands Takanosuke to come with him, asking him to follow him to commit to some other training, but as friends. Happy at this, Takanosuke eagerly follows Sakyo to their next destination, albeit that Sakyo has left without Ronin Dragoon. Zyro on the other hand, is shouting out at Shinobu, stating that he has won his match and it is not time for Shinobu to win his. Accepting his friend's words, Shinobu promises to battle at his best in his fight with Kira Hayama, in the second and last part of the semi-finals of Neo Battle Bladers.",

While the two Beyblades battle it out, Benkei, Tsubasa, and Madoka spectate. Madoka is given fears of the battle, seeing as how Sakyo is quite powerful and that Zyro just may not win this fight. Tsubasa however, quickly defeats her doubts when he reminds her that Zyro's hot-blooded personality and burning passion to meet Gingka Hagane will save them. Zyro is a very powerful Blader, Sakyo is as well but Tsubasa believes that Zyro still has a chance to claim victory in this battle, some evidence supported by how Zyro has yet to have obtained a loss in Neo Battle Bladers. As Zyro and Sakyo duke it out in the BeyStadium, very reminiscent to the match Gingka and Ryuga had seven years ago in the same place at the same time in the original Battle Bladers. With Tsubasa's condolences, Madoka is relieved to have a renewed hope in Zyro. Still watching the battle, Kite, Eight, Ren, and Mal continue to express their cheers for Zyro. With every Blader giving the most confident cheers to their friend, Zyro is able to have heard them and takes some time to shift his focus from the current battle, to his friends. Surprised, Zyro is reminded by how his friends are there and are cheering for him to win the fight. Moved by this, Zyro takes some moments to himself to remember the bonds he has had with his friends. From meeting Shinobu in their first battle, to the Synchrom battle of Eight and Kite and even the training to defeat Yoshio with Shinobu and Ren. Zyro remembers how glad he is to have his friends with him and still there to cheer him in his battle, which greatly moved Zyro. Upon this, Zyro shares a short talk with his opponent. He tells Sakyo that the bonds that he holds with his friends is keeping him from giving up, something that he never fails to achieve. All of these bonds that are held with this friendships allows him to never hold back and go past his limit to fight in even the most dreadful of fights. He tells Sakyo that he has made a mistake to not have anyone with him, instead only thinking that he could fight without the use of friends and that he shows no need for them. Putting the spotlight on Takanosuke, Zyro tells Sakyo that his true friend is Takanosuke, a person who cares about Sakyo in the same way he should to Takanosuke. All along, Sakyo has just had Takanosuke as nothing more than a \"Synchrom partner\", just an aid to help in his training and victories. Zyro tells Sakyo that he should be grateful for having a confidant in the form of Takanosuke and that the bond with him is the only strength that he may use to fight in this battle. While Sakyo seems moved by Zyro's words, Zyro decides to end this battle with a bang when he uses Burning Uppercut again. Aiming to defeat finally defeat Sakyo after their previous battle, Samurai Ifrit is headed towards Ronin Dragoon. Despite this, Sakyo shows an aura of a red-like darkness that escapes his eyes to have a raging power of darkness burst out and for use with Dragoon to enslave the Samurai Ifrit. With a burst of ultimate power held by Sakyo, and the hot-blazing action of Zyro, Ronin Dragoon and Samurai Ifrit come close to their last collision. Immediately, a powerful explosion is let out of the BeyStadium that goes on to create extremely, high wind patterns that force the audience and spectators to cover themselves and hold on from the blow. With giant clouds of dust that are created in response to the explosion, the mist begins to clear to show a shocking scenario. The giant blow held by Ifrit and Dragooon caused the Zero-G Stadium to explode within itself, with the Zero-G Stadium destroyed to giant pieces. The remains are just shattered markings of glass that have fallen to the hard ground, and reveals a Samurai Ifrit that remains in spin. Shocking everybody, including Sakyo; he is confused as to the whereabouts of his Beyblade, but he gets his answer when he finds Ronin Dragoon sent out of the Stadium to have become stuck to placing on a wall but to eventually come crashing down on the BeyStadium floor; Ronin Dragoon is now out-of-spin and has lost the battle with Samurai Ifrit. Gai excitedly announces the outcome of the match, with Zyro and Samurai Ifrit as the winner of the first match of the semi-finals in Neo Battle Bladers, which fortunately for Zyro, allows him to advance to the last round of Neo Battle Bladers: the finals. While Zero is happily excited by his victory, having the audience and his friends cheering for him, with the latter glad for the outcome, Sakyo is quite the opposite. Depressed about his loss, Sakyo comes down from the Zero-G platform and begins exiting it. Takanosuke, sad about Sakyo's loss, rushes out of the audience and dashes to Sakyo. There, Sakyo notices Takanosuke with him while Takanosuke asks if Sakyo is alright. Sakyo, tells Takanosuke that he does not care any much more for the battle but was able to discover something greater, and that was the realization that he had a friend, Takanosuke. Takanosuke is moved by Sakyo's words and is happy to see that Sakyo knows who his true friend is. Now treating him more than just a Synchrom partner, Sakyo now asks rather than commands Takanosuke to come with him, asking him to follow him to commit to some other training, but as friends. Happy at this, Takanosuke eagerly follows Sakyo to their next destination, albeit that Sakyo has left without Ronin Dragoon. Zyro on the other hand, is shouting out at Shinobu, stating that he has won his match and it is not time for Shinobu to win his. Accepting his friend's words, Shinobu promises to battle at his best in his fight with Kira Hayama, in the second and last part of the semi-finals of Neo Battle Bladers.",
        "At the signal of \"3... 2... 1... Let It Rip!\", Zyro Kurogane and Sakyo Kuroyami launch out their Beyblades to commence their semi-final match. As soon as Samurai Ifrit and Ronin Dragoon land in the Zero-G Stadium, Blader Gai notices how the two Beys are already delivering some hits. A marathon of barrages are followed as Ifrit knocks away Dragoon with a powerful blow but Dragoon returns to deliver the same exact hit that befalls upon Ifrit. Zero intends to fight to his fiercest in this battle, commanding Ifrit to barrage-smash Dragoon, whilst Sakyo copies this command. Ifrit and Dragooon are locked in combat, presenting extraordinary smashes and smacks to each-other in this battle. Spectating from the sidelines, Takanosuke cheers on Sakyo while Kite, Eight, Ren, and Mal do the same for Zyro, instead. The battle becomes more exciting with each second that passes when Sakyo brings an interesting take to the battle. Ronin Dragoon speeds to the top of the Stadium and then comes running down to hit Samurai Ifrit, sending it flying from the Stadium. The crowd is surprised by this until Zyro manages to have his Ifrit comes crashing down in an enormous impact, but safe from a possible knock-out. This surprises Sakyo as well, and Zyro decides to follow this up with his special move, Burning Uppercut. Harboring a blazing presence, Samurai Ifrit spins at high speeds to collide with Dragoon. When this collision occurs, a massive explosion escapes and affects the whole arena; with massively powerful winds that follow suit. Despite this, Sakyo is able to have Dragoon survive the assault. While the Beys begin barraging each-other once more, vortexes of winds follow through with every collision, as announced by Blader Gai. After a few more attacks, Zyro plans to gain impending speed for Ifrit and allows Ifrit to circle the Stadium to do so. To counter Zyro's attempt, Sakyo has Dragoon circle the Stadium but spins in a path that is greater than that of Ifrit's. With the Right-Spin Ifrit gaining speed, the Left-Spin Dragoon has foiled its plan as Dragoon begins interfering with Ifrit's circle-spin with hits, thus disrupting it and keeping it off of balance. As a result, the two forces of the two Beys' speeding has caused the Zero-G Stadium to stay flat and remove the constant swaying, something noticed by Gai.

        "Blader Gai gives a recap of the recent match between Zyro and Sakyo, the resulting of this first match of the semi-finals to ultimately have Zyro advance to the finals as the second and last match of the semi-finals is about to commence. As this happens, Team Garcia are spectating the soon-to-be match as their motives and expectations for Kira are soon, underway. Shinobu will be pitted against Kira in order to determine who shall advance to the finals and battle Zero to be crowned the champion of Neo Battle Bladers and essentially, the No. 1 Blader in Japan. As this occurs, the audience remains cheering in excitement as the two opponents walk to the Zero-G Stadium with Shinobu's friends cheering him on with confidence. Entering the platforms, they are raised up to prepare for their match as immediately, Shinobu announces to Kira how he has conducted intense training and has been prepared to defeat Berserker Behemoth. Kira however, merely smirks and scoffs at this when he tells Shinobu that he had no need to wield Behemoth anymore, throwing it away in search of something \"more\". As a solution, Kira was able to receive what he was aspiring for in the form of Gladiator Bahamut. Alarming everyone in an instant including Team Garcia, each remains in shock and distraught by this unexpected debut of a new Beyblade. Kira further announces that his new Beyblade is something not to be underestimated and that Shinobu's plan to counter Behemoth's moves has now failed; forcing Shinobu to cope with the advent of a new Bey. Shinobu, irritated by this, starts of \"3... 2... 1... Let It Rip!\" as he and Kira launch their Beyblades for battle. Ninja Salamander lands in the arena to combat Bahamut yet in an instant, Bahamut shows full-throttle already when it brings Salamander to leap off the Stadium floor. Surprised, Shinobu commands Salamander to return safely but only to face the same attack and is thrown out into the air. Quite irritated and surprised, Shinobu tries to find a way to counter this and succeeds when he uses Salamander to offer Bahamut a hit and then vanish in thin air to appear again and so forth. Relying on the stealth and security of the shinobi, Shinobu shows continuous repeats in his strategy, which is something that merely amuses Kira. While Salamander is delivering hits and disappearances to its opponent, Mal precisely studies these two Beyblades, seeing the wholesome power that Bahamut has the potential to unlock. Mal is quite afraid for Shinobu, the new Bey challenges her data to make it impossible in order to deduce what the outcome would be like. Kite, Eight and Ren are as well and continue watching their friend in combat. Kira, deciding that he has had enough to witness the barrages of hits Salamander is delivering, counters it by using the early strategy of smacking Salamander with enough force to be escalated into the air. Shocked, Shinobu already comprehends that if he leaves this to continue any further, he will not be able to win. Taking a stance with his force, Shinobu commands Salamander to stand its ground and use his special move, Soul Ring Assault. Despite this, Bahamut is shown to be at the center of the BeyStadium in perfect spin as the mist clear, something that alarms Shinobu. Kira tells Shinobu that the reason why Bahamut did not receive a Stadium-Out was because of its spin track SP230, thus destroying yet another one of Shinobu's strategies. In quick response, Kira decides to show Shinobu the true power that Bahamut holds when the Stadium starts shaking a bid more rapid than usual. Sounds of earthquakes are nearby, rumbling in enormous roars as Gladiator Bahamut instantly assaults Shinobi Salamander. Montages of hard-hitting smacks bring Salamander to great lengths as various pieces of metal are torn off by Bahamdia. Shinobu just cries in fear as he constantly yells \"Salamander!\", but is helpless when his own Beyblade is undergoing destruction by Gladiator Bahamut. Hit after hit, Salamander is helpless and has no such way of survival when Bahamut returns to deliver another powerful, ballistic punch that rips even more bits and chips of metal off of Salamander. Filled with enough fear, Shinobu decides that he has witnessed enough and plans to reenact Zyro's strategy of defeating Sakyo; the bonds that are shared between friends. Immediately, the Scorching Salamander returns from a potential KO to dive back into the BeyStadium and unleash another attack that hopefully, shall defeat Bahamut once and for all. Trails of blazes follow suit into the Bahamut but Kira cancels this out as Gladiator Bahamut stands out to reveal who is the true titan. Powerful, gushes of high, intensive winds follow through as they cancel out every flame when simultaneous rumbling roars of quakes are built upon when pieces of rocks come flying out of the ground. The two platforms that the Bladers are standing on becomes shaking intensively, showing complete potential of what Kira is about to unleash next. Without hesitation, Kira in an instant, brings a powerful fist of a darkness-isnpired aura that pounds on the outcome of the battle when the Bahamut stands front-and-centre to unleah its special move, Gladiator Demolition. As the mist clears, all is seen but a terrible sight. The Zero-G Stadium, carefully created and built from the ground-up to withstand Zero-G battles is nothing but broken pieces of metal that are shattered on the ground; very reminiscent of Zyro and Sakyo's fight. An almighty Gladiator Bahamut is still left in perfect spin-rotation, even after the destruction that it unleashed. Ninja Salamander has been severely damaged to a fine degree as well as its owner being thrown back in damage due to the fight. Zyro intended to help check if his friend was okay, but was set back due to the humungous explosion. Kira jumps off the BeyStadium to confront a seriously hurt Shinobu being confronted by his friend, Zyro. Kira tells Zyro of how he is looking forward to facing him in the finals, and warns Zyro of the power that he is about to face with Bahamut. Zyro, just irritated, shows an angered look at Kira, forced to soon face what Shinobu had to in this battle.",

Kira further announces that his new Beyblade is something not to be underestimated and that Shinobu's plan to counter Behemoth's moves has now failed; forcing Shinobu to cope with the advent of a new Bey. Shinobu, irritated by this, starts of \"3... 2... 1... Let It Rip!\" as he and Kira launch their Beyblades for battle. Ninja Salamander lands in the arena to combat Bahamut yet in an instant, Bahamut shows full-throttle already when it brings Salamander to leap off the Stadium floor. Surprised, Shinobu commands Salamander to return safely but only to face the same attack and is thrown out into the air. Quite irritated and surprised, Shinobu tries to find a way to counter this and succeeds when he uses Salamander to offer Bahamut a hit and then vanish in thin air to appear again and so forth. Relying on the stealth and security of the shinobi, Shinobu shows continuous repeats in his strategy, which is something that merely amuses Kira. While Salamander is delivering hits and disappearances to its opponent, Mal precisely studies these two Beyblades, seeing the wholesome power that Bahamut has the potential to unlock. Mal is quite afraid for Shinobu, the new Bey challenges her data to make it impossible in order to deduce what the outcome would be like. Kite, Eight and Ren are as well and continue watching their friend in combat. Kira, deciding that he has had enough to witness the barrages of hits Salamander is delivering, counters it by using the early strategy of smacking Salamander with enough force to be escalated into the air. Shocked, Shinobu already comprehends that if he leaves this to continue any further, he will not be able to win. Taking a stance with his force, Shinobu commands Salamander to stand its ground and use his special move, Soul Ring Assault. Despite this, Bahamut is shown to be at the center of the BeyStadium in perfect spin as the mist clear, something that alarms Shinobu. Kira tells Shinobu that the reason why Bahamut did not receive a Stadium-Out was because of its spin track SP230, thus destroying yet another one of Shinobu's strategies. In quick response, Kira decides to show Shinobu the true power that Bahamut holds when the Stadium starts shaking a bid more rapid than usual. Sounds of earthquakes are nearby, rumbling in enormous roars as Gladiator Bahamut instantly assaults Shinobi Salamander. Montages of hard-hitting smacks bring Salamander to great lengths as various pieces of metal are torn off by Bahamdia. Shinobu just cries in fear as he constantly yells \"Salamander!\", but is helpless when his own Beyblade is undergoing destruction by Gladiator Bahamut. Hit after hit, Salamander is helpless and has no such way of survival when Bahamut returns to deliver another powerful, ballistic punch that rips even more bits and chips of metal off of Salamander. Filled with enough fear, Shinobu decides that he has witnessed enough and plans to reenact Zyro's strategy of defeating Sakyo; the bonds that are shared between friends. Immediately, the Scorching Salamander returns from a potential KO to dive back into the BeyStadium and unleash another attack that hopefully, shall defeat Bahamut once and for all. Trails of blazes follow suit into the Bahamut but Kira cancels this out as Gladiator Bahamut stands out to reveal who is the true titan. Powerful, gushes of high, intensive winds follow through as they cancel out every flame when simultaneous rumbling roars of quakes are built upon when pieces of rocks come flying out of the ground. The two platforms that the Bladers are standing on becomes shaking intensively, showing complete potential of what Kira is about to unleash next. Without hesitation, Kira in an instant, brings a powerful fist of a darkness-isnpired aura that pounds on the outcome of the battle when the Bahamut stands front-and-centre to unleah its special move, Gladiator Demolition. As the mist clears, all is seen but a terrible sight. The Zero-G Stadium, carefully created and built from the ground-up to withstand Zero-G battles is nothing but broken pieces of metal that are shattered on the ground; very reminiscent of Zyro and Sakyo's fight. An almighty Gladiator Bahamut is still left in perfect spin-rotation, even after the destruction that it unleashed. Ninja Salamander has been severely damaged to a fine degree as well as its owner being thrown back in damage due to the fight. Zyro intended to help check if his friend was okay, but was set back due to the humungous explosion. Kira jumps off the BeyStadium to confront a seriously hurt Shinobu being confronted by his friend, Zyro. Kira tells Zyro of how he is looking forward to facing him in the finals, and warns Zyro of the power that he is about to face with Bahamut. Zyro, just irritated, shows an angered look at Kira, forced to soon face what Shinobu had to in this battle."

        "Blader Gai offers another recap in the form of the recent match between Shinobu and Kira which resulted in not only wrecking the whole Zero-G Stadium, but Kira winning with his unexpected but new beyblade, Gladiator Bahamut. This allowed Kira to advance to the finals of the tournament in which he will face off with the Blader of Fire, Zyro of whom, was able to advance upon defeating Sakyo. The match is expected to be held the next day as blimps fly throughout Metal Bey City to inform everyone of this historic event. A certain individual however, catches the glimpse of Gai as he stares in content to the announcement. Over at DNA however, Team Garcias could be less than excited when they have called for a confrontation with their most powerful member, Kira Hayama. Upon his recent victory over the Invincible Salamander, Kira happened to wield a Beyblade other than Berserker Behemoth: the Dragon-Killer and the strongest Stamina-Type in existence. When Kira used a different Bey in the form of Bahamut, it shocked them as to concern as to why Kira was not using it and demanded a reason why. Kira, acknowledging Begirados, scoffs and smirks at it as he explains to them that he threw Begirados away. Kira was in search for something \"more\", something that offered something else than just being the best in Stamina, something that would satisfy his needs. The Garcias however are shocked to hear these words coming out from Kira, knowing that it had always been planned for Kira to use Berserker Behemoth and nothing else, and the arrival of a new Bey completely destroys their had-been plan; even Yoshio and Merci side with Kira, something that not only alarms the Garcias but commands the remaining DNA Bladers to assault Kira. Spike, Genj\u016br\u014d, and Captain Arrow subsequently appear to launch Thief Girago, Bandit Genbu, and Archer Wyvern at Kira. Despite this sudden three versus one match, Kira is not shocked when he launches out Gladiator Bahamut with almost no skill that allows this one Bey to single-handily oppress the three. When Girago, Genbu, and Wyvern fall down and lose-spin, their three owners are thrown back in response to the collision with Team Garcias thrown back as well. The God returns to Kira's hands as Argo is very frustrated and irritated at what Kira has done to them, something that Kira does not feel remorse for as he is prepared for the climax of Neo Battle Bladers. Elsewhere, Tsubasa and Madoka study Gladiator Bahamut's parts at the WBBA, very concerned over the power that it was holding when it wreaked havoc upon Shinobu and Ninja Salamander. They are then given a video-call by Mal via her laptop to tell them about the effects of the battle on Shinobu. After the demolition of the Zero-G Stadium, Shinobu fell off and was heavily harmed. He had to be hospitalized which he is right at the moment and things do not seem to be looking very good for him. Shocked by this, Tsubasa and Madoka share their condolences toward Shinobu as Mal does the same, she also does announce at how Zyro has left in anger to a shipyard, enraged over Kira's win over Shinobu. As well as alarming them, Tsubasa holds his dear wishes that Zyro is doing alright over it and the video-call subsequently ends. At the shipyard however, Zyro is shown in one of the most enraged moments of his life. Undergoing extensive and harsher training than the wrecking ball with Benkei, Zyro has his Samurai Ifrit to bring full-blown collisions to various metal obstructions left on the shipyard. With every blow and collision that Ifrit inflicts, Zyro only blooms with a hated anger when his temper becomes too high that the scorching aura of him rages to a very powerful point. As Zyro continues his marathon of anger, the Unabara brothers watch in contempt and their utter-most concern for their friend. They see how Zyro is pushing himself to the limits in order to defeat Kira and even the thought of Kira adds much, more anger to Zyro that he cannot control it and can only let it out with this collision-course he is driving. With much, more clashes that Ifrit undergoes, Zyro goes full-throttle on the next one when Samurai Ifrit heads toward the next objective but an outside force clashes in with the bey to bring about another collision. Quickly alarmed, Zero seems to have calmed down his forceful rage when his Ifrit returns to his hand and he finds an individual standing at the top of a cliff. Shocked, Zyro sees the individual jump off and land swiftly on the ground, bringing the return of the great Blader, the Blader of the Season of Autumn, the No. 1 Blader in the World: Gingka Hagane. Gingka walks up to Zyro when he tells him of how he was spectating Zyro's match and discovers at how is he going up against Kira in the finals of Neo Battle Bladers, also introducing his beyblade, the God in the form of Samurai Pegasus. While Zyro is just speechless at the thought of actually talking to his idol, Gingka also tells him that he remembers giving Zyro his beyblade, Samurai Ifrit when he was a young boy, which also causes Zero to remember. Gingka declares that he finds Zyro to be a very powerful opponent and that he would like to duel him so that he could receive more training prior to his upcoming match. Accepting this, Zyro brings Gingka to a hole obstruction that he made in the shipyard in response to his anger over Kira's win against Shinobu. At the count of \"Let It Rip!\", Zyro's Samurai Ifrit is launched to combat Gingka's Samurai Pegasus. When the beyblades make contact, immediate explosions arise in response to much of the surprise at Zyro. Knowing to give it his all, Zero has his Ifrit continue to battle when more explosions appear. As much of the mist clears, he finds that Ifrit and Pegasus have been pushed to a barrier; both showing equally powerful force which does not allow either beyblade to move past one-another. As the Beys continue fighting, with Zyro's huge force of power, the Beys bring about another explosions that this time, throws back Zyro after the collision to have him knocked out. Zyro finds himself brought to the middle of a galaxy as he is floating and meets Gingka there as well. Zyro is entranced at the moment, the beauty of it all and how he is actually battling his idol. With the red aura that Samurai Ifrit leaves out, and the blue aura that Samurai Pegasus leaves out, the two auras clash each-other in combat that brings forceful blows to each-other. Gingka tells Zyro that he admires Zyro's ambition to not be the No. 1 Blader in the World, but to care for his friends and do what is right and defeat Kira. With Zyro's friends, Shinobu, Mal, Eight, Kite, Ren, Takanosuke and Sakyo; all these people that Zyro has met throughout his life, he shares a bond with them that allows him to reach anything. Gingka tells Zyro that he always hated to lose, but the bonds that he shared with his own friends allows him to go past the limits and reach it. Amazed by this, the two beyblades continue the clash when Gingka announces to Zyro that he shall give Zero all of his \"power\" so that he may win against Kira the next day. Surprised, Zyro finds the colourful bonds speeding from Gingka and heading toward Zyro. As the bonds continue to come, the entranced moment ends. Zyro finds himself awake and how the dusk of night has turned to day. He finds that Gingka has disappeared and takes a look at Ifrit. He stands up to find a blimp of Gai's announcement of the final match between he and Kira. Zyro is now ready.",

Gingka tells Zyro that he admires Zyro's ambition to not be the No. 1 Blader in the World, but to care for his friends and do what is right and defeat Kira. With Zyro's friends, Shinobu, Mal, Eight, Kite, Ren, Takanosuke and Sakyo; all these people that Zyro has met throughout his life, he shares a bond with them that allows him to reach anything. Gingka tells Zyro that he always hated to lose, but the bonds that he shared with his own friends allows him to go past the limits and reach it. Amazed by this, the two beyblades continue the clash when Gingka announces to Zyro that he shall give Zero all of his \"power\" so that he may win against Kira the next day. Surprised, Zyro finds the colourful bonds speeding from Gingka and heading toward Zyro. As the bonds continue to come, the entranced moment ends. Zyro finds himself awake and how the dusk of night has turned to day. He finds that Gingka has disappeared and takes a look at Ifrit. He stands up to find a blimp of Gai's announcement of the final match between he and Kira. Zyro is now ready."

        "Commencing with another recap by Blader Gai, the finals of Neo Battle Bladers are about to begin. Zyro Kurogane, the Blader of Fire, will be facing off against Kira Hayama, the Killing Mountain-Breaker. News of Blader Gai's words are shown throughout all of Metal Bey City, informing everyone of the extraordinary match that has almost arrived. Benkei hears the news along with an injured Shinobu, while Mal and Ren hear as well. Subsequently, they are met by a sprinting Zyro apologizing for the delay in his arrival; assuring them that he is ready as he ever be for the battle. Meanwhile, Kira is on his way to his upcoming match whilst accompanied by Yoshio. As they go, they exchange a talk where Yoshio asks if Kira is ready for his battle and acknowledges how Zyro will be a force as his opponent. Kira however, does not worry as he is quite calm and confident that he can and will defeat Zyro; suggested by their past Synchrom battle after Kira hacked the WBBA just before Neo Battle Bladers was announced. Yoshio hears Kira's words and accepts this as they at last, arrive to the tournament. Elsewhere however, are the heads of DNA, Team Gracia, trapped in a room. After the betrayal of their two most powerful Bladers, they tapped the Garcias in one of their headquarters' rooms, not able to leave due to a locked door in their way. As they pester and argue over what their bladers has done, Merci begins a chat with them over the query. As uncaring and sarcastic as Merci is, Merci shows no remorse or compassion over their \"reprogrammers\", stating that Kira will go off to continue in his fight against Zyro with Gladiator Bahamut, not Berserker Behemoth. Not long after, Zyro and Kira have finally arrived to their highly anticipated showdown in Neo Battle Bladers, the final fight that will decide the No. 1 Blader in Japan. As they walk toward their respective Zero-G platforms, Blader Gai announces how this battle is almost ready to begin. Zero has a short reminiscing over the sight he had seen yesterday, Gingka Hagane. This opportunity allowed Gingka to give Zyro confidence and a renewed reassurance to defeat Kira. Gingka's speech about the Blader's Spirit definitely helped Zyro and now is his time to prove it. Kira then goes to talk with Zyro for their match, stating that he is impressed by Zyro's skills and is glad to be fighting him once more, knowing that this will be a sight to see. Zero however, still irritated for what Kira has done, ignores this as he and Kira countdown to \"Let It Rip!\" and launch out their Beyblades. Samurai Ifrit throws down with Gladiator Bahamut when their first collision causes an enormous explosion to emerge in a similar manner to Kira's fight with Shinobu. The beys continue to clash and attack one-another, with the grinding of the metal slowly offering more blows and hits as Ifrit and Bahamut battle. Zero is temporarily concerned when he discovers how powerful the Gladiator Bahamut is for himself; seeing as how the bey continues to wipe the floor with Ifrit with a rampage of assaults. This fades away when Zyro is able to make an unexpected move by having Ifrit first doge one of Bahamdia's planned attacks. Kira, impressed yet surprised, sees how Zyro continues this strategy, hoping to use this to victory. With more dodges that can be spectated, Zyro decides to bring with it his special move, Burning Uppercut.

Kira is very impressed by Zyro's tactics in battle, showing that he has changed from their previous fight. Despite this, Kira decides to become more serious in this battle when he has his bey go full-throttle on the next attack.

        "The last match of Neo Battle Bladers pits the fateful brawl between Zyro and Kira. As the battle continues, Zyro is caught off by surprise from the tremendous power of Kira's Gladiator Bahamut. Bahamut is showing powerful moves against Zyro's Samurai Ifrit. As the audience looks in with awe and cheer, they watch every second of this enticing battle. As the two Beyblades continue to clash in an epic combat, Zyro is frustrated when Bahamut is showing incredible power that seems to become too much for Ifrit to handle. As the Zero-G Stadium continues to sway and rock at every second, and combined with the powerful winds that were created and emitted by Bahamdia, it seems as if Zyro does not have a way to get out of this predicament. It only gets worse when Kira builds up the moment to use his special move, Gladiator Demolition. Just like in Kira's battle with Shinobu, the beast of Gladiator Bahamut returns to wreak havoc once again on his opponent and the Zero-G Stadium. A heavy rocking causes incredible force to occur to the Zero-G Stadium with the bladers' platforms as well. Zyro attempts to hold on to the difficult shaking of the destruction when smoke created by explosions escape into the air. The shaking and thrusting of the demolition is like that of an earthquake, and an explosion covers the view-point to make it impossible to decipher what is the outcome. As a result, Mal, Kite, Eight, and Ren stand from their seats in fear in response to Kira's special move. Not wanting to see their friend hurt or lose the battle, they are relived because once the smoke clears, they find Gladiator Bahamdia spinning with Samurai Ifrit. Kira is shocked by this as well, seeing as how nobody could survive what is believed to be the ultimate special move in history, even if Shinobu was the only one to witness it, first-hand. Although he is alarmed, Kira does not hesitate to have Bahamut continue to attack Samurai Ifrit of which, in turn, holds its ground from the commands of its owner, Zyro. Zyro tries his best to survive every hit from, Bahamut, especially when the whole Zero-G Stadium is wrecked to a complete re-haul, leaving only the same status of destructive nature from Shinobu's last match. Bahamut and Ifrit continue to duke it out in the BeyStadium, giving it their all as they fight to their maximum. Zyro knows that he cannot give up, not now, especially when he was able to survive through Kira'a assault with Bahamut. Zyro's hope and reassurance still remains, even when Bahamut still seems to have the upper hand and continues to wipe the floor with Ifrit, knocking it into the air with all of its might; Ifrit is helpless. Just to make matters worse, Kira uses Gladiator Demolition again in order to finish the match off, once and for all. When the Beast of Gladiator Bahamut returns, it rushes into Samurai Ifrit and in an instant, smacks it high-up into the air, thrown away into the clouds. The whole audience and every spectator is shocked. While the match is not over yet, the odds seem to be against Zyro. Zyro does not care at all. Zyro remembers that fateful encounter that he had with the great blader, Gingka Hagane, yesterday. From their match that took them to the cosmos, the preach of the blader's spirit still remained. A force that does not depend on the strength of the beyblade itself, but the heart and soul of its Blader. The bonds of friendship empower these forces, causing entrusted emotions to shine bright. Zyro holds bonds that are kept with his best friends, a lesson that was taught to him by Gingka. Zyro takes a stance to ignore what everyone else and Kira thinks about the outcome and possibility of Zyro's loss in this battle. Zyro uses Gingka's speech to preach on the powerful force that is the blader's spirit. Depending on the bonds that one holds with their friends, it allows them to defy the odds and go beyond what could not be beyond. It is the scared ideal that helps bladers in their most difficult of obstacles, just to let them reach what could not be. Samurai Ifrit is revealed to be rushing down from its throw by the hands of Gladiator Bahamut, ready to return the favour in an epic clash of mass proportions. Only this time Samurai Ifrit is not alone. The beasts of Ninja Salamander, Thief Phoenix, Pirate Orochi, and Guardian Leviathan team-up with their friend to create a new special move. This bond creates the ultimate special move, Burning Tornado Fire, and it goes far beyond of Gladiator Demolition. When Kira commands Gladiator Bahamut to create a shield of dark energy to protect it, it is still no nothing when Samurai Ifrit makes contact with Bahamut and creates one of the biggest explosions ever known. The audience shields themselves from the force of the battle, as Zyro and Kira continue their final battle. When the explosion causes the mist to disappear, Samurai Ifrit is grinding at the top on Gladiator Bahamut, causing it to stop spinning. Zyro is the champion of Neo Battle Bladers and becomes the new \"No. 1 Blader in Japan\". When a moment of silence appears, the audience bursts out in total joy when Blader Gai announces the news. Kira smacks his fist into the ground in anger, frustrated by the result but he walks away with Yoshio. Shinobu had watched the whole scene as well, being carried by Benkei to see Zyro in the fight. Zyro's friends later run towards Zyro to congratulate him on his victory. As Mal hugs Zyro, everyone rejoices in glee and happiness with Zyro winning. Nobody could have been happier in this moment, but Zyro takes a look back at Kira and dashes towards him. Zyro offers Kira the chance to become friends, especially after the epic battle that was taken between them; not wanting their to be any loose ties between the two. Despite this, Kira's attitude and true colours still show when he rejects Zyro's statement and walks away with Yoshio. While disappointing and confusing Zyro at the same time, he is approached by his friends to tell him not to worry about it, anyway. Tsubasa, the head of the WBBA even goes on to announce the outcome with Zyro as the new victor; whilst also letting out details about a new \"world championship\" to take place, soon after. Zyro is sure that he and his friends will embark together on a world championship, should they. As time passes from the final battle, things start to change. Sakyo and Takanosuke have left as spectators to do some training with their Beyblades in preparation for the next world championship, hoping to take part in it. Benkei later starts a new \"training program\", due to his success of training of Zyro who as a result, became the No. 1 Blader in Japan. Two Benkei's newest recruits are Gen and Akuya who are lifting weight with buckets. Zyro and Shinobu are at Bey Park and the two are about to battle. The two take a stance to yell out the legendary chant, about to launch Samurai Ifrit and Ninja Salamander. \"3... 2... 1...Let It Rip!\".",

A heavy rocking causes incredible force to occur to the Zero-G Stadium with the bladers' platforms as well. Zyro attempts to hold on to the difficult shaking of the destruction when smoke created by explosions escape into the air. The shaking and thrusting of the demolition is like that of an earthquake, and an explosion covers the view-point to make it impossible to decipher what is the outcome. As a result, Mal, Kite, Eight, and Ren stand from their seats in fear in response to Kira's special move. Not wanting to see their friend hurt or lose the battle, they are relived because once the smoke clears, they find Gladiator Bahamdia spinning with Samurai Ifrit. Kira is shocked by this as well, seeing as how nobody could survive what is believed to be the ultimate special move in history, even if Shinobu was the only one to witness it, first-hand. Although he is alarmed, Kira does not hesitate to have Bahamut continue to attack Samurai Ifrit of which, in turn, holds its ground from the commands of its owner, Zyro. Zyro tries his best to survive every hit from, Bahamut, especially when the whole Zero-G Stadium is wrecked to a complete re-haul, leaving only the same status of destructive nature from Shinobu's last match. Bahamut and Ifrit continue to duke it out in the BeyStadium, giving it their all as they fight to their maximum. Zyro knows that he cannot give up, not now, especially when he was able to survive through Kira'a assault with Bahamut. Zyro's hope and reassurance still remains, even when Bahamut still seems to have the upper hand and continues to wipe the floor with Ifrit, knocking it into the air with all of its might; Ifrit is helpless. Just to make matters worse, Kira uses Gladiator Demolition again in order to finish the match off, once and for all. When the Beast of Gladiator Bahamut returns, it rushes into Samurai Ifrit and in an instant, smacks it high-up into the air, thrown away into the clouds. The whole audience and every spectator is shocked. While the match is not over yet, the odds seem to be against Zyro. Zyro does not care at all. Zyro remembers that fateful encounter that he had with the great blader, Gingka Hagane, yesterday. From their match that took them to the cosmos, the preach of the blader's spirit still remained. A force that does not depend on the strength of the beyblade itself, but the heart and soul of its Blader. The bonds of friendship empower these forces, causing entrusted emotions to shine bright. Zyro holds bonds that are kept with his best friends, a lesson that was taught to him by Gingka. Zyro takes a stance to ignore what everyone else and Kira thinks about the outcome and possibility of Zyro's loss in this battle. Zyro uses Gingka's speech to preach on the powerful force that is the blader's spirit. Depending on the bonds that one holds with their friends, it allows them to defy the odds and go beyond what could not be beyond. It is the scared ideal that helps bladers in their most difficult of obstacles, just to let them reach what could not be. Samurai Ifrit is revealed to be rushing down from its throw by the hands of Gladiator Bahamut, ready to return the favour in an epic clash of mass proportions. Only this time Samurai Ifrit is not alone. The beasts of Ninja Salamander, Thief Phoenix, Pirate Orochi, and Guardian Leviathan team-up with their friend to create a new special move. This bond creates the ultimate special move, Burning Tornado Fire, and it goes far beyond of Gladiator Demolition. When Kira commands Gladiator Bahamut to create a shield of dark energy to protect it, it is still no nothing when Samurai Ifrit makes contact with Bahamut and creates one of the biggest explosions ever known. The audience shields themselves from the force of the battle, as Zyro and Kira continue their final battle. When the explosion causes the mist to disappear, Samurai Ifrit is grinding at the top on Gladiator Bahamut, causing it to stop spinning. Zyro is the champion of Neo Battle Bladers and becomes the new \"No. 1 Blader in Japan\". When a moment of silence appears, the audience bursts out in total joy when Blader Gai announces the news. Kira smacks his fist into the ground in anger, frustrated by the result but he walks away with Yoshio. Shinobu had watched the whole scene as well, being carried by Benkei to see Zyro in the fight. Zyro's friends later run towards Zyro to congratulate him on his victory. As Mal hugs Zyro, everyone rejoices in glee and happiness with Zyro winning. Nobody could have been happier in this moment, but Zyro takes a look back at Kira and dashes towards him. Zyro offers Kira the chance to become friends, especially after the epic battle that was taken between them; not wanting their to be any loose ties between the two. Despite this, Kira's attitude and true colours still show when he rejects Zyro's statement and walks away with Yoshio. While disappointing and confusing Zyro at the same time, he is approached by his friends to tell him not to worry about it, anyway. Tsubasa, the head of the WBBA even goes on to announce the outcome with Zyro as the new victor; whilst also letting out details about a new \"world championship\" to take place, soon after. Zyro is sure that he and his friends will embark together on a world championship, should they. As time passes from the final battle, things start to change. Sakyo and Takanosuke have left as spectators to do some training with their Beyblades in preparation for the next world championship, hoping to take part in it. Benkei later starts a new \"training program\", due to his success of training of Zyro who as a result, became the No. 1 Blader in Japan. Two Benkei's newest recruits are Gen and Akuya who are lifting weight with buckets. Zyro and Shinobu are at Bey Park and the two are about to battle. The two take a stance to yell out the legendary chant, about to launch Samurai Ifrit and Ninja Salamander. \"3... 2... 1...Let It Rip!\".",
        "The last match of Neo Battle Bladers pits the fateful brawl between Zyro and Kira. As the battle continues, Zyro is caught off by surprise from the tremendous power of Kira's Gladiator Bahamut. Bahamut is showing powerful moves against Zyro's Samurai Ifrit. As the audience looks in with awe and cheer, they watch every second of this enticing battle. As the two Beyblades continue to clash in an epic combat, Zyro is frustrated when Bahamut is showing incredible power that seems to become too much for Ifrit to handle. As the Zero-G Stadium continues to sway and rock at every second, and combined with the powerful winds that were created and emitted by Bahamdia, it seems as if Zyro does not have a way to get out of this predicament. It only gets worse when Kira builds up the moment to use his special move, Gladiator Demolition. Just like in Kira's battle with Shinobu, the beast of Gladiator Bahamut returns to wreak havoc once again on his opponent and the Zero-G Stadium.

        "During a dark and stormy night, Gingka is walking past, until he finds a young boy crying behind a big rock. He tells Gingka about his \"problem\" and he seems to be holding a Zero-G Launcher Grip, revealing that he is a Blader. Gingka tries to help the Blader find his \"Bey\" and they go into an abandoned temple. Lightning then strikes, scaring the small boy, and Gingka begins to explore the temple in search of the boy's Beyblade. As Gingka walks by, he notices a mysterious Beyblade already spinning. Gingka assumes there is some Blader attempting to challenge him, but as he attempts to grab his Samurai Pegasus, it is gone. The Legendary Blader suddenly hears a voice of laughter, it is none other than the little boy himself, revealing how he stole Gingka's Bey! Gingka is quick to react, but even before he could make a single step, the temple ground breaks and he falls into unknown whereabouts. The boy laughs about his completed plan in snagging Samurai Pegasus. Meanwhile in Metal Bey City, Blader Gai announces how the second Beyblade World Championships has begun global qualifying tournaments; many incredible battles happening every second. Zyro practices with Samurai Ifrit knocking down opponents with the power of its special move, Burning Upper. In the audience, Benkei and the others are surprised that after Neo Battle Bladers, Zyro is still growing and becoming stronger day by day. Zyro asks the audience if they would like to challenge the Blader of Fire, and of course everyone is excited. Blader Gai then states how that three of the supreme bladers, Zyro, Shinobu, and Kite are apparently in the top three, while Ren wants to challenge them, including Eight. Zyro begins to battle Ren in a battle of flames and meanwhile, the little boy from earlier seems to be lurking in Metal Bey City. Later, Zyro and Co. eat at Bull Burger as Zyro enjoys his delicious burger and everyone else is talking about their awesome Beybattles. A storm appears outside, where two Bladers spring in an effort to avoid the rain. Soon enough, they stumble upon an unknown bey and the young boy who stole Samurai Pegasus starts a fight with those two; another beybattle begins. Despite this, the two boys' beyblades are no match for it. The next day, Ren and Eight are hurrying quickly for a chance to fight the mighty Zyro, Kite and Shinobu but unfortunately other bladers made it before them. Many spectators are happily witnessing the epic fights between the two fierce bladers, but then an explosion occurs near the door. Yoshio enters with a sinister look, he brings the remaining DNA laders with him. Everyone is alarmed, including Kite, who assumed DNA was done for good. Yoshio and the other DNA bladers begin trashing the precious arena and Stadium, while the other bladers are scared and frightened. Zyro and Shinobu are elsewhere at Bull Burger but Maru runs, informing Zyro that DNA has returned, and are stronger than ever. The two Fire Bladers are confused and head to BeyPark to protect it from the vile bladers. Back at BeyPark, it is totally trashed and Ren and Eight are tired of sitting around, so they prepare to launch their beys, but a voice can be heard somewhere. A young boy who was the one from earlier, jumps onto Yoshio's head. He reveals himself as a DNA member, Xiao. He subsequently challenges the Sea Blader, Kite to a battle and the latter accepts, believing he will school the youngling. Yet another fearsome fight has begun, with Kite's Guardian Leviathan 160SB battling a mysterious Tiger beyblade. Kite pushes his strength to demolish this unknown DNA bey, but every attack he makes, the beyblade continues spin; not affected at all. Xiao laughs and tells Kite that his pathetic attacks cannot give a scratch to his bey at all, so he unleashes an ultimate Special Move. His beyblade's Spirit is unleashed, the White Tiger of the West; Byakko, and it shoots out blue lightning which shockingly splits the Cyclone Stadium in quarters. Everyone is amazed at this Tiger bey's power whilst Shinobu and Zyro attempt to confront Yoshio, believing they shall stop DNA for good, this time. Meanwhile in the DNA headquarters, Kira is seen as DNA's new leader, still possessing the Emperor of Ultimate Destruction, Gladiator Bahamut. He Synchromes it with the Samurai Pegasus which Xiao gifted him. Kira presents his newly ultimate beyblade, Pegasus Bahamut to Merci, who is pleased. Team Garcias appear again, seeming to have escaped from their prison, telling Kira how he was a fool to lock them up. Merci soon uses his mysterious electrical powers to electrocute the Garcias family, hurting them severely. Argo is very irritated at the ruthless Merci, threatening him but Merci tells them that they have lost their position as DNA's leaders and uses a unknown power source to blast a wave of electricity, and a familiar voice speaks, scaring the Garcias. The electricity begins forming a body shape, which later forms a figure very recognizable: Doji. Returning to his original state prior prior to when the Forbidden Bey took Doji's life energy approximately seven years ago. Doji maniacally laughs and tells the Garcias that he has returned and now with Kira's new and ultimate Synchrome Bey, DNA will conquer the world. Kira subsequently speaks and says the \"time\" has come.",

        "As DNA continues their assault on BeyPark, the local BeyPark personnel retaliate with their beyblades but are no match for the DNA-manufactured ones. As mist from the DNA's destructive force clears, Zyro and Co. find the DNA Bladers approaching and they standoff. Kira proclaims BeyPark's destruction and subsequently orders his fellow DNA workers to attack. Zyro and Co. enter the fray with Zyro battling Captain Arrow, Shinobu against Genj\u016bro and Kite versus Spike . Yoshio Bandit Golem causes an explosion which destroys a Cyclone Stadium while Arrow's Archer Wyvang crafts a tornado. All the DNA members pull the heavy guns with explosions and Special Moves launched left and right throughout BeyPark. However Shinobu's Ninja Salamander is strong enough to knock back Spike's Thief Girago, landing in Wyvang's tornado and sent flying out of BeyPark. Ren's Thief Phoenix summons its firebird Spirit and brawls with Genj\u016bro's Bandit Genbu when the Black Tortoise of the North awakes. The two Beys grind one-another but Phoenix proves victorious and throws Genbu away for it to cease spinning. Ren then makes a remark about how this was her \"rematch\" from last time. Kite fights with Xiao as his Guardian Leviathan goes head on with Xiao's Berserker Byakko to bring in its White Tiger of the West Spirit. Unknowingly, Eight launches Pirate Orochi and grinds against the Tiger, helping his older brother who appreciates it. The Unabara Brothers double-team Xiao as the multi-headed snake and sea monster chomp away at the feline and hurl it towards a wall. Zyro however enters a Cyclone Stadiums versus Yoshio with Samurai Ifrit clashing with Bandit Golem. Zyro commands the samurai-armoured Ifrit to appear as it wages its blazing katana in defense against the green-armoured Golem. The fire demon wins this match and blows the rock monster away. Soon enough, the Breaking-Mountain Killer steps in to take Yoshio's platform in the Stadium. Zyro is determined to defeat Kira at all costs but everything changes once Kira announces his surprise. Rather than simply utilizing Gladiator Bahamut against him, Kira creates the ultimate Synchrome: Pegasus Bahamut. Everyone is alarmed by Kira's combination, especially considering how the Pegasus and R\u00b2F parts belong to the legendary, Gingka Hagane. Despite this, Zyro washes away his doubts to play two at this game as the Invincible Salamander lends Zyro the Salamander Warrior Wheel. With Salamander Ifrit at his side, the reptile and the demon fuse to create their Salamander Ifrit Spirit. Despite their best efforts, Kira summons the ultimate Spirit in the form of the Pegasus and Bahamut hybrid: Pegasus Bahamut. The beast knocks Salamander Ifrit with great ease off the Cyclone Stadium, only for it to land again and suffer multiple beatings by Pegasus Bahamut. The God Synchrome throws the Fire Synchrome into the Stadium walls, as if it were a ball. Although Salamander Ifrit was able to evade falling off, it cracked a hole spreading throughout the swaying Stadium, leaving it in pieces. Pegasus Bahamut returns for a final attack as it takes the skies and speeds back down into Salamander Ifrit - blowing up the Cyclone Stadium barriers and anything between. Pegasus Bahamut is seen grinding its opponent the same manner Zyro used in his Neo Battle Bladers fight with Kira. Zyro collapses in defeat, irritated at Kira's Synchrome. As Kira gloats from his win which leaves spectators scared and Maru, Benkei, Tsubasa and Madoka concered, a familiar voices is heard. That voice belongs to Doji, former Dark Nebula head who presumably died. While Zyro and Co. are confused, Doji reveals how he has survived. Approximately seven years ago during the Nemesis Crisis, Doji was believed to have faced death during Ryuga's battle against Rago where Ryuga used his L-Drago Destructor to have fallen to die. Doji however fell into water, only to be rescued by a defunct Dark Nebula submarine. Merci was his rescuer, hospitalizing him whilst also gathering Team Garcias in founding DNA. Doji's condition at the time had worsened and was impossible to revive him through normal means so an unorthodox method was chosen. This method was converting Doji into light energy which gifted him his original appearance prior to the Forbidden Bey-possessed Ryuga who took his life energy during the course of the original Battle Bladers. After speaking his revelation, Doji announced how DNA will go to top of the Beyblade world in controlling it. Upon this, DNA left BeyPark to return to their headquarters: the Dark Fortress. While everyone was concerned with DNA's intentions, Zyro was determined not to give up. He left the Cyclone Stadium platforms to retrieve their damaged Salamander Ifrit. Zyro announced to his friends that they would not give up and could not let DNA get away with this. With this encouragement, Zyro and Co. decided to go on a mission in leaving BeyPark and infiltrating the Dark Fortress to defeat DNA, once and for all.",

        "Zyro and Co. have left Neo Battle Bladers in search of DNA's headquarters: the Dark Fortress. After coming through some bushes, Eight trips from having his caught in a log. Upon getting back up, he asks Zyro to remind him why they need to do this. He refreshes their memories from their earlier meeting at the WBBA headquarters with Tsubasa, Madoka and Benkei. Tsubasa informed Zyro of how important it was to stopping DNA. The presence of evil in the Beyblade world has existed since Ryuga was possessed by the Forbidden Bey with Dark Nebula and Doji, to the Nemesis Crisis. Zyro understood how vital it is to preventing DNA from assuming control of the Beyblade world. After taking a look, the gang are shocked to find the towering DNA base. Struck with thunder, they are also fearful of what is to come ahead. Maru uses her laptop to webcam with the WBBA, showing them the base. Likewise, Tsubasa, Madoka and Benkei did not expect the location to resemble this and immediately express their concerns and speculate as to the safety of Zyro and the gang. Team Garcias with Doji, who already reside in the Dark Fortress use security cameras to spot Zyro and his friends already. As Zyro starts leading his friends into the stronghold, they suddenly find a person sitting on a rock before them. Aware of them, the person reveals that he is DNA's Dark Fortress guardian Karura, as well as a Blader wielding a Guardian Garudas. He tells them that it is his job to protect DNA's base at all cost and will not let Zyro and Co. pass. Irritated by his words, Zyro pulls out his Launcher intending to battle him, yet Kite declares he will instead and Eight does the same. Karura speaks out his duties as a guardian and his control over weather like thunder and wind which will prove difficult for Zyro's gang to overcome. Upon a thunderclap, Karura attaches Guardian Garudas to his Launcher Grip and rips it into battle while Kite does the same. Guardian Leviathan speeds toward Guardian Garudas and smashes it back. After landing, Karura commands Garudas to seemingly retreat which Leviathan chases but is struck by its opponent's surprise attack when Karura sends a blast of fire which throws the sea-dwelling Beyblade. Soon enough, Karura's Garudas barrages Guardian Leviathan with a forceful punch which also sends Leviathan flying with additional flames blowing it. Eight is concerned with the guard and launches Pirate Orochi to aid Kite and Leviathan. Despite his helpful effort, Karura summons raging winds which hinders the Beys. Zyro, Shinobu and Ren then agree they should be helping out as well and launch Samurai Ifrit, Ninja Salamander and Thief Phoenix, respectively. Karura is quick to react and sends Guardian Garudas to the sky in order to create another thunderclap which hits Ifrit, Salamander and Phoenix. Another thunder strike attacks Leviathan and Orochi, erupting lava takes Ifrit and Salamander while heavy wind blasts Phoenix. DNA happens to be watching the entire battle progress, catching Samurai Ifrit dashing towards Guardian Garudas only to be biting its dust when the latter races away with a flaming trail. Maru contacts Madoka again for assistance in the ongoing Beybattle which is appearing terrible for Zyro and the gang. Madoka is able to hypothesize that the extreme weather conditions may originate naturally and tells her student to scan the battlefield for any signs. Maru does so and exclaims in delight how her teacher was correct, and calls out to the Fire Bladers. She tells Zyro, Shinobu and Ren how there exist multiple points loaded with \"booby traps\" of sorts harboring fire traps. Karura knows where each one is and commands them to light off when desired, thus eliminating Karura's supposed \"unnatural\" powers. After hearing this, Kite laughs at how ridiculous Karura claims he is and intends to do justice to him and how a \"true\" guardian would act. The self-proclaimed Blader with the \"ultimate Defense-Type\" sends Guardian Leviathan to the guard's Bey and utilizes the wind currents to exterminate the flames, shocking the guard. Kite makes an announcement for his friends that he will finish off Karura and they should continue their Dark Fortress infiltration. The Fire Bladers accept this but Eight is worried, not wanting to leave his brother. Kite assures his sibling that he will return and it is important he helps out Zyro, Maru, Shinobu and Ren - to which Eight accepts and leaves with. Although Karura is aware of this and summons more wind currents to block them, Kite commands Leviathan to barrage Garudas which cancels the winds and allows them to bypass Karura - shocking DNA, as well. Karura and Kite's Beys go head-to-head with instant smashes both Beys deliver upon one-another. Karura is determined to be undefeated but Kite is even more. Karura presents more flames but even as the ashes go everywhere, Kite maintains under pressure. He tells Karura that he, himself is the true \"guardian\" and nothing can change that - with which, uses the flames to elevate Leviathan and bring in the wind currents to strike back down at Karura. Shocked by what Kite could achieve, the blow strikes him and knocks him back off his sitting rock - also depleting his Beyblade's spin entirely. Kite retracts Guardian Leviathan, with a victory in hand. Elsewhere, Zyro and Co. have successfully entered the Dark Fortress thanks to Kite's efforts. As they look around, they suddenly hear Doji's voice and subsequently the DNA Bladers reappear and take aim at Zyro's gang. Yoshio tells his opponents how they cannot reach Kira and they will stop them, but Zyro and Co. will not let that happen.",

Karura is quick to react and sends Guardian Garudas to the sky in order to create another thunderclap which hits Ifrit, Salamander and Phoenix. Another thunder strike attacks Leviathan and Orochi, erupting lava takes Ifrit and Salamander while heavy wind blasts Phoenix. DNA happens to be watching the entire battle progress, catching Samurai Ifrit dashing towards Guardian Garudas only to be biting its dust when the latter races away with a flaming trail. Maru contacts Madoka again for assistance in the ongoing Beybattle which is appearing terrible for Zyro and the gang. Madoka is able to hypothesize that the extreme weather conditions may originate naturally and tells her student to scan the battlefield for any signs. Maru does so and exclaims in delight how her teacher was correct, and calls out to the Fire Bladers. She tells Zyro, Shinobu and Ren how there exist multiple points loaded with \"booby traps\" of sorts harboring fire traps. Karura knows where each one is and commands them to light off when desired, thus eliminating Karura's supposed \"unnatural\" powers. After hearing this, Kite laughs at how ridiculous Karura claims he is and intends to do justice to him and how a \"true\" guardian would act. The self-proclaimed Blader with the \"ultimate Defense-Type\" sends Guardian Leviathan to the guard's Bey and utilizes the wind currents to exterminate the flames, shocking the guard. Kite makes an announcement for his friends that he will finish off Karura and they should continue their Dark Fortress infiltration. The Fire Bladers accept this but Eight is worried, not wanting to leave his brother. Kite assures his sibling that he will return and it is important he helps out Zyro, Maru, Shinobu and Ren - to which Eight accepts and leaves with. Although Karura is aware of this and summons more wind currents to block them, Kite commands Leviathan to barrage Garudas which cancels the winds and allows them to bypass Karura - shocking DNA, as well. Karura and Kite's Beys go head-to-head with instant smashes both Beys deliver upon one-another. Karura is determined to be undefeated but Kite is even more. Karura presents more flames but even as the ashes go everywhere, Kite maintains under pressure. He tells Karura that he, himself is the true \"guardian\" and nothing can change that - with which, uses the flames to elevate Leviathan and bring in the wind currents to strike back down at Karura. Shocked by what Kite could achieve, the blow strikes him and knocks him back off his sitting rock - also depleting his Beyblade's spin entirely. Kite retracts Guardian Leviathan, with a victory in hand. Elsewhere, Zyro and Co. have successfully entered the Dark Fortress thanks to Kite's efforts. As they look around, they suddenly hear Doji's voice and subsequently the DNA Bladers reappear and take aim at Zyro's gang. Yoshio tells his opponents how they cannot reach Kira and they will stop them, but Zyro and Co. will not let that happen.",
        "Zyro and Co. have left Neo Battle Bladers in search of DNA's headquarters: the Dark Fortress. After coming through some bushes, Eight trips from having his caught in a log. Upon getting back up, he asks Zyro to remind him why they need to do this. He refreshes their memories from their earlier meeting at the WBBA headquarters with Tsubasa, Madoka and Benkei. Tsubasa informed Zyro of how important it was to stopping DNA. The presence of evil in the Beyblade world has existed since Ryuga was possessed by the Forbidden Bey with Dark Nebula and Doji, to the Nemesis Crisis. Zyro understood how vital it is to preventing DNA from assuming control of the Beyblade world. After taking a look, the gang are shocked to find the towering DNA base. Struck with thunder, they are also fearful of what is to come ahead. Maru uses her laptop to webcam with the WBBA, showing them the base. Likewise, Tsubasa, Madoka and Benkei did not expect the location to resemble this and immediately express their concerns and speculate as to the safety of Zyro and the gang. Team Garcias with Doji, who already reside in the Dark Fortress use security cameras to spot Zyro and his friends already. As Zyro starts leading his friends into the stronghold, they suddenly find a person sitting on a rock before them. Aware of them, the person reveals that he is DNA's Dark Fortress guardian Karura, as well as a Blader wielding a Guardian Garudas. He tells them that it is his job to protect DNA's base at all cost and will not let Zyro and Co. pass. Irritated by his words, Zyro pulls out his Launcher intending to battle him, yet Kite declares he will instead and Eight does the same. Karura speaks out his duties as a guardian and his control over weather like thunder and wind which will prove difficult for Zyro's gang to overcome. Upon a thunderclap, Karura attaches Guardian Garudas to his Launcher Grip and rips it into battle while Kite does the same. Guardian Leviathan speeds toward Guardian Garudas and smashes it back. After landing, Karura commands Garudas to seemingly retreat which Leviathan chases but is struck by its opponent's surprise attack when Karura sends a blast of fire which throws the sea-dwelling Beyblade. Soon enough, Karura's Garudas barrages Guardian Leviathan with a forceful punch which also sends Leviathan flying with additional flames blowing it. Eight is concerned with the guard and launches Pirate Orochi to aid Kite and Leviathan. Despite his helpful effort, Karura summons raging winds which hinders the Beys. Zyro, Shinobu and Ren then agree they should be helping out as well and launch Samurai Ifrit, Ninja Salamander and Thief Phoenix, respectively. Karura is quick to react and sends Guardian Garudas to the sky in order to create another thunderclap which hits Ifrit, Salamander and Phoenix. Another thunder strike attacks Leviathan and Orochi, erupting lava takes Ifrit and Salamander while heavy wind blasts Phoenix.

        "After defeating Karura, Zyro and Co. finally infiltrate the DNA headquarters but are immediately confronted by the DNA Bladers. Although DNA are prepared to prevent Zyro and his friends from defeating Kira, they later are determined to bypass them. Subsequently every Blader launch their Beys into battle as Zyro starts with his Samurai Ifrit tackling Yoshio Bandit Golem into the air but Spike joins in by commanding Thief Girago to smash Ifrit. Shinobu battles Genj\u016bro but Ninja Salamander is no match for Bandit Genbu and its two helpers. On the other hand, Ren and her Thief Phoenix are powerful enough to continuously defeat multiple generic Beys from the DNA troops. Subsequently, Zyro encourage his teammates to work together and exterminate all other DNA Beyblades; being successful in doing so. Maru then suggests they all split up to cover more ground in the DNA household so tracking Kira can be easier and they agree. Genj\u016bro, Spike and Arrow are not satisfied and chase Zyro and Co. and yet, the latter do not know Team Garcias are watching their every move through surveillance cameras. Ren and Eight chose the same path but after eliminating many more DNA trainees, discover Enzo Garcia has blocked their route through Beyblade-proof metal doors. Unable to escape, the two trap themselves in a dead-end once Spike and Arrow have caught up to them with an army of more DNA trainers. Despite their best efforts in sending out Thief Phoenix and Pirate Orochi, electricity originating from the DNA stronghold roofs strike the beys forcing them to battle each other without their owners' commands. Spike soon launches Girago to destroy Phoenix while Arrow's Archer Wyvern does the same to Orochi. After Pirate Orochi lands from a Wyvang attack, Captain Arrow uses his special move, Arrow Tornado which throws Ren and Eight against a wall. Meanwhile, Shinobu runs a solo route only to confront Genj\u016bro. They engage in battle but Genj\u016bro encases Genbu and Salamander in a giant, glass cage which only makes matters worse. Genbu jumps across multiple points in the cage and smash lands Salamander, knocking the flaming reptile away. Despite Salamander landing, Genj\u016bro's strategy involves repeating the same technique again and again with Ninja Salamander helpless as Shinobu is forced to watch his Bey being assaulted to no end. Zyro and Maru however, discover a door that upon entering gaze at a familiar sight. They discover the Beystadium previously used during Zyro's Synchrome Battle against Kira. Yoshio enters through an opposite door to announce their Beybattle, and Zyro complies. Samurai Ifrit and Golem do battle but the former find itself knocked back from the first strike. After more smashes which do nothing to the Golem, Maru discovers the problem: Yoshio's Beyblade is a Synchrome. Instead of using Bandit Golem, Yoshio reveals how he took Kira's Berserker Behemoth after Kira abandoned it for future uses. Now with it, Yoshio created Behemoth Golem, an unstoppable force Zyro cannot overcome with a Synchrome-less Bey. Elsewhere, Gingka awakens to shockingly find out he is chained to a wall after Xiao played a booby trap and stole his beyblade. Gingka horridly watches Yoshio beating Zyro, a helpless Shinobu versus Genj\u016bro and Ren and Eight playing victim to Spike and Captain Arrow. When the Legendary Blader attempts to free himself, his arms are electrocuted as a result. Subsequently his old enemy, Doji appears which shocks Gingka from not seeing him since seven years ago. Gingka exclaims how Doji should be dead, but Doji tells him it is quite the opposite and explains how Merci revived him by converting Doji into a hologram and details DNA's future plans. Gingka knows Doji and DNA will not get away with this but is again electricity-shocked after another attempt at leaving; which only pleases Doji, whom manically laughs. Whilst Zyro still struggles with Yoshio, Shinobu continues against Genj\u016bro. After a hit from Genbu where Salamander hits the glass case, Shinobu notices a small crack inflicted. Acknowledging this, the Invincible Salamander will have Salamander hit the glass points with more force in order, to successfully, crack open the glass cage and free itself. Shniobu finishes off Genjuro with Excellent Scorching Ring Attack and eliminates Genbu along with severely burning its owner. Ren and Eight are still suffering at the hands of Spike and Captain Arrow, though. Just when Thief Girago and Archer Wyvern plan to issue a final hit against them, a nearby door explosion sees two familiar Beyblades enter: Archer Griffin and Ronin Dragoon. The surprise alarms all spectators, including Gingka and Doji as Sakyo and Takanosuke crash the party. Returning from their intensive training for the cancelled second Beyblade World Championship, Sakyo and Takanosuke were irritated so they will destroy the organization responsible for the cancellation: DNA. The Bladers of Air prove their point when Archer Griffin and Ronin Dragoon instantly wipe out their enemies. All the DNA Bladers' Beys have crashed to the ceilings, saving Ren and Eight. Sakyo and Takanosuke retract their Beyblades and take their leaveance. Zyro continues to battle Yoshio and is being struck with a powerful hammer-like blow from Behemoth Golem. Yoshio laughs at this and Zyro attempts to use his own attack power which does hold against Behemoth Golem, but Maru knows that it is futile. Shinobu bursts in with his Salamander and launches it into the stadium, making the battle somewhat even as it is now 2 against 2-in-1. Sakyo and Takanosuke head towards Zyro and Shinobu's battle with Yoshio and offer their help. Deeming this an unfair fight, Sakyo and Takanosuke announce their Synchrome Bey: Griffin Dragoon. The two inform Zyro and the gang how they will take care of Yoshio and they can move on to defeating DNA. Appreciative of this, Zyro, Maru, and Shinobu leave the stadium. Now as a trio, they continue their infiltration to finding Kira. Gingka also converses with Doji, assuring how Zyro and Co. will succeed but Doji says otherwise. With the sound of 3, 2, 1, Sakyo and Yoshio launch their Synchrome Beys into action. With the Behemoth Golem tackling the Griffin Dragoon.",

        "After defeating Xiao, Zyro, Maru and Shinobu find Doji in the Dark Fortress chamber with the prisoned Gingka. Doji, who is now manifested as a hologram of his former self electrocutes Zyro and brings forth Kira to dispose of the heroes with Pegasus Bahamut. Hearing his signature Beyblade's name, Gingka is confused and outraged as a result even more when Doji shows the Legendary Blader of his Bey remaining parts safely kept away in storage. Doji subsequently explains how each of DNA's top Bladers strongly used their tactics to stopping Zyro's friends from preventing DNA's goal. Zyro is however angered and goes on to detail their best efforts in defeating DNA, with Kite, Eight and Ren who he refers to. Zyro remains confident as always and announces DNA's defeat. This amuses Doji as Kira approaches his old rival seemingly prepared for the last battle. Shinobu assures Zyro's planned victory by lending his best friend with the Salamander Warrior Wheel to create their signature Synchrome: Salamander Ifrit. Zyro takes it as a friendly remark and respectful sign, now able to intimidate Kira with their scorching Synchrome. Doji then calls forth the Cyclone Stadium being elevated from underground to set the battle stage. Zyro and Kira enter their respective platforms and signal \"3...2...1 - Let It Rip!\" as Salamander Ifrit will clash with Pegasus Bahamut. A sudden explosive burst is emitted as the Fire and God Synchromes make contact. Kira's Pegasus Bahamut knocks back Salamander Ifrit as Zyro attempts to get things together. Whilst Maru scans information concerning Kira's Synchrome, Shinobu encourages Zyro despite the Breaking-Mountain Killer in throne to the upper hand. Kira's words and the divine Bahamut and Pegasus hybrid strikes Zyro in fear. Zyro is constantly being thrown away in defeat, watching Pegasus Bahamut own Salamander Ifrit as electrical energy backlashes with every hit. Gingka still cheers on Zyro and struggles to break free of the chains. Doji meanwhile manically laughs, providing a speech on DNA's goals and intentions which Kira is fulfilling much to his delight. Zyro and Kira still battle in the form of their Beys but Salamander Ifrit still succumbs and stays on the losing side. At last, Kira uses his full potential when a purple aura surrounds him yet Zyro mimics this by bursting out his Bey spirit something which alarms Kira, Doji and Gingka. Zyro channels his strength to Salamander Ifrit who makes a comeback and lifts and throws its opponent away with Maru cheering, as a result. The fight unfolds but Kira still keeps his intention to win and counters with Pegasus Bahamut striking away at Salamander Ifrit. Zyro and Kira converse while their beys continue their assault on one-another. The fire demon and the divine beats blow punches to their opposing forces. Gingka is confident that Zyro will prevail but Doji likes to think otherwise when he has another surprise up his sleeve. Doji announces his very own mecha designed for him. In this large robot, Doji can control its movements through entering it and brings a unique Beyblade in it to the battle. This shocks everybody, including Tsubasa, Madoka and Benkei back at the WBBA. Doji's mecha launches it which appears to team-up with Pegasus Bahamut in taking down Salamander Ifrit, to which Zyro's Synchrome is knocked back. Although Kira is confused and distracted for a while, he re-shifts his focus to the current battle and barrages Salamander Ifrit, despite Doji's Beyblade interrupting it as it strikes Pegasus Bahamut. Kira is irritated and commands his God Synchrome to attack Doji's Bey instead. Kira then calls out for Zyro's help in exterminating Doji's Beyblade under the condition they may continue their battle afterwards. Zyro accepts and the two are ready to defeat Doji.",

        "Zyro and Kira are in the midst of their Beybattle, having temporarily joining forces to defeat Doji's new Bey who has betrayed Kira. While the Blader of Fire controls Salamander Ifrit , a Fire Synchrome, the Breaking-Mountain Killer commands the God Synchrome: Pegasis Bahamut. The Beys clash with such force in their epic battle, leaving battle marks in the Cyclone Stadium's floor. Subsequently, both Bladers command their Beys to encircle their arena, leaving behind blazing trails and divine ones. Zyro and Kira activate their full potential and summon their corresponding Bladers' Spirits which phenomenally levitate the Cyclone Stadium in mid-air. As a result, Team Garcias and Tsubasa, Madoka and Benkei are just shocked by this amazing sight. Kira finds himself in a celestial location, similar to the place where Gingka taught Zyro the Blader's Spirit. Zyro then speaks to Kira, revealing how powerful the Blader's Spirit can be, and the powers that be which forego it. All the while their respective Beys duke it out with everlasting clashes which occur. The two rivals are in their battle's climax and are prepared to finish it. Kira utilizes his Pegasus Bahamut's special move, Final Ultimate Demolition whilst Zyro uses Burning Tornado Fire. The Ifrit and Salamander hybrid speeds towards the Bahamut and Pegasus hybrid in one final clash to determine the result. The powers from the Bladers' special moves destroy the Beystadium. Bits and pieces are sent flying around every direction and spectator as Shinobu covers Maru in order to protect her. Pegasus Bahamut is thrown into a wall near Gingka while as the mist clears, Salamander Ifrit is still spinning. While the result is shocking for all, Kira collapses in his defeat unable to realize how he actually lost. His pondering comes short when what remains of the Cyclone Stadium turns sideways. Due to gravity, Kira falls back but grabs onto a ledge for protection. The solid Stadium remains then falls over Kira, discarding his pull with Kira falling off. Shinobu and Maru are worried, but Zyro is fast enough to grab Kira and save his life. Zyro gives Kira a short talk on friendship and how Kira does not deserve to die because he can become a better person without being a DNA affiliate. Though Kira accepts his words, the arena bowl draws nearer to eventually collapsing and possibly killing both Bladers. Out of nowhere, Yoshio dashes and leaps over to the Stadium under destruction. Finding Zyro who has Kira in his grip, he literally picks up Zyro and throws him over the ledge to safe, solid ground. Yoshio makes an effort to save his own life too and jumps off grabbing the ledge with a sigh of relief to everyone. Doji is unhappy about this however, because after the Stadium falls in full, he hacks all the computers in the Dark Fortress, leaving the Garcias unable to work on it. Meanwhile, Ren and Eight desperately try to find Zyro, Maru and Shinobu but instead find Kite. He tells them of a way to escape the Dark Fortress, but that they must find the rest of their gang first. Due to the destruction, Gingka's chains are broken and is finally free from them, though he notices Pegasus Face Bolt, Samurai Crystal Wheel and the W105 Spin Track beside him. Doji's mecha however brings forth additional legs to travel. This giant robot frightens Zyro, Maru, Shinobu, Kira and Yoshio. Zyro does not back away and launches Salamander Ifrit to assault it, but it is no use. When the mecha seems ready to destroy them, another Beyblade hits Doji's mecha. Samurai Pegasus Spirit distracts Doji who is revealed to have come from Gingka, who reassembled his temporary missing Beyblade. Zyro aims to help Gingka defeat Doji's mecha but Doji does not see it, this way. His mecha suddenly shifts gears and transforms itself into the unthinkable: a giant Beyblade. Terrified by the sight, the group slowly walks back while Zyro and Gingka command their Beyblades to attack it but are no match for the Doji's mecha Beyblade which spins like a miniature tornado. As the mecha Beyblade approaches them, the group run away while Zyro and Gingka run together according to their plan. Doji's mecha Bey chases the two but they command their Beyblades to attack it albeit still to no effect. Due to this, their only chances for survival are dodging Doji's mecha Beyblade so as to not be shred apart. Kira then asks Yoshio for Behemoth Golem. Team Garcias are still confused by the hacking Doji committed. With no choices left, Argo commands his siblings to let everything go, end their partnership with DNA and leave. The family agree and run off into the distance, though vowing to return someday. Although Zyro and Gingka struggle to defeat Doji, Kira launches out Behemoth Golem at the Dojo mecha Beyblade. Kira announces his decision to leave DNA and side with Zyro and Co. who is dissatisfied with what Doji has done to DNA and ends his affiliation with it. The three Bladers let out their true potential in the real final battle. Zyro activates Super Burning Uppercut while Gingka uses Galaxy Nova and Kira creates Rising Gaia Hammer. The three special moves combine to create one of the most powerful moves in Beyblade history. The moves swirl together and land on Doji's mecha Beyblade, causing it to cease spin, completely. The Bladers retract their Beyblades while Doji's mecha Beyblade starts to malfunction and returns to its spider-like, mobile mode. Doji announces to them that despite their efforts in causing his mecha to malfunction, he will not let them love beyond this day. Instead, he will commit suicide with his mecha to fall off the hole the Cyclone Stadium did. Once this occurs, the explosion will be so powerful that it shall destroy the Dark Fortress and anyone inside it. As this shocks Zyro and the gang, Doji commits to his claim and does suicide by commanding his mecha to fall off into the hole. Subsequently, an explosion draws up from it and the Dark Fortress is about to be destroyed. Zyro and Co. make a move to escape, finding Ren and Eight who follow them. They later find Genj\u016bro, Spike , Captain Arrow and Xiao at a dead-end who also need to escape. Just then, Griffin Dragoon creates a space in the dead end by Sakyo and Takanosuke. The gang are grateful for this and they all successfully escape the Dark Fortress. Everyone, Zyro's friend and former DNA members alike watch the Dark Fortress in its timely destruction. Maru receives a call on her laptop from the WBBA. Maru answers to Madoka where the former is happy to announce everyone is doing well and fine. Madoka becomes happy, with also makes Tsubasa happy while causes Benkei to go borderline as he crushingly bear hugs Tsubasa and Madoka with tears of job for the survival of Zyro and Co. While everybody is relieved to be alive and well, Kira has something in mind to take their minds away from this calamity. Sometime later, a massive crowd fills lines for the Metal Bey City BeyPark for a new tournament succeeding Battle Bladers. With Blader Gai announcing it, the new tournament is named \"The Bridge to the Future\" and celebrates the efforts Zyro and Co. took to defeating DNA which would save the world and pave the way for more Beyblade. This tournament features an ensemble consisting of the former DNA Bladers pitted against the new Zyro and Co. who have added Sakyo and Takanosuke to their line-up. The stage is set, the spectators are ready and the Beybladers are ready to Beyblade.",

Samurai Pegasus Spirit distracts Doji who is revealed to have come from Gingka, who reassembled his temporary missing Beyblade. Zyro aims to help Gingka defeat Doji's mecha but Doji does not see it, this way. His mecha suddenly shifts gears and transforms itself into the unthinkable: a giant Beyblade. Terrified by the sight, the group slowly walks back while Zyro and Gingka command their Beyblades to attack it but are no match for the Doji's mecha Beyblade which spins like a miniature tornado. As the mecha Beyblade approaches them, the group run away while Zyro and Gingka run together according to their plan. Doji's mecha Bey chases the two but they command their Beyblades to attack it albeit still to no effect. Due to this, their only chances for survival are dodging Doji's mecha Beyblade so as to not be shred apart. Kira then asks Yoshio for Behemoth Golem. Team Garcias are still confused by the hacking Doji committed. With no choices left, Argo commands his siblings to let everything go, end their partnership with DNA and leave. The family agree and run off into the distance, though vowing to return someday. Although Zyro and Gingka struggle to defeat Doji, Kira launches out Behemoth Golem at the Dojo mecha Beyblade. Kira announces his decision to leave DNA and side with Zyro and Co. who is dissatisfied with what Doji has done to DNA and ends his affiliation with it. The three Bladers let out their true potential in the real final battle. Zyro activates Super Burning Uppercut while Gingka uses Galaxy Nova and Kira creates Rising Gaia Hammer. The three special moves combine to create one of the most powerful moves in Beyblade history. The moves swirl together and land on Doji's mecha Beyblade, causing it to cease spin, completely. The Bladers retract their Beyblades while Doji's mecha Beyblade starts to malfunction and returns to its spider-like, mobile mode. Doji announces to them that despite their efforts in causing his mecha to malfunction, he will not let them love beyond this day. Instead, he will commit suicide with his mecha to fall off the hole the Cyclone Stadium did. Once this occurs, the explosion will be so powerful that it shall destroy the Dark Fortress and anyone inside it. As this shocks Zyro and the gang, Doji commits to his claim and does suicide by commanding his mecha to fall off into the hole. Subsequently, an explosion draws up from it and the Dark Fortress is about to be destroyed. Zyro and Co. make a move to escape, finding Ren and Eight who follow them. They later find Genj\u016bro, Spike , Captain Arrow and Xiao at a dead-end who also need to escape. Just then, Griffin Dragoon creates a space in the dead end by Sakyo and Takanosuke. The gang are grateful for this and they all successfully escape the Dark Fortress. Everyone, Zyro's friend and former DNA members alike watch the Dark Fortress in its timely destruction. Maru receives a call on her laptop from the WBBA. Maru answers to Madoka where the former is happy to announce everyone is doing well and fine. Madoka becomes happy, with also makes Tsubasa happy while causes Benkei to go borderline as he crushingly bear hugs Tsubasa and Madoka with tears of job for the survival of Zyro and Co. While everybody is relieved to be alive and well, Kira has something in mind to take their minds away from this calamity. Sometime later, a massive crowd fills lines for the Metal Bey City BeyPark for a new tournament succeeding Battle Bladers. With Blader Gai announcing it, the new tournament is named \"The Bridge to the Future\" and celebrates the efforts Zyro and Co. took to defeating DNA which would save the world and pave the way for more Beyblade. This tournament features an ensemble consisting of the former DNA Bladers pitted against the new Zyro and Co. who have added Sakyo and Takanosuke to their line-up. The stage is set, the spectators are ready and the Beybladers are ready to Beyblade.",
        "Zyro and Kira are in the midst of their Beybattle, having temporarily joining forces to defeat Doji's new Bey who has betrayed Kira. While the Blader of Fire controls Salamander Ifrit , a Fire Synchrome, the Breaking-Mountain Killer commands the God Synchrome: Pegasis Bahamut. The Beys clash with such force in their epic battle, leaving battle marks in the Cyclone Stadium's floor. Subsequently, both Bladers command their Beys to encircle their arena, leaving behind blazing trails and divine ones. Zyro and Kira activate their full potential and summon their corresponding Bladers' Spirits which phenomenally levitate the Cyclone Stadium in mid-air. As a result, Team Garcias and Tsubasa, Madoka and Benkei are just shocked by this amazing sight. Kira finds himself in a celestial location, similar to the place where Gingka taught Zyro the Blader's Spirit. Zyro then speaks to Kira, revealing how powerful the Blader's Spirit can be, and the powers that be which forego it. All the while their respective Beys duke it out with everlasting clashes which occur. The two rivals are in their battle's climax and are prepared to finish it. Kira utilizes his Pegasus Bahamut's special move, Final Ultimate Demolition whilst Zyro uses Burning Tornado Fire. The Ifrit and Salamander hybrid speeds towards the Bahamut and Pegasus hybrid in one final clash to determine the result. The powers from the Bladers' special moves destroy the Beystadium. Bits and pieces are sent flying around every direction and spectator as Shinobu covers Maru in order to protect her. Pegasus Bahamut is thrown into a wall near Gingka while as the mist clears, Salamander Ifrit is still spinning. While the result is shocking for all, Kira collapses in his defeat unable to realize how he actually lost. His pondering comes short when what remains of the Cyclone Stadium turns sideways. Due to gravity, Kira falls back but grabs onto a ledge for protection. The solid Stadium remains then falls over Kira, discarding his pull with Kira falling off. Shinobu and Maru are worried, but Zyro is fast enough to grab Kira and save his life. Zyro gives Kira a short talk on friendship and how Kira does not deserve to die because he can become a better person without being a DNA affiliate. Though Kira accepts his words, the arena bowl draws nearer to eventually collapsing and possibly killing both Bladers. Out of nowhere, Yoshio dashes and leaps over to the Stadium under destruction. Finding Zyro who has Kira in his grip, he literally picks up Zyro and throws him over the ledge to safe, solid ground. Yoshio makes an effort to save his own life too and jumps off grabbing the ledge with a sigh of relief to everyone. Doji is unhappy about this however, because after the Stadium falls in full, he hacks all the computers in the Dark Fortress, leaving the Garcias unable to work on it. Meanwhile, Ren and Eight desperately try to find Zyro, Maru and Shinobu but instead find Kite. He tells them of a way to escape the Dark Fortress, but that they must find the rest of their gang first. Due to the destruction, Gingka's chains are broken and is finally free from them, though he notices Pegasus Face Bolt, Samurai Crystal Wheel and the W105 Spin Track beside him. Doji's mecha however brings forth additional legs to travel. This giant robot frightens Zyro, Maru, Shinobu, Kira and Yoshio. Zyro does not back away and launches Salamander Ifrit to assault it, but it is no use. When the mecha seems ready to destroy them, another Beyblade hits Doji's mecha.
