        "The story begins in Yuushu (\u5e7d\u5dde), where a couple of Yellow Scarves troops are harassing some villagers. Ryuubi Gundam steps in and easily chases off the two. He is thanked, and soon, Kousonsan Ez-8 arrives and comments on how Ryuubi should think before he acts.

He soon sees two warriors engaging each other, one with red armour, and another with green armour. Ryuubi draws the Ryuuteiken to stop the battle, but it didn't awaken like when he was fighting against Bagengi. He decides to personally stop the two from fighting, but trips in the process. When he regains consciousness, the two warriors introduced themselves: The red one is called Chouhi Gundam, while the green one is Kan-u Gundam, though Chouhi prefers to call him Demon Beard.

Chouhi then takes Ryuubi on a tour around his village, stating that he has been protecting it against the Yellow Scarves.

Ryofu appears in front of Toutaku, and grabs the Gyokuji, summoning the Tengyokuyai in Shinbu (\u771f\u6b66) form. Shiba-i is taken back by this turn of events, as Ryofu rushes in, finishing Toutaku off once and for all. The Tengyokuyai also proceeds to decimate the Biujiyou, killing Riju as well.

        "Ryofu is engaged in battle with Sousou and Sonsaku, just before the arrows rained down. As they did, many of the Infantry GMs and Zakus are hit. Sonken rushes in to protect Sonshoukou, while the other generals watched in disbelief. Kan-u comments on how tyrannical Toutaku is to injure his own troops, just as Ryofu is hit. The arrow volley continues and more are killed. When the volley stops, the battlefield is filled with corpses from both sides. Ryofu still stands, and pulls out the arrows on his back, demanding to finish the battle with the heroes. Toutaku comments on how Ryofu has served him well up till now, but it's time for him to be wiped out with the Alliance. Toutaku aims, and fires his shoulder cannons.

Over at Joshuu, Ryuubi, Kan-u and Chouhi are tilling the land with the fellow villagers, though Chouhi seems to be complaining about how he's going to get rusty at battles. They all decided to take a break, but Chouhi wanted to finish up first. The other two left with the villagers, and Chouhi finishes his proud plot of land, only to be ruined by Kirei jumping in. Chouhi is shocked to see Enjyutsu and his army, and easily repels off Kirei. Just as he is on his way to take Enjyutsu's head, Ryofu steps in. Shocked to see Ryofu alive, Chouhi hesitates. Ryofu claims to be a God from Hell, and unleashed his new finishing technique. The episode ends with Chouhi looking on in fear."

        "The episode carries on from the previous episode, with Chouhi facing off against Ryofu's fearsome attack. Chouhi only barely manages to block it, and is blown away by the attack's sheer power. Ryofu walks off, and Enjyutsu instructs his army to advance and invade Joshuu, with Chouhi struggling to get up. Over at Joshuu, Ryuubi and Kan-u are preparing some food for the late Chouhi, only to be attacked by a shower of burning arrows. Ryuubi is enraged at the peace being broken, and swears to defeat the invaders. Ryuubi and Kan-u managed to retreat most of the villagers to the main Governor's house, just as Enjyutsu's troops break in. The two are enraged at Enjyutsu's actions, and manages to repel the troops off. However, Ryuubi spots smoke from a neighbouring village, and the villagers fear the worst. Just then, Chouhi breaks through, calling them to retreat out of Joshuu. Ryuubi argues that they should be defending the village, but Chouhi retorts saying that the sheer number of troops have the advantage. With reluctance, Ryuubi and Kan-u lead the villagers out of Joshuu, and mention that they can take refugee over at Yuushu. However, the villagers are tired from the running, and Enjyutsu catches up with them. The sworn brothers prepare for their last stand, just as Sousou arrives to intercept Enjyutsu. Enjyutsu pulls out the Gyokuji and tries to summon the Tengyokuyai, but fails. He then retreats, having won Joshuu. Sousou reprimands Ryuubi's naiveness of peace, and that Ryuubi is the one responsible for the fall of Joshuu, as well as the loss of the villagers' peace and happiness.

Sousou proceeds to say that the refugees can stay in Kyoshou, and even let Chouhi and Kan-u become his generals, but with one condition: That Ryuubi forsakes his love for the people. Sousou believes that sympathy is not needed to unify Mirish, only through force can peace be totally achieved. Ryuubi strongly disagrees, but hestitates to reply.

        "Sousou and the 3 sworn brothers have arrived in Jushun, but were too late to help Sonsaku. Enjyutsu gloats, and sends his army to intercept them all. The 2 factions easily defeats Enjyutsu's army, and storms the castle. In his throne room, Enjyutsu gloats that with Ryofu, they will not reach him easily. His monologue is cut short with Sousou, Kakouton, Kakouen and the 3 sworn brothers barged in. It seems Ryofu and his team have abandoned him, and Enjyutsu is in a total panic. He tries to summon the Tengyokugai, but fails miserably. As the allied forces rush in to finish Enjyutsu off, the Gyokuji glowed with darkness, and formed a forcefield around Enjyutsu. Enjyutsu gloats, and summons the dark power, which destroys the castle, flinging out the heroes. As the dust settles, Enjyutsu dons a new armor, the Hishou Keitai (\u98db\u7fd4\u5f62\u614b), granted from the darkness within the Gyokuji. He flies over the battlefield, and gloats at his new power as he indiscriminately attacks. Sonshoukou retaliates, but is easily overpowered. Sonken rushes in to check on her, as Enjyutsu tries a sneak attack. As Enjyutsu continues to gloat of his invincibility, and badmouths Sonken Zephyranthes and Sonsaku, Sonken swears to never forgive Enjyutsu and his tyranny, to which the Gyokuji responds with a golden light. With his courage, Sonken has summoned the Tengyokugai in Douko (\u5f29\u864e) form, and easily overpowers Enjyustu, and destroys whatever was left of Jushun. As the Gyokuji and the Tengyokugai fly off to parts unknown, Sonken is shocked at the destruction he has caused. It's nightfall at Kishuu, Enshou is enjoying some wine when his guard informs him that Enjyustu is currently at the castle gate, requesting an audience with him. Enshou replies that he knows no such person, and orders to turn him away. Enshou comments that he has no need for a fool who doesn't have the Gyokuji. As the castle gates close, Enjyutsu begs to see his brother. Being turned down, Enjyutsu walks away in the rain, all tattered, limping and coughing. He trips over a puddle and smashes his favourite honey jar. On his final breath, Enjyutsu wishes he could taste his favourite honey again, and dies soon after.",

At Enchou's camp, he gloats that he will be the one to unify Mirisha, by first invading the weakened Yuushu forces. In the background, the Gyouji glows with an omnious aura inside Enjyustu's Hishou Keitai armour. However, Enshou fears the Hakuba Jin, to which Soju and Denpou have a plan to counter it. Outside, Choukou Zaku III is training his platoon for the coming battle, and Denpou orders Choukou to lead his platoon into the frontlines, to which Choukou proudly accepts. Somewhere else, the 3 sworn brothers are leading the Yuushu villagers to Ekikyourou (\u6613\u4eac\u697c), a fortress within mountains.

A bit shocked at the request, Koumei points at that Suikyou Guntank might know, and gives the 2 directions to Suikyou's residence. The 2 soon arrive, and is invited in by Suikyou. Upon asking why the 2 needs his help, Ryuubi relates how Enshou's troops is threatening the peace and wants to stop him before innocent lives are lost, and thus require Fukuryuu's assistance. However, Suikyou says that Fukuryuu once used his stratagems to fight against Toutaku, but he lost many of his men, and has thus \"died\" from grief. Depressed, Ryuubi and Chouhi leaves.

He then remembers the Gyokuji, and comments that this is the time to use it and with it, he will be granted unlimited power needed to defeat all that oppose him.

Ryuubi does not falter, but even with their combined strength of 25,000, it's still not enough against Sousou's one million in strength. Shuuyu approaches, and wants to show something to them. At a weaponry storehouse, there are numerous Siege Weapons (Actor: YMS-16M Xamel) and bombs. Shuuyu then reveals the Tenraikahou (\u5929\u96f7\u706b\u7832). Everyone is impressed, and Kougetsuei Gun-EZ appears to explain the Tenraikahou. She also takes out a special kind of cannon ammunition, specially made for the Tenraikahou, that is capable of destroying hundreds of vessels, especially Sousou's water fortress. However, there's only one, so they can't affort to miss. The Tenraikahou also has a limitation, in that it can only be fire at a rather short range, meaning anyone that uses it will come under fire. Sonken decides to lead the water assault by disguising the Tenraikahou on a vessel, while Ryuubi leads the land forces to cover for Sonken. At the Koutou castle, Ryuubi and Sonken are admiring the peaceful view, when Kougai asks for their presence. The people of Koutou have made flower charms for all of them, blessing them success and a safe return. The episode ends with the Alliance all geared up for the coming battle at Sekiheki.",

Back at Koutou, Kougai is mad, yet relieved at Sonshoukou's return. Ryuubi notices a letter attached to one of the arrows. It's a letter calling for Sonken's and Ryuubi's surrender. Ryuubi does not falter, but even with their combined strength of 25,000, it's still not enough against Sousou's one million in strength. Shuuyu approaches, and wants to show something to them.

She also takes out a special kind of cannon ammunition, specially made for the Tenraikahou, that is capable of destroying hundreds of vessels, especially Sousou's water fortress. However, there's only one, so they can't affort to miss. The Tenraikahou also has a limitation, in that it can only be fire at a rather short range, meaning anyone that uses it will come under fire. Sonken decides to lead the water assault by disguising the Tenraikahou on a vessel, while Ryuubi leads the land forces to cover for Sonken. At the Koutou castle, Ryuubi and Sonken are admiring the peaceful view, when Kougai asks for their presence. The people of Koutou have made flower charms for all of them, blessing them success and a safe return. The episode ends with the Alliance all geared up for the coming battle at Sekiheki.",

        "The episode recaps Sousou setting up a water fortress at Sekiheki, and the Alliance between Ryuubi and Sonken preparing their assault. In the thick fog, Sonken's fleet slowly make their approach towards Sekiheki. When the fog clears, they are shocked to see that a whole fleet of Sousou ships have formed a defensive wall in front of Sousou's fortress. This fleet is led by Saibou Agguguy, an admiral of Keishuu. Sonken is shocked at this development, as Saibou orders an arrow shower. Sonken counters with his on-board Siege Weapon, but the ships remained unscathed. Saibou gloats, commenting that their ships are lined with steel. On the surrounding cliffs, Chouryou and his troops are preparing another arrow shower, but is foiled by Ryuubi and his cohorts. Sonken's fleet is slowly capsized by Saibou's fleet, and Sonken fears all is lost. However, Kougai has a plan of his own. As more of Sonken's ships are sunk, Kougai rides off on a jetski, pulling a large load of bombs behind him. He plans to ride into Saibou's fleet, and detonate the load. Sonken and Sonshoukou try in vain to call Kougai back, but he has made up his mind. Saibou orders another arrow shower, but Kougai presses on. Even after being shot by a few arrows, Kougai vows to accomplish his mission for Mirisha's future. He collides with the lead ship, and dies in the resulting explosion. The explosion kills off Saibou, and his entire fleet is engulfed in flames. With the path cleared, Sonken holds back his tears, and orders Shuuyu to fire the Tenraikahou. The blast hits Sousou's fortress straight on, and Tashiji believes they have won. However, Rikuson spots the fortress moving, and it is revealed that Sousou's true fortress is a huge metal battleship (basis is the Gwadan), the Tekkousenkan Shinkahouou (\u9244\u7532\u6226\u8266 \u795e\u706b\u9cf3\u51f0).

The episode ends with Ryuubi looking forward to the bright future that they will create.",
        "The story recaps how Ryuubi becomes Shouretsutei Ryuusou Ryuubi Gundam. Upon Shuuyu's request, Sonken joins in the battle, calling out to Sonken Zephyranthes and Sonsaku for courage. Sousou and Ryuubi are evenly matched, as Sonken interferes. Sousou is enraged at Sonken interfering with his will, the Heaven's will. Sonken comments that he'll do anything to protect his family, and Ryuubi comment that it's Heaven's will to help the people. The 2's conviction impresses Sousou, but he will not let the 2 interfere in his ambition. Just then, the Gyokuji glows and leaves Sousou, bathing Ryuubi and Sonken in its golden light. Shiba-i and Kakuka rushes to the deck of the battleship, and witnesses Sonken in Tengyokugai Douko form, and Ryuubi in Tengyokugai Souryuu (\u84bc\u9f8d) form. Kakuka is shocked to see 3 Tengyokugais, as Shiba-i explains that the 3, having inherited the souls of the Three Sovereigns, have shaken the foundations of Heaven itself, and that the following battle is one of legendary status, one that the G-Chronicles has failed to predict. The three heroes summon up their Sovereign spirits as they fly towards their final battlefield, outer space. The three clash with all their strength, and at the final blow, a huge star (one would recognize it as the star of Ryuubi's Dragon Star Slash) forms over Mirisha. Sousou is appalled, appalled that he has lost to Sonken and Ryuubi's strength, a strength that comes from compassion for the people. As the Tengyokugai disintegrates around him, Sousou comments that their duel is not over, and that a new era has begun on this day, a day where Mirisha is ruled by compassion. As Sousou's Tengyokugai explodes, he plummets through the atmosphere, and seemingly explodes into millions of meteors that streak across Mirisha's night sky. His Seihouken lands back on the ground, as Kakouton fears the worst. Chouryou drops his weapons, and wants Kan-u to kill him, however Kan-u tells him to live on. Kakuka cannot believe Sousou is dead, but Shiba-i assures him that Sousou isn't, and that they will carry on his will to unify Mirisha. The Gyokuji drifts off into the depths of space, as some time has past on Mirisha. At Rakuyou, Souhi Gundam asks Shiba-i if Sousou has been found. Shiba-i, now as Giga Taifu (\u6a5f\u99d5\u592a\u5085), updates him that the search is still ongoing. Souhi thanks Shiba-i, and Sousou for helping him to find, and build his kingdom. In front of his troops, Souhi gives a speech, to remember the events of Sekiheki, and that with the formation of their kingdom, Giga (\u6a5f\u99d5), they will carry on Sousou's will. At Koutou, the Son family pays respect to Sonken Zephyranthes, Sonsaku and all the fallen troops. Sonshoukou informs them of the formation of their kingdom, Gou (\u8f5f). Sonken swears that he will do everything to protect their kingdom and family. Shuuyu is relieved, and comments on joining Sonsaku, and he soon dies peacefully in his chair. At Ekishuu (\u76ca\u5dde), Ryuubi and his faction are almost at their destination, when Chouhi complains of tiredness. Chou-un is glad of Ryuubi's safe return, as it's a boast to the people's moral and trust. As Ryuubi thanks them, Koumei signals to them that they have arrived. Ryuubi comments that without the people, there will be no kingdom, to which Koumei agrees, and their kingdom, Shou (\u7fd4), is formed. The episode ends with Ryuubi looking forward to the bright future that they will create."

Meanwhile, the boy from the mansion is in the same place and is looking around at some things. Later on, Shiho, Rina and Nagisa go out to town and visits the souvenir store. Honoka and Hikari meet up with them and they travel to a mountainside area and split up. Nagisa, Honoka and Hikari find Prosun (the Heartiel from the previous episode) but Uraganos comes in and they are told by Wishun that the \"truth\" is almost there. Nagisa and Honoka transform and fight a Zakenna. Meanwhile, Wishun senses something and yells about the \"truth\" almost being here. Hikari follows her but is led to nowhere. She meets the boy from the mansion and their surroundings are covered by darkness. Mipple and Mepple sense this and Cure Black and Cure White do a fake Marble Screw Max in order to get away from Uraganos and reach Hikari. Hikari and the boy continue to stare at each other and they suddenly faint. Cure Black and Cure White get there in time and catch Hikari whilst Viblis catches the boy. She takes him away and Uraganos catches up to Cure Black and Cure White; they try to summon their Sparkle Bracelets but are interrupted by him, so they attack him and summon their bracelets. After receiving this, they do the Marble Screw Max and destroy the Zakenna. On the way home, Hikari is still sleeping and Nagisa and Honoka talks about their trip."

Therefore, the ICJ had judged only the legality of the declaration of independence itself, not the legal status of Kosovo as a consequence of the declaration and not the jurisdictional effects of the recognition of Kosovo. The ICJ also does not clarify if unilateral declaration allowed for the legal creation of the state nor if international law allows secession. In these conditions, the Ministry would continue in its opposition to Kosovo's recognition."

        "The story begins with the 3 sworn brothers being chased by some Toutaku troops. Forced to a cliff, the 3 engaged the troops, easily overpowering them with their finishing techniques. Just then, on a bridge at the cliff, Koshin Gyan taunts the 3, with Chouhi falling into Koshin's trap. Koshin leaps out of the way, and destroys the bridge, causing the 3 sworn brothers to fall into the river below. Back at Rakuyou, Koshin reports back to Toutaku on his victory, but Toutaku is infuriated that Koshin failed to obtain the Ryuuteiken from Ryuubi. Koshin stakes his life and his title of Chinkou Shougun (\u93ae\u6c5f\u5c06\u8ecd) to steal the Ryuuteiken. Ryuubi wakes up from the incident, after he dreamt of a dragon spirit in the river swallowing him. The 3 sworn brothers were saved by Bachou Blue Destiny, who found them washed up by the river. Ryuubi thanks Bachou, just as a villager bears news of an invasion. Ryuubi suspects it's more of Toutaku's troops, and the 3 rushes off to intercept them but Ryuubi notices he has lost the Ryuuteiken. Bachou tries to stop Ryuubi, but Ryuubi insists that he will help shape Mirisha's future with his own hands, even without the Ryuuteiken. The Toutaku troops are led by Koshin, and is pleased to see the 3 sworn brothers. The troops are again overpowered, but Koshin overpowers the 3 with another finishing technique. Bachou just cannot stand by and watch, and rushes back to the river to find the Ryuuteiken. He dives near the foot of a waterfall that's known to contain a dragon spirit. He soon encounters the spirit, to which it asks what is Bachou's purpose. Back at the duel, Ryuubi stands up against Koshin, and in unison with Bachou, proclaims to help Mirisha. The Ryuuteiken appears before Ryuubi's feet; Bachou found it thanks to the dragon spirit. Bachou and the village children cheers the 3 sworn brothers on (Bachou even asks the viewers to join in the cheering), and soon, Kan-u and Chouhi stands up again, and the 3 performs the Holy Trinity. Koshin is then destroyed. On a cliff, Ryofu, atop Sekitoba, comments on how he's have fun with the successor of the Ryuuteiken.",
