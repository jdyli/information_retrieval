He talks his way out of it, when Stewpot's parents come to complain, because the boys are scared of him. Mr. Baxter announces that Mr Hicks will be taking P.E. Mr. Hicks now has it in for Stewpot.

At school, Fay comes across Julian, intending to dump him. He breaks down though, before she can say anything, telling her about his dog being put down, but he then guesses that she was waiting for Jean Paul. At the deserted factory, Jean Paul's driving becomes reckless, and to make matters worth, Banksie's brother Phil turns up. Finally, the car goes out of control, and turns over... Sarah ends up in hospital, but Jean-Paul escapes unharmed. Mrs McClusky intends to suspend those involved - and Jean Paul will be sent back to France. Zammo has a go at Banksie, but he's already badly bruised from his brother's intervention.

Patsy's home life, an anorexic sister in America, her father working in espionage, all seem a little unbelievable to Lucy. Other Year 7's support Patsy, and the issue evolves into a dispute between Year 7 and Year 8's.Alex is involved with a \"second life\" type game without realizing he is chatting to Patsy who is on another terminal. Alison and Sammy make their own avatar and use a magazine to create a persona to talk to him with. Then they realize the magazine contains Patsy's fictional life story.

Trisha immediately wants to opt out, while Ann, with support from both Judy and Trisha, suggests that Tucker is an inappropriate choice, because he messes around.

        "It's the first day of a new term and Zammo collects girlfriend Jackie on the way to school. Suzanne is nearly 16, and is desperate to leave. Mr. Hopwood has left Grange Hill and Mr. Smart finds out he is H5's form tutor. Zammo leaves Jackie at her school, Brookdale, and makes some new enemies with the other Brookdale boys. Jonah's moved away and his cousin Jeremy Irving is now going to Grange Hill. Jonah tells Zammo that Brookdale is merging with Rodney Bennet and that is why he moved. Stewpot's Mr. Smart impression goes down well and Mr Smart turns up and overhears it. Annette's first incident with Miss Gordon, who is Miss Mooney's replacement, isn't good. Jeremy finds the print room is an excellent place to make fake bus tickets",

        "It's the end of term and tempers are getting frayed setting up a disco and Glenroy's enormous sound system that can only play Reggae. In celebration of the merger with Rodney Bennet and Brookdale, some members of Rodney Bennett school are at Grange Hill. Zammo is pleased when Jackie turns up, but she tells him that two helpers behind the bar aren't Rodney Bennet at all and they are from Brookdale. Suzanne turns up and is put to use trying to convince Glenroy to share the sound system. Mr Baxter confronts the Brookdale kids when the takings seem low. McClaren works out that Gluxo's been receiving the money, and confronts him intent on emptying his pockets one way or the other. Annette blows her chance with the Rodney Bennet boy she fancies and Nigel's not having much luck. Mrs McClusky dances with Mr McGuffy while both Mr Smart and Mr.Howard are dismayed when Miss Gordon chooses Mr Knowles. Can Pogo's music work its magic for Claire and Stewpot?",

They soon discover the boy is alive and well in school, and the photo shown to the teller had been created on photoshop in a nearby internet cafe. A similar motive for a second robbery soon comes to the surface, but as the detectives close in on the suspect, Jaruszalski finds his life in danger, and a young uniform recruit loses his leg in a deadly explosion. When the case reaches court, DDA's Dekker and Rubirosa attempt to hit a third strike on the accused, after his previous convictions for murder. However, after the case falls flat due to circumstantial evidence, DA Hardin attempts to win the third strike at all costs by attempting to prosecute the robber for the theft of a stolen bike. Dekker must fight his conscience as to whether or not to give the accused the death penalty for a stolen bike.",

They discover that hours prior to the killing, Beth had engaged in sexual activity with two of her co-pupils in a disused mansion just outside the canyon. When the two suspects deny all involvement in the murder, the innocence of Beth's best friend is called into question, as she also appears to have been at the mansion on the night of Beth's death. A trail is soon discovered, and all three suspects admit to raping Beth, but all claim that Beth managed to escape and that none of them are guilty of murder. When the investigation leads to a local paedophile with past convictions of picking up and assaulting girls, DDA's Dekker and Rubirosa are forced to change their strategy when game-changing evidence is discovered at the last minute.

The detectives soon discover that the two dead kidnappers are part of a four-man ring who have travelled over from Moscow to commit a series of similar crimes. As evidence relating to another kidnapping comes to light, the detectives must attempt to find the other victim before she is murdered as well. As the woman is found safe and well, the case is thrown into a totally new light when her husband's fingerprint matches a fingerprint belonging to a Russian spy who had previously infiltrated the White House some ten years previously. DDA's Dekker and Stanton must act quickly to secure a conviction against the kidnappers before his main two witnesses are extradited to Russia by ICE for their part in the infiltration of the White House.

DDA's Dekker and Stanton must act quickly to secure a conviction against the kidnappers before his main two witnesses are extradited to Russia by ICE for their part in the infiltration of the White House. This episode marks the point when the series returns to cases investigated by Winters before his death."

        "Detectives Winters and Jaruszalski investigate when a Chinese woman is found dead by her neighbour. They immediately suspect her boyfriend of the murder after his credit card was used to book a one way train ticket, and his wallet is found in a dumpster just seconds from the train station. However, the detectives make a startling discovery when the boyfriend's body is found beneath his house, killed in a similar fashion to the first victim. The case leads to Prop 128, a ballot which the second victim was campaigning to pass, regarding gay marriage being legal in Los Angeles. The detectives discover that the second victim had come across some irregularities in the voting petitions - which in fact, turned out to be falsified signatures - and that he had been killed under instruction of the ballot's leader, Alan Coregon. DDA's Morales and Price must decide whether to prosecute the murderer or catch Coregon for fraud. DA Hardin urges Morales to strike a deal with both defendants - but to his dismay, Morales attempts to cut a deal on his own terms.",

As such, her boyfriend's father comes under suspicion for Harvey's murder - but just as he is about to stand trial, he is found murdered in his drive.

        "Tucker, Alan and Hughsey mess around at the shopping centre. Trouble seems to be brewing between Brookdale and Grange Hill. Baxter guards the entrance, and notes pupils arriving with injuries. A series of dares begins, each getting more and more dangerous. Are Trisha and Cathy really exhorting money from the first formers? Tucker makes use of the back entrance, selling its usage to other third formers. The precinct is made out of bounds. Sutcliffe catches Cathy and Trisha in the shopping precinct \u2013 but he can't be angry at their reason for being there. Meanwhile at the same time Tucker is pushed into the precinct's fountain as part of a dare. Antoni Karamanopolis takes a daring walk on the car park wall, is this one dare too far?",

        "There are some new faces at Grange Hill and some changes. Annette has moved to Milton Keynes and Ziggy has arrived from Liverpool. Mr Humphries, the headmaster, has disappeared and Zammo has fallen out with Jackie. Imelda plants a frog in someone's crisp packet and creates havoc in assembly. Trevor and Vince nick Ziggy's bag-but it turns out to be Ziggy's. Also, Ant doesn't get on well with his new tutor, Mr Bronson. Caretaker Mr Griffiths catches Danny Kendall smoking and chases after him, but on the way Danny runs into Mr Baxter Mrs. McClusky finds out that the Headmaster has been killed in a car crash. Outside, Ziggy is playing with a spider, explaining that he got his nickname from the Bowie record \"Spiders From Mars\". Imelda arrives and promptly stamps on it and Ziggy pushes her into a fountain.",

        "A school newsletter is being brought out in an attempt to help Miss Partridge. Ant has gone missing after the argument between him and Mr Bronson. Georgina is asked by Mrs McClusky if she knows where he is. E2's math lesson is being covered by Mrs McClusky. Zammo tells Jackie he is over his drug addiction by pouring a packet of drugs down the kitchen sink. Mr Glover visits the school to complain that Julia had her ears pierced during school hours, but Mr Baxter tells him it's not their problem since it was in the lunch hour. Mr Baxter sells Mr Glover a copy of the school magazine and signs him up for the fun run. Miss Booth tries to persuade Danny to make some anti-drug posters, but Danny won't cooperate because the speaking wall was white washed. Jackie tells Zammo's mum that Zammo is over the drugs because he threw his heroin away. However, Zammo's mum's cash card goes missing and she turns up at the school and tells Mrs McClusky she knows Zammo is going to have drugs on him. She asks Mrs McClusky to call the police to catch her son before it goes too far. In the locker room, Zammo and Jackie confront Zammo. Zammo tips out his bag in an order to convince he is clear, but when Jackie picks up his calculator, Zammo gets cross and over-protective of his calculator. Jackie finds a packet of white powder hidden in his calculator. Zammo hits Kevin to stop Jackie tipping out the content and Zammo tries to scoop as much of it up as he can. The police, Mrs McClusky, Mr Kennedy and his mum burst in.",
