        "The work at Gloucester Cathedral was Whall\u2019s largest commission and the work was completed over several years. A final half window was added by his daughter in 1926. The series of windows installed by Whall in the Lady Chapel is acknowledged to be the finest glass of the period in England. First in the series is the \"Fall of Man\" from 1899, showing the Garden of Eden. Central to Whall's scheme are scenes from the life of the Virgin Mary. In the \"Nativity\", shepherds and kings kneel in adoration before Mary and the Christ Child against a snow covered landscape. The rich colours and high quality of painting are typical of his work. In the North side of the Lady Chapel Sanctuary is \"Christ in Majesty\" with the Virgin and Mary Magdalene. This is a stunning example of symbolism in every aspect, with spectacular use of colour. Whall\u2019s glass in the Lady Chapel contains images of many English saints. The detail of St Winifred (1901) includes the line of severance on her neck where she was beheaded and, at the base, the water springing up on the site of her martyrdom. The East window in the Chapter House from 1903\u20131905, is a Boer War Memorial and shows, in the upper centre, Osric, the founder of the first Christian church (about 679 AD) on the Cathedral site. Below, William the Conqueror is depicted, commissioning the Domesday Survey in 1085. The window has many figures representing Discipline, Counsel and Valour. In their book \u201cThe Buildings of England\u201d Gloucestershire 2: The Vale and the Forest of Dean\u201d, David Verey and Alan Brooks write- \u201cWhall\u2019s windows exhibit a dazzling blend of jewel-like colour and drawing of the finest quality. They mostly consist of single figures of saints beneath silvery naturalistic canopies, with small scenes at the bottom, the detail of which repays close examination. He began with the north west window, beneath the bridge chapel 1898-9, then came the two central windows both north and south, completed 1901-2, the south west window, 1902, and the north east of 1909-10. That above the north Chantrey chapel is of 1913: the corresponding window, south, is by his daughter Veronica, 1926; she had assisted her father (who died in 1924) throughout the project\u201d. In the south Chantry the small West window is by Whall and dates from 1921 whereas the South West window is by Veronica and dates to 1929. Some photographs of Whall\u2019s work in Gloucester Cathedral are shown in the gallery below. These include \u201cMan\u2019s Fallen State\u201d, \"Man\u2019s Redemption/Eucharist\u201d and \u201cChrist Enthroned\u201d, all in the Lady Chapel and \u201cChoristers\u201d and \u201cChurch Musicians\u201d which are part of the West window of the South Chantry of the Lady Chapel. These were installed in 1921 to commemorate a former cathedral organist. Several photographs of Whall's Gloucester Cathedral work are shown in the gallery below."

        "Christopher and Veronica Whall , under the name Whall and Whall, were responsible for the memorial window in Worcester Cathedral which remembers Major James Baldwin who died in 1922. Baldwin was a Major in the Worcestershire Yeomanry. The window was installed in 1923 and is a three-light traceried window which depicts the passage of the soul from this earthly life to the heavenly life. The text is from Bunyan's \"The Pilgrim\u2019s Progress\". The left hand light depicts the Archangel Michael as the Angel of Judgement and Spiritual Warfare. The central light has a group of Angels standing in a flowery meadow beyond the river of Death. They carry trumpets and are ready to welcome those who pass from this world. The Archangel Gabriel, the Angel of Reconciliation, appears in the third light, that to the right. The tracery includes the insignia of the units with which Major James Baldwin was associated, the Worcestershire Volunteer Regiment and the Queen\u2019s Own Worcestershire Hussars. In their volume on Worcestershire, Nikolaus Pevsner and Alan Brooks wrote \"Good Arts and Crafts\". Photographs of each individual light are included in the gallery at the end of this listing."

        "Whall competed a two-light window for the Minster. One light covered the \"Crucifixion\" and the second \"An Angel and St John on Patmos\". This window is in the Chapel of Christ the Light of the World. In some notes on two of Whall's sketch designs for these windows, Peter Cormack wrote that Whall's design for a crucifixion window was a good example of his respect for the iron framework to which the panels of stained glass are affixed. He feels that the absence of tracery gives the iron- work a particular prominence, and the upright bars, resembling spears. have an expressive function which Whall exploits in his composition. On the second light Cormack wrote that the subject of the window, the vision of St. John the Divine on the Isle of Patmos, was another of Whall\u2019s favourite subjects \u2013 indeed the Book of Revelations (sic) was a constant source of iconography \u2013 and it features in the window at Burford and, most dramatically, in the designs for Christchurch Priory. In his \"The stained glass of Southwell Minster\" written in 1988, John Beaumont writes- 'The Crucifixion. Whall has shown Our Lord on the cross, surrounded by a glory or mandala. Above the cross beam is seen the mocking label 'INRI' (Jesus of Nazareth king of the Jews). Above his head both the sun and the moon can be seen although the sun is darkened. This was a way of indicating that some great event was taking place, as although the moon can be in the sky at the same time as the sun, it cannot normally be seen in the middle of the day when it is near the sun. On Christ's right hand is his mother, and on his left St John. The words recorded are those of Jesus just before he died 'Woman, behold your son!' and 'Behold your mother!' when he gave his mother into the care of John, the beloved disciple. Apochryphal writings record that Mary stayed in the home of John until her death. (Luke 23.44; John 19.26-28.) Below, the panel depicts the ram caught in the thicket, part of the story of the sacrifice of Isaac. This is a reference to an Old Testament event foreshadowing the sacrifice of Christ on the cross. 'God will provide himself the lamb for a burnt offering, my son'. (Genesis 22.8-14.\" \u2014 quotation from John Beaumont St John on Patmos: Patmos, a sterile island in the Aegean Sea, is where the angel came to John telling him to record his vision, the vision that we can now read as the Apocalypse, the Revelation to St John. John kneels on a sea-bound cliff top to the right of the panel, and is addressed by the angel. Below is shown the Lamb with the book with seven seals and at the apex is an image of the New Jerusalem. (Revelation 1.1; 1.9; 6.1; 21.10.). The Inscription reads- \"In piam memoriam Joannis Noble de Little Over in Com de Darby Arm/ qui apud Kendal in Com de Westmorland die VII Apr AD MDCCCXXVIII natus / die XV Nov AD MDCCCXCVI apud Little Over mortuus est has fenestras dedicavit / filius eius natu maximus Gulielmus Jacobus Noble Templi Interioris Socius\" \u2014 Window inscription Images are shown in the gallery below shown courtesy Mary and Malcolm Stacey."

Hordy instantly bursts the bubble Luffy created with his bubble coral, but Luffy is saved from certain death when Fukaboshi intervenes. Meanwhile, Decken once again offers Shirahoshi his hand in marriage, and upon rejection, releases another barrage of attacks. These are all blocked by Manboshi, Ryuboshi and Hoe. Hordy's Energy Steroids are allowing him to catch up with Luffy and Fukaboshi. Luffy asks to go to the deck of Noah, as there will be air for him to fight there, but Hordy gets there first and stabs Decken to destroy the island."

Sanji and Brook walk by and saw Nami taking a bath so they stare at her. Nami asked Chopper to move aside away from the cloud she made and the cloud electrified Sanji and Brook. Chopper claims he is scared and he won't eat the cloud. Meanwhile Luffy, Zoro, Usopp, Franky and Robin are hanging out. Luffy tells Usopp to hurry up with the fish hook because he wants to catch and eat a big fish. Robin says that Luffy and Usopp are having fun. Franky says he wants Cola with a big fish. Zoro says he wants to have a drink to celebrate entering the New World. Luffy, Zoro, and Usopp sees three big fish. Zoro wants to eat a fried fish with salt. Usopp wants a fish sliced up and grilled. Luffy wants a fish with mayonnaise. Usopp says which fish Luffy wants and claims that it is not edible. Luffy punches the fish with gear second and Usopp uses the fish hook to grab hold of it. The fish that they caught suddenly got ate by a bigger fish and Zoro uses 360 pound cannon killing it. Nami is still in the bath and she claims that the rest of the crew are making too much of a ruckus and they she shouldn't have trusted them in watching the ship for her. They suddenly got caught in a White Storm and Luffy claims it is the wormhole of his dreams and Usopp slaps him for saying that. Nami claims the crew to be stupid for getting into too much trouble while she was taking a bath. They get caught in the White Storm and they try to hang out to something so they won't fly out of the ship. They finally crash into a whale without noticing at first. Brook then claims that the whale is Laboon but they finally see a whole bunch of whales and the others claim that Laboon is not here but in the first half of the grand line. Sanji then says that they need to get out of there and asks Nami about what they should do. Nami says they don't need to do anything and Sanji listened. The Straw Hats asked one of the whales to give them a ride to the surface of the New World. Brook sang a song for the whales so they can bring them to the surface. Before they got to the surface the Straw Hats remembered the times during their training to become stronger so they can regroup and head towards the New World. They finally surfaced and Thousand Sunny hopped off the whales and landed onto the ocean. The Straw Hats say goodbye to the whales and they see some ships claiming they are pirate ships but then they saw that the ships belong to the Marines."

He also designed stained glass for the windows on the North side of the chapel. The chapel was demolished in 1960 but Whall's windows were saved and are now in St Sophia's Episcopal Church in the village of Douglas. The windows depict the coats of arms of the Douglas family from earliest times. The foliage in the lower part of the windows is based on the lyric - The Oak and the Ash and the Bonny Ivy tree, which flourish in my home in the North Countree."

Joseph kneels to kiss the hand of the infant Jesus who is held by Mary. In his Through a Glass Brightly, J Walter McGinty writes \"The supporting roof timbers are a foreshadowing of the cross, while above are the angels and the light from heaven. Outside the stable can be seen, on the right a robin and on the left the garden and tomb, while faintly visible in the distance is a church.\" The window was a gift from Mrs. I. Barr-Smith of South Australia in memory of her parents, Alexander and Christina Mitchell of Sauchrie."
