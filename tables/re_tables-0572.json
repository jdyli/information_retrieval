At this ceremony, Sookie and Alcide discover Russell Edgington, a vampire who employs werewolves to carry out missions for him, supplies this pack with V.

She has a very upbeat talkative personality, loving dolls and show tunes and talking constantly. Hoyt finds it hard to stand her but admits that it is better than being alone. It is something of a visual gag that Summer at 5\"0\" is nearly a foot and half shorter than the 6\"5\" Hoyt.",

        "Luke McDonald is a member of the Fellowship of the Sun depicted as a friend, enemy, and rival of Jason Stackhouse at different points of the second season. Growing up in Odessa, Texas, he signs up to join a training camp for the Fellowship of the Sun (an anti-vampire church) when a knee injury prevents him from joining the military or maintaining a college football scholarship. On the bus ride there, he bonds with Jason Stackhouse, though he later becomes jealous of the amount of attention Jason receives. At camp, Luke tells Jason that the only reason that Sarah likes him is because she wants to sleep with him, making his resentment clear to everyone. Luke is eventually selected to join the Soldiers of the Sun, though his initial performance is poor due to his attempts at out-pacing Jason. Though a bitter animosity grows between the two characters, they make amends when Jason helps Luke climb over a fence he is too exhausted to scale. After the confrontation between Stan's vampires and the Fellowship, it initially appears that Luke has left his position with the Soldiers of the Sun. Later, at Godric's gathering, he arrives with a silver bomb strapped to his chest. After detonating the bomb, he's killed in the explosion along with (according to Isabel) three vampires and two human companions. The character was part of various interactive internet campaigns related to the show; including a fictional blog and YouTube channel.",

During Sookie's telepathic investigation at Fangtasia, when Eric enlists her to help identify who is stealing money from the bar, Ginger is introduced as the last human employee (though her exact job title is never provided). By reading Ginger's repeatedly glamored mind, Sookie is able to learn that a vampire is responsible, prompting Longshadow to attack.

        "Sookie Stackhouse is a telepathic waitress in a small-town restaurant and the protagonist of the series. Because of her ability, she has difficulty forming lasting human relationships. She becomes involved in a romantic relationship with a vampire, Bill, upon discovering that she can't read his mind. This relationship with a supernatural being causes controversy amongst the residents of her small town. Through Bill, she finds herself entering a world of creatures and supernatural conflict that surpasses even her worst nightmares. She has lived with her grandmother, Adele Stackhouse, since childhood, after the death of her parents. After Adele's death, Sookie inherits the home. It is revealed in Season 3 that Sookie is part faerie, a race of supernaturals who are widely believed to have been driven to extinction by vampires, who drained them of their blood to obtain the ability to walk in the sun. The faeries commonly refer to this as \"stealing their light\" and hence have a distinct fear and hatred of vampires. It is from the faeries that Sookie inherited her telepathic powers, magical light and apparently delicious tasting blood. Sookie comes into contact with a community of faeries living in a hidden world in Bon Temps and, after learning of Bill's betrayal at the end of Season 3, joins them in their magical world. She quickly learns their communication with her was a trick to keep all the humans with faery DNA in the faery world. Sookie returns to Bon Temps after a few minutes, only to learn that a year has passed in the human world. Upon discovering a naked, wandering Eric, who had his memory wiped out by Antonia/Marnie, Sookie takes him in. They develop a relationship and Eric gradually falls in love with Sookie. Under Antonia/Marnie's control he tries to kill Bill, but Sookie uses her faerie light to stop him and remove the spell. When Tara, Holly, and the others at the Moon Goddess emporium are held captive near the end of season 4, Sookie brings Jason, Jesus, and Lafayette to save them. Their plan fails and only Jason escapes. The others eventually flee with the help of Sookie's faerie powers and brujo magic from Jesus. Unknown to the group, Marnie uses Lafayette's medium ability to inhabit his body, after which she kills Jesus for his magic and attempts to kill Bill and Eric. Holly creates a safe circle and, with the help of Tara and Sookie, calls for friends, family members, and ancestors from beyond to help them. Sookie sees her Gran, Adele Stackhouse, and confesses she is lost without her. Gran tells her the answer is in her heart, and that there's no fear in being alone. After letting Bill and Eric feed from her to heal them, she breaks off her relationship with both vampires. She returns home where Debbie Pelt, who blames Sookie after being abjured by Alcide, is waiting with a shotgun. Tara jumps in the firing line and is shot in the head, after which Sookie fatally shoots Debbie. Season 5 begins Sookie and Lafayette reluctantly convincing Pam to turn Tara in to a vampire, a decision causes tension between Sookie and vampire hating Tara. Sookie is forced to tell Alcide the truth about his Debbie's death when the Pelt's come to Bon Temps in search of their daughter, but Alcide tells them it was Marcus Bosman who killed their daughter. After drowning her sorrows with alcohol, Sookie is visited by Alcide. He informs Sookie that he lied, meaning she is no longer a suspect in Debbie's death, and she responds by kissing him, oblivious to the fact that Bill and Eric are watching from outside. The two vampires eventually interrupt the couple to reveal that Russell Edgington is on the loose. Sookie uses her faerie power to help them find Russell's hiding place. Having completed her mission with the vampires, Sookie focuses on her family as Jason discovers that their parents were killed by vampires. He takes her to a cloaked faerie nightclub, where Claude reveals it was Sookie's scent, made irresistible by her faerie blood, which drew the vampire to her parents. She attempts to rid herself of her powers, but Jason stops her and convinces her to accept her faerie nature. She is visited by a mysterious Ghost Monster, convincing her to turn to the spirit of her Gran. Adele directs Sookie and Jason towards a scroll hidden under her old bed which the fae help them to decode. Her ancestor promised his first fae bearing female - Sookie- to Warlow, the vampire who killed her parents and appeared to her as the Ghost Monster. After Eric saves the faeries from Russell Edgington, Sookie agrees to help him save Bill, who is locked in religious fervour. Their attempts are in vain, as Bill drinks Lilith's blood and is reborn. The season ends with Eric urging Sookie to run.",

When Tara, Holly, and the others at the Moon Goddess emporium are held captive near the end of season 4, Sookie brings Jason, Jesus, and Lafayette to save them. Their plan fails and only Jason escapes. The others eventually flee with the help of Sookie's faerie powers and brujo magic from Jesus. Unknown to the group, Marnie uses Lafayette's medium ability to inhabit his body, after which she kills Jesus for his magic and attempts to kill Bill and Eric. Holly creates a safe circle and, with the help of Tara and Sookie, calls for friends, family members, and ancestors from beyond to help them. Sookie sees her Gran, Adele Stackhouse, and confesses she is lost without her. Gran tells her the answer is in her heart, and that there's no fear in being alone. After letting Bill and Eric feed from her to heal them, she breaks off her relationship with both vampires. She returns home where Debbie Pelt, who blames Sookie after being abjured by Alcide, is waiting with a shotgun. Tara jumps in the firing line and is shot in the head, after which Sookie fatally shoots Debbie. Season 5 begins Sookie and Lafayette reluctantly convincing Pam to turn Tara in to a vampire, a decision causes tension between Sookie and vampire hating Tara. Sookie is forced to tell Alcide the truth about his Debbie's death when the Pelt's come to Bon Temps in search of their daughter, but Alcide tells them it was Marcus Bosman who killed their daughter. After drowning her sorrows with alcohol, Sookie is visited by Alcide. He informs Sookie that he lied, meaning she is no longer a suspect in Debbie's death, and she responds by kissing him, oblivious to the fact that Bill and Eric are watching from outside. The two vampires eventually interrupt the couple to reveal that Russell Edgington is on the loose. Sookie uses her faerie power to help them find Russell's hiding place. Having completed her mission with the vampires, Sookie focuses on her family as Jason discovers that their parents were killed by vampires. He takes her to a cloaked faerie nightclub, where Claude reveals it was Sookie's scent, made irresistible by her faerie blood, which drew the vampire to her parents. She attempts to rid herself of her powers, but Jason stops her and convinces her to accept her faerie nature. She is visited by a mysterious Ghost Monster, convincing her to turn to the spirit of her Gran. Adele directs Sookie and Jason towards a scroll hidden under her old bed which the fae help them to decode. Her ancestor promised his first fae bearing female - Sookie- to Warlow, the vampire who killed her parents and appeared to her as the Ghost Monster. After Eric saves the faeries from Russell Edgington, Sookie agrees to help him save Bill, who is locked in religious fervour. Their attempts are in vain, as Bill drinks Lilith's blood and is reborn. The season ends with Eric urging Sookie to run.",
        "Sookie Stackhouse is a telepathic waitress in a small-town restaurant and the protagonist of the series. Because of her ability, she has difficulty forming lasting human relationships. She becomes involved in a romantic relationship with a vampire, Bill, upon discovering that she can't read his mind. This relationship with a supernatural being causes controversy amongst the residents of her small town. Through Bill, she finds herself entering a world of creatures and supernatural conflict that surpasses even her worst nightmares. She has lived with her grandmother, Adele Stackhouse, since childhood, after the death of her parents. After Adele's death, Sookie inherits the home. It is revealed in Season 3 that Sookie is part faerie, a race of supernaturals who are widely believed to have been driven to extinction by vampires, who drained them of their blood to obtain the ability to walk in the sun. The faeries commonly refer to this as \"stealing their light\" and hence have a distinct fear and hatred of vampires. It is from the faeries that Sookie inherited her telepathic powers, magical light and apparently delicious tasting blood. Sookie comes into contact with a community of faeries living in a hidden world in Bon Temps and, after learning of Bill's betrayal at the end of Season 3, joins them in their magical world. She quickly learns their communication with her was a trick to keep all the humans with faery DNA in the faery world. Sookie returns to Bon Temps after a few minutes, only to learn that a year has passed in the human world. Upon discovering a naked, wandering Eric, who had his memory wiped out by Antonia/Marnie, Sookie takes him in. They develop a relationship and Eric gradually falls in love with Sookie.

        "Bill Compton is a vampire romantically involved with Sookie. Turned during the American Civil War against his will, Bill shows more compassion for human life than many other vampires. He is outwardly expressive of his emotions and holds onto memories of his past human life, behaviors that are unique amongst his vampire peers. While not an extremely old vampire, Bill is quite powerful and was referred to by Russell Edgington as one of the most promising vampires in the Americas. Bill risks his life and standing in vampire society to protect Sookie from those who wish to take advantage of her fae ancestry. It is revealed in Season 3, and hinted at in Season 2, that Bill's original mission during his return to Bon Temps was to investigate reports of Sookie's fae heritage and deliver her to Queen Sophie-Anne of Louisiana, who planned to drain her blood so she could walk in the sun. Once Sookie discovers this ulterior motive behind Bill's initial interest in her, she banishes him from her life. Shortly after, the Queen arrives at Bill's house in Bon Temps, expecting him to hand Sookie over. When he refuses, the two begin a duel to the death. By making a deal with Nan Flanagan, Bill has the Queen killed by snipers and becomes the new Vampire King of Louisiana. In early episodes it is revealed that Bill had a human wife and two children (Tom and Sarah) before he became a vampire. A short time after being turned Bill returns to his family in his desperation to see them one last time. He discovers that his son has recently died of an illness (pox). Upon seeing his tears of blood at the death of his son his wife becomes hysterical at which point Lorena, Bill's maker, steps in and glamors her before removing Bill from his family forever. The fates of Bill's wife and young daughter, who was not present during his return home, are unclear, although Adele Stackhouse makes reference to the recently deceased previous owner of Bill's family home as the last Compton in Bon Temps. In Episode 4 of the Fourth season, Bill becomes involved in a sexual relationship with Portia Bellefleur (sister of Sheriff Bellefleur) until, upon meeting her grandmother, he realises she is a descendant of his daughter Sarah.",

        "Jason Stackhouse is Sookie's not-too-bright, self-involved brother, who is vigilant in defending and protecting Sookie. He supervises a road crew during the day, and is known for bedding the women of Bon Temps at night. During the first season, he is the prime suspect in the murders of four women, all of whom have a connection to him. After the death of his V-addict girlfriend Amy, he comes to believe that he is responsible for the murders. He is then recruited by the Fellowship of the Sun, an anti-vampire church, who approve of what they believe to be his crime of killing fangbangers. In the second season, Jason briefly becomes an active member of the Fellowship, but later leaves it. In the third season, he develops a relationship with a supernatural creature, Crystal Norris, and thinks of joining the police. Crystal is forced to leave town with her fiance but Jason pledges to find her. Like his sister Jason is also part faerie though he does not appear to have inherited any of the special abilities that Sookie possesses. However, some speculate that his potential faerie \"ability\" is the sexual magnetism that many faeries possess. In fourth season he is a deputy on the Bon Temps police force and caretaker of the were-panthers of Hotshot. He is kidnapped by Felton & Crystal who are now V-addicts, and raped by all the women of the were-panther community after it is believed he is the \"ghost daddy\" meant to revive the dwindling numbers of the genetically weakened inbred pack. He manages to escape Hot Shot + Crystal, and kill Felton in the process, however due to the excessive, untreated bites from attempting to be turned werepanther by the others, he is left on the side of the road badly wounded. He is found by Jessica, where she tells him to \"drink\" and he is healed by her blood. When the witches cast a spell to bring the vampires out into the daylight, Jessica breaks free of her silver bonds and almost burns herself trying to walk out into the sunlight. Jason comes at the last second and tackles her back into the house, closing the door and saving her life. Jason starts having intermittent sexual fantasies about Jessica - some of which involving Hoyt. Jessica and Jason do finally have sex after she breaks up with Hoyt. In the culmination of season 4 when The Moon Goddess Emporium is being held captive by Marnie, Jason tries to save Sookie, Tara, and everyone else inside. When Pam angrily aims a bazooka at the place, and it blows up at the protective barrier Marnie has placed around the emporium, all vampires present (Eric, Bill, Pam, and Jessica) heal quickly - but Jason is left severely burned and blind. Jessica once again offers her blood and saves his life. He admits his feelings to Jessica, and she also admits her own. They agree to have a relationship - but just as friends with benefits. Jessica states that she just got out of her first and only serious relationship, and doesn't want to be tied down to anyone. With the season 5 premiere, Jason is greeted by Rev. Steve Newlin, who admits to Jason he's always had feelings for him. When Jason kindly rejects him, Newlin loses it and tries to bite Jason. Jessica rushes back and says \"Jason is mine\", then threates the Rev. with either leaving Jason alone - or the true death. Jason tries to cope with his feelings for Jessica in their casual relationship, and turns down advances from other girls despite his open relationship status. After running into his high school teacher, who it is revealed to have slept with an underage Jason, he struggles with his inner demons; saying that there is a big hole in him, with something just missing - and he's been trying to fill it with sex, which so far has worked - but now it is not. And he doesn't know how to be friends with a girl. Jessica, who is present for this speech - says that he is already friends with a girl, and that she is there to talk and listen to him. Jason later goes to a secret club with Sheriff Andy and Judge Clements, that is revealed to be a fairy safehouse. When the girl he is with reads his mind, he realized the supernatural aura of the place and then sees his cousin Hadley. She explains that he + Sookie must join her and the other faeries or the vampires will kill them, as they did their parents. Jason, believing his parents died in a flood, tries to get more information from Hadley but gets kicked out of the club with Sheriff Andy and presumably attacked by 2 male faeries.",

In fourth season he is a deputy on the Bon Temps police force and caretaker of the were-panthers of Hotshot. He is kidnapped by Felton & Crystal who are now V-addicts, and raped by all the women of the were-panther community after it is believed he is the \"ghost daddy\" meant to revive the dwindling numbers of the genetically weakened inbred pack. He manages to escape Hot Shot + Crystal, and kill Felton in the process, however due to the excessive, untreated bites from attempting to be turned werepanther by the others, he is left on the side of the road badly wounded. He is found by Jessica, where she tells him to \"drink\" and he is healed by her blood. When the witches cast a spell to bring the vampires out into the daylight, Jessica breaks free of her silver bonds and almost burns herself trying to walk out into the sunlight. Jason comes at the last second and tackles her back into the house, closing the door and saving her life. Jason starts having intermittent sexual fantasies about Jessica - some of which involving Hoyt. Jessica and Jason do finally have sex after she breaks up with Hoyt. In the culmination of season 4 when The Moon Goddess Emporium is being held captive by Marnie, Jason tries to save Sookie, Tara, and everyone else inside. When Pam angrily aims a bazooka at the place, and it blows up at the protective barrier Marnie has placed around the emporium, all vampires present (Eric, Bill, Pam, and Jessica) heal quickly - but Jason is left severely burned and blind. Jessica once again offers her blood and saves his life. He admits his feelings to Jessica, and she also admits her own. They agree to have a relationship - but just as friends with benefits. Jessica states that she just got out of her first and only serious relationship, and doesn't want to be tied down to anyone. With the season 5 premiere, Jason is greeted by Rev. Steve Newlin, who admits to Jason he's always had feelings for him. When Jason kindly rejects him, Newlin loses it and tries to bite Jason. Jessica rushes back and says \"Jason is mine\", then threates the Rev. with either leaving Jason alone - or the true death. Jason tries to cope with his feelings for Jessica in their casual relationship, and turns down advances from other girls despite his open relationship status. After running into his high school teacher, who it is revealed to have slept with an underage Jason, he struggles with his inner demons; saying that there is a big hole in him, with something just missing - and he's been trying to fill it with sex, which so far has worked - but now it is not. And he doesn't know how to be friends with a girl. Jessica, who is present for this speech - says that he is already friends with a girl, and that she is there to talk and listen to him. Jason later goes to a secret club with Sheriff Andy and Judge Clements, that is revealed to be a fairy safehouse. When the girl he is with reads his mind, he realized the supernatural aura of the place and then sees his cousin Hadley. She explains that he + Sookie must join her and the other faeries or the vampires will kill them, as they did their parents. Jason, believing his parents died in a flood, tries to get more information from Hadley but gets kicked out of the club with Sheriff Andy and presumably attacked by 2 male faeries.",
        "Jason Stackhouse is Sookie's not-too-bright, self-involved brother, who is vigilant in defending and protecting Sookie. He supervises a road crew during the day, and is known for bedding the women of Bon Temps at night.

He is assigned to investigate the series of murders that occur during the first season. Throughout the season, Jason Stackhouse is Andy's primary suspect even when evidence doesn't point toward him being responsible. He is suspended from his duties in the second season, but makes a comeback as he claims to have shot Eggs, whom the town believes responsible for murders committed by Maryann. In the third season, he takes over from Sheriff Dearborne and reluctantly trains Jason in being a police officer. For most of Maryann's reign of terror he manages to keep from falling under her influence until the night she is killed by Sam. Andy is one of the few Bon Temps residents who remembers what Maryann had done, although his knowledge of who and what she was appears limited as he was heavily intoxicated a lot of the time. In season 4 he is shown to have an addiction to V \"vampire blood\". It is also revealed in season 4 that his sister Portia is a direct descendant of Bill Compton, this would also mean that Andy too is a direct descendant of Bill's.",

        "Pamela Swynford De Beaufort, commonly referred to as simply Pam, made into a vampire by Eric about a century before the events of the series. She is introduced during the first season as his loyal (albeit lazy) assistant and the bouncer at Fangtasia. Pam is the former madame of a brothel in San Francisco circa 1905, as revealed during the fifth season; it is while she is being attacked by a serial killer that she first meets Eric Northman, who later turns her when she attempts to commit suicide to avoid a future of dying as a lonely pariah (due to her profession as a prostitute.) Cynical and apparently devoid of feelings for anyone except Eric, she is often by his side though she does not accompany him to Dallas in the second season, presumably she was told to run Fangtasia in Eric's absence. After Lafayette is healed by Eric's blood, Pam enlists him to sell V for Eric. Throughout the series, Pam often displays lesbian tendencies and is even seen performing a sexual act on the new female dancer at Fangtasia who later becomes jealous of Pam for her close relationship with Eric. In season three Pam was briefly held captive and tortured by the Magister, who was trying to find out who was selling V though she revealed nothing, further proving her fierce loyalty to Eric. She wept tears of blood when Eric attempted to burn Russell Edgington in the sun and himself in the process. This was the first time she had been seen to show deep emotions. In season four, after she finds out about the incident with Eric and the witches, she goes after them and demands that Marnie removes the spell she cast on Eric. Marnie tries to cooperate at first, but is once again possessed by the witch Antonia's spirit, and casts a spell on Pam to make her face rot, which leaves Pam horrified. She and Eric occasionally speak to one another in Swedish.",

        "Alcide Herveaux is a werewolf who helps Sookie in finding Bill while Bill is held captive by Russell Edgington. He does this to relieve the debt his family owed to Eric Northman. Alcide is one of the few good werewolves introduced thus far. He is handsome and has an ongoing attraction to Sookie. He admits to Sookie early on that he used to be in love with his ex-fiance Debbie, who is a werewolf. She led people to believe she left him because he didn't want a baby, wasn't \"man enough\" and left him for Coot - packmaster of Russell Edgington's alliance of werewolves. At the end of season three, Eric borrows Alcide's truck to help kill Edgington, finally relieving him of his debt to Eric. In Season 4 it is revealed that he is back together with Debbie, who is in a recovery program, and living in Shreveport. He is confronted by the Shreveport pack master Marcus Bosman about not joining the pack. He prefers not to be part of a pack, but when Debbie insists on joining, Alcide relents. He even tells Marcus he's open to moving up in the pack to please Debbie. His relationship with Debbie becomes strained when she senses Alcide might have feelings for Sookie after he saves her life. In addition, Alcide doesn't want the same things that Debbie does, such as a family and being more involved with the pack. Alcide also loses faith in Marcus after Marcus and his friends beat Tommy to death. He and Sam eventually team up to exact vengeance on Marcus. Seeing Marcus in his bedroom with Debbie becomes the last straw for Alcide and after Sam beats up Marcus, Alcide breaks his windpipe with his bare hands to protect Sam and abjures Debbie; a werewolf recognition that one werewolf no longer recognizes the existence of another werewolf. Alcide informs the pack that it was him who killed there pack master Marcus so they would release Sam who they thought had killed Marcus, Alcide covers up the fact that sookie had likked Debbie had they spend the night together. Alcide finds out their new pack master is working for Edgingtion and is giving the pack V Alcide does everything in his power to stop it. Recently Alcide accepted the role of packmaster, a position he never aspired to have. While being packmaster, Alcide was more aggressive and became more of a leader than a lone wolf. He did enjoy the benefits of packmaster, such as control over the pack and have any female pack member he wants. However, even though Alcide inherited the flesh of JD, most of his pack, like Rikki, ignores his commands. Alcide's pack's aggressive behaviour and murder of the students who tried to persuade them to reveal their existence publicly frustrates him. He despises violence and unsuccessfully tries to cover up Nicole's escape. When Rikki confraonts him with Nicole and Nicole's mom capture, proving the packmaster lied to his own pack, Rikki charges Alice with the assistance of two female werwolves but Alcide finishes them off though he restrains from killing them. He then walks away and turn his back on werewolf socienty, befriending Sam Merlotte once again.",

Kiyo realizes that the power Zatch wished for must be the spell's effect. Casting \"Rauzaruk\" again, Zatch is able to defeat all of Kido's clones. Zatch reveals that he wanted power to protect Kiyo. Kiyo realizes that \"Rauzaruk\" increases Zatch's strength, speed, and defense greatly and with that power, they defeat Dr. Riddles and Kido. Dr. Riddles reveals that the latent powers inside Mamodos awaken when they mature spiritually or when the book owner's feelings reach them. Dr. Riddles then tells Kiyo that the evil one is gathering up minions and that Kiyo's help will be needed when the time comes."

In the second season, his church holds Eric's maker Godric, who came to them voluntarily, with the intention of burning him to death publicly.

It is also revealed that vampires killed Newlin's father, who was the previous head of the church.

It is also revealed that vampires killed Newlin's father, who was the previous head of the church. In the third season, he makes recurring appearances on television, especially after Russell Edgington slaughters an anchorman on live television and Newlin sees his chance to call for the death of all vampires once again. An earlier interview with Nan Flanagan reveals Newlin was being investigated by the IRS and apparently going through a divorce seen in the postmortem of the episode \"I Got a Right to Sing the Blues\". In the fourth season episode \"If You Love Me, Why Am I Dyin'?\", it is said that Steve Newlin has been missing for six months. In the final episode of Season 4, it is revealed he has been turned into a vampire as punishment. In the fifth season episode \"Turn! Turn! Turn!\" Newlin confronts Jason and admits he's a \"Proud Gay American Vampire\" and was in love with Jason the whole time. He is brought in by the Authority as the new spokesperson for the AVL, taking Nan Flanagan's place. After the Vampire Authority is destroyed and Governor Burrell's anti-vampire movement is set in motion, Steve Newlin is taken by a new group of vampire police to be studied. When various vampires feed upon Bill to protect themselves against the sun, Eric prevents Steve from doing so. Seeing Sarah opening up a silo to sunlight, Steve uses his last words to proclaim his love for Jason before being burned to death."

        "Tommy Mickens is an illiterate teenage shapeshifter and Sam's younger brother. He has tried to kill Sam, and has stolen from him. He is shocked by the news of having a brother he never knew about and hates him at first, but after spending time with him he begins to enjoy having Sam for a brother to the point that he asks Sam to let him stay with him after a fight with his father. After Sam discovers that his parents have been using Tommy in dog fighting, he lets Tommy move in. He starts working in Sam's bar, but is fired after picking a fight. While working in the bar he shows an attraction to Jessica, even attacking Hoyt in his dog form. He then attempts to steal Sam's money, but Sam angrily shoots him - an injury that is healed in Season 4. At some point during the year separating seasons 3 and 4, Tommy, left with no place to stay, is aided by Maxine Fortenberry who welcomes him to stay at her house. Later Tommy is contacted by his mother, and is abducted by Joe Lee who intends to use him for dog fighting again. Tommy manages to retaliate immediately, and kills Joe Lee and his mother while trying to escape. He then goes to Sam for help, and they both dispose of the bodies in the swamp, to be eaten by the alligators. Bearing out the legend relayed to Sam early in season four, Tommy, having killed his shifter mother, becomes a Skinwalker, complicating Sam's life significantly. In the form of Sam, he fires Sookie and has sex with Luna before kicking her out, prompting Sam to kick him out for good. He then takes the form of Maxine to sell her natural gas rights. He then writes an apology note for Sam on his way out before being confronted by Marcus who is looking for Sam. Tommy shows up to Marcus' shop in the form of Sam and Marcus warns him to stay away from Luna, his ex-wife. Tommy as Sam claims he never touched her, but that his brother did, prompting Marcus and his wolves to beat up Tommy to the point that he reverts to his original form. Alcide then takes Tommy to Merlotte's where Sam meets them. Tommy is about to die from the beating and shape shifting. Sam tries to call for some vampire blood to heal Tommy, but Tommy doesn't want it and makes amends with Sam before dying.",

A member of one of Sam's evening shapeshifter gatherings, Luna reveals that she is a Skinwalker and can take the form of another human being. She is initially reluctant to start a relationship with Sam because her ex-husband, and father of her daughter, is a jealous werewolf, but finally decides she wants to be with him. She is turned off from him after the first night they supposedly have sex when he is extremely rude toward her. She and Sam soon learn that it was actually Tommy, in the form of Sam, that had sex with her. She and Sam finally consummate their relationship on a camping trip with her daughter. When a group of gunmen begin hunting down supes and hurt her and Sam, she sends her daughter Emma to live with her grandmother, Martha Bozeman, until she and Sam deal with the gunmen. During that time, Steve Newlin and Russell Edgington feed the wolfpack with V and when Martha refuses to drink, Russell takes Emma away while from her in wolf form and gives her to Steve as his new pet. Upon discovery of Emma's whereabouts, Sam and Luna sneak into the Vampire Authority to get her back. The plan was to have Luna shapeshift into Steve Newlin as she walks Emma out with Sam following them as a fly when Rosalyn Harris, thinking Luna is Steve, puts her in front of a camera to explain Steve and Russell's actions at a fraternity house that killed 22 people. Luna shape-shifts back to herself on National TV, and Sam kills Rosalyn before she could attack Luna. The pain of shape-shifting back into herself fatally wounds Luna, and tells Sam to take her daughter and hide her from the public and the wolf pack before she dies.",

        "Lorena Krasiki is the vampire who \"made\" Bill. She is first introduced briefly in a season 1 Civil War era flashback when Bill, exhausted and near death after the South's surrender, came to her small house in the woods seeking assistance. Pretending to be a lone widow at the time, she let him in and tried to seduce him. When he refused her advances she attacked him and, after becoming intrigued by him, eventually turned him into a vampire. A lonely yet malevolent being, Lorena quickly becomes emotionally dependent on Bill. Through her influence he becomes a crazed killer and together they revel in the torture of humans before draining them of their blood, often having sex as their victims bleed to death watching. When Bill realizes the monster he has become he forces Lorena to release him and leaves her. The two do not meet again for more than 70 years when, in season 2, she is summoned to the vampire hotel in Texas by Eric who, in his desperation to find Godric, schemes with her to hold Bill captive while Sookie infiltrates the Fellowship of the Sun so that he cannot interfere. Lorena is coerced into Eric's plan. Her love and longing for Bill has intensified over the years and as she holds him captive the two share memories of their twisted past together. Bill eventually escapes after hitting her over the head with a plasma television. Lorena makes an appearance at the party after Godric is freed from the Fellowship of the Sun and challenges Sookie who aggressively defends her relationship with Bill and warns Lorena to stay away from him. When she tries to attack Sookie, she is stopped by Godric who again comments on her old age and how she has not bettered herself over so much time. He then orders her to leave his domain, which she begrudgingly does, but not before an emotional departing with Bill outside. Lorena returns in season 3 when Bill is captured by Russell Edgington. At the time, she appears to have been living as a guest in Russell's mansion. Upon seeing Lorena, Bill becomes enraged and hurls a lamp at her, engulfing her in flames, but she survives. Russell leaves Bill to Lorena and though at first Bill resists her advances, the two end up having violent sex, and he twists her neck 180 degrees. After this he calls Sookie and ends their relationship though he does so only to protect Sookie and delude Lorena into believing he has returned to her. Eventually Bill's deception becomes apparent and she resolves to kill him per instructions from Russell. She spends a lengthy and very emotional time torturing him in the servants' house on the mansion grounds before allowing werewolves to feed on his blood. When Sookie escapes from Russell and bursts into the room to save Bill, Lorena attacks her, but Sookie gets the upper hand and plunges a piece of wood into Lorena's chest, killing her.",

A middle-aged, overweight gay man, he became a vampire shortly after his marriage with his wife fell apart and he became dire for male attention. He believed becoming a vampire would spark the interest of gay males in him, but seems to spend most of his days at home watching television. He is under the illusion Lafayette is genuinely attracted to him, while Lafayette pretends to want Eddie in order to collect his blood. Jason and his V-addicted girlfriend Amy abduct him so as to use him as a V reservoir, but as Jason tries to free Eddie, he is staked by Amy. Eddie briefly reappears in the second season, as Jason has a nightmare involving his mixed feelings about vampires. In season four, Lafayette goes to a witch's coven, and their leader, Marnie, contacts Eddie from the dead who then tells Marnie that he has a rose to give to Lafayette. Stunned, Lafayette abruptly leaves.",

She has a human boyfriend, Hugo, who accompanies Sookie when she infiltrates the Fellowship of the Sun, but is revealed to be a traitor to the vampires. In a conversation with Eric, she describes her interest in Hugo as being like \"a science experiment\", however even after the discovery of Hugo's treachery she admits to still loving him (prompting Godric to reduce his punishment from execution to banishment).

        "Russell Edgington was the main antagonist of Season 3 and secondary antagonist of season 5. A 2,800-year-old vampire, Russell is the vampire king of Mississippi. He was born a Celt, though he speaks in German when angered. It is implied that he allied himself with Hitler during WWII, telling Eric Northman, \"Adolf was right; there is a Master Race...it's just not the human race.\" Though often gentle and polite, he is also shown to be wrathful, manipulative, and somewhat mentally unstable (particularly after the death of his vampire progeny and consort Talbot) not recognizing the power that \"the Authority\" supposedly have over vampires in general, and secretly defying them (as shown when he kills the Magister). His great age means he is much stronger and faster than Eric or Bill (who Russell effortlessly defeats in single combat) or any other being in the show thus far. He can also fly. He abducts Bill in season three in hopes of gathering intel on the queen of Louisiana, who he hopes to marry in order to merge their respective kingdoms. After discovering that Sookie has unusual abilities, Russell takes an interest in her. When Bill is no longer of use to him, he orders Bill's execution, but Sookie thwarts his plans. After Eric kills Russell's consort Talbot in retaliation for Russell murdering Eric's human family centuries ago, Russell becomes hysterical and kills an anchorman on live television to address a statement to the world, in which he announces his view that vampires and humans aren't equals and vampires will rule over them. This has widespread fallout as shown in season 4 with the vampires focusing hard on improving their image. Eric, Sookie and Bill manage to dispose of Russell at the end of the third season by tricking him and burying him underneath concrete. In the season 4 finale it is implied that Russell has escaped the concrete, when Alcide finds a mysterious hole in a parking garage floor with silver chains discarded near it. In season 5 it is revealed that he was released from concrete by Salome, to serve her agenda. He managed to kill Roman, the Magister of the Authority and escape once more. He goes against the Authority again when his proposition to drain all faeries in order to gain the ability to walk in sunlight is rejected. He was staked by Eric Northman in the finale of Season 5.",

Marnie Stonebrook is a local shop-owner and palm-reader, and leader of the Wiccan coven to which Holly Cleary and Jesus Velasquez belong. A timid character, she comes under the influence of the spirit of Antonia, whose great power allows her to raise a bird from the dead. Seeing an apparent necromancer as a threat to vampires, Bill Compton sends Eric Northman to break up the meetings, but Antonia possesses Marnie to cast a spell on him wiping Eric's memories. Marnie is unsure how the spell worked, but attempts to reverse it under pressure from Pam. When Pam, impatient, becomes menacing, Antonia again inhabits Marnie, and casts a spell on Pam, disfiguring her. Marnie's students quickly abandon her as a result. Bill has Marnie captured and imprisoned in his mansion, but she admits while glamored that she has no idea how to reverse either spell. She is then fully taken over by Antonia, who plans to kill all vampires. Tara runs into her walking down a road while waiting for Pam to attack her, and they band together to get revenge on vampires. Antonia gathers the coven of Wiccans to fight against the vampire race. When the battle becomes too extreme, the others want out but she forces them to stay. After the massacre of the Tolerance Festival, Antonia is disheartened by seeing innocent casualties and leaves Marnie's body, but Marnie convinces her to rejoin her as collateral damage is to be expected, revealing a shift in her attitudes. After Marnie cold bloodedly kills a member of the coven Antonia wants out, but Marnie puts a binding spell on her drawing her back in. Jesus performs a ritual to free Antonia's spirit from Marnie. Bill shoots Marnie, killing her. However, Marnie's spirit appears before Lafayette and enters his body. She kills Jesus to steal his power and then tries to burn Eric and Bill at the stake. With the help of Holly, Sookie and Tara, the spirits of Antonia and Adele appear and convince Marnie it is time to leave the realm of the living, which she does.",

Marnie Stonebrook is a local shop-owner and palm-reader, and leader of the Wiccan coven to which Holly Cleary and Jesus Velasquez belong. A timid character, she comes under the influence of the spirit of Antonia, whose great power allows her to raise a bird from the dead. Seeing an apparent necromancer as a threat to vampires, Bill Compton sends Eric Northman to break up the meetings, but Antonia possesses Marnie to cast a spell on him wiping Eric's memories. Marnie is unsure how the spell worked, but attempts to reverse it under pressure from Pam. When Pam, impatient, becomes menacing, Antonia again inhabits Marnie, and casts a spell on Pam, disfiguring her. Marnie's students quickly abandon her as a result. Bill has Marnie captured and imprisoned in his mansion, but she admits while glamored that she has no idea how to reverse either spell. She is then fully taken over by Antonia, who plans to kill all vampires. Tara runs into her walking down a road while waiting for Pam to attack her, and they band together to get revenge on vampires. Antonia gathers the coven of Wiccans to fight against the vampire race. When the battle becomes too extreme, the others want out but she forces them to stay. After the massacre of the Tolerance Festival, Antonia is disheartened by seeing innocent casualties and leaves Marnie's body, but Marnie convinces her to rejoin her as collateral damage is to be expected, revealing a shift in her attitudes. After Marnie cold bloodedly kills a member of the coven Antonia wants out, but Marnie puts a binding spell on her drawing her back in. Jesus performs a ritual to free Antonia's spirit from Marnie. Bill shoots Marnie, killing her. However, Marnie's spirit appears before Lafayette and enters his body. She kills Jesus to steal his power and then tries to burn Eric and Bill at the stake.

        "Macklyn Warlow is the vampire who attacked and killed Corbett and Michelle Stackhouse and was the main antagonist of season 6. This mysterious figure, whose face remained covered, seemingly has the ability to manifest himself as a semi-transparent entity and is also part faerie as seen from his telepathy and ability to fire faerie energy beams and walk in sunlight. A contract was made between Warlow and one of Sookie's ancestors granting him the first Fae-bearing female. When Sookie's parents wouldn't give her to him, Warlow killed them and was sent to another dimension by Claudine, as the Faerie Elder tried to do with Russell Edgington. Warlow, as stated in the Book of the Vampyr, is one of the progenies of Lilith herself. Lilith chose Warlow because she believed he could save the vampire race. However, resentful for turning him, he uses his faerie powers to kill her. As such, he has outlived his Maker by untold millennia, and was active in some form well into the Common Era. His name is known to those who have studied the Book of Lilith, but he remained a somewhat mysterious figure even to Lilith's most ardent followers. He managed to escape the faerie realm, and is found by Sookie on her way to work where he was on the ground in pain, supposedly having been attacked by a vampire the night before, going under the name Ben Flynn. Believing him to be a fellow faerie, she lets him rest in her home and directs him to the faerie nightclub before he leaves. He comes across Niall Brigant and offers to help Niall find Warlow, and is once again brought back to Sookie's house where he's assigned to protect her. Upon Jason and Niall's discovery that Ben is Warlow, they attempt to kill him, only for him to overpower them. Sookie discovers that Ben is Warlow, she attempts to feed him food poured with colloidal silver, but fails. He attempts to court Sookie and she forces him out of her house with her faerie light in the middle of foreplay. Warlow tries to explain he was trying to save Sookie from her parents, who were attempting to kill her to protect her from Warlow. Lilith's blood allows Bill to recognize him as Lilith's progeny. Warlow's faerie/vampire blood is stable enough for vampires to walk around in the daylight so Bill asks the creator of Tru Blood to help synthesize it. Sookie realizes Warlow was right about her parents when her father's spirit possesses Lafayette and attempts to kill her again. Warlow is set free by Bill to save her, who in turn transports him to the Faerie realm to keep him out of Bill's reach. Warlow explains he wants to make her his faerie/vampire bride so they will only need to feed off each other for eternity, and Sookie develops feelings for him. When Sookie asks Warlow to help her save her and Bill's friends, Warlow demands that he become hers. After much consideration, Sookie ultimately decides to give herself to him, being resentful toward her parents after they tried to kill her twice. However, when Sookie brings Bill to Warlow, they find him having been attacked by Eric, who is angry at Bill for not having brought Warlow to save Nora. After Bill saved the other vampires by allowing them to drink the blood sample he drank earlier, Sookie tells Warlow she wants to take things slow and introduce Warlow to her friends and family first. Warlow grows angry and tries to forceably turn Sookie. Bill, Jason, and others rescue Sookie and take her back to her house. Warlow follows and defeats all who stand in his way. Before he is able to drain Sookie, Niall escapes from the dimension Warlow trapped him in and holds the faerie/vampire hybrid long enough for Jason to stake him, killing Warlow. Warlow's death caused all who drank his blood to lose the ability to walk in daylight.",

        "Jackson Herveaux is Alcide Herveaux's father and was a packmaster at one point a long time ago. Now he lives in a trailer home in Jackson, Mississippi. When Martha Bozeman brings Rikki Naylor to his trailer home for help after she OD'ed on V, he injects silver into her to force the V out of her system. He helps his son take back the pack from J.D. by giving him a vial of V. After Alcide kills J.D., Jackson becomes a member of the pack, and appears to be Alcide's second, instead of Rikki. Throughout Alcide's journey to find Sam and Nicole, he tries to get him to understand that he needs to do what is right, not what's good for the pack. With this information, Alcide decides to let Sam and Nicole go. Alcide drops his dad off at his trailer, thanking him for his help, and Jackson leaves Alcide to deal with the pack on his own.",

Hence, she will suffer from guilt until she will not have the will to live anymore. Sherry orders Zofis to erase Koko's memory but refuses.

        "Hoyt Fortenberry is Jason's best friend, who works on the road crew. Sweet and good-hearted, he is the only person whose thoughts are consistently kind when Sookie eavesdrops and is unprejudiced against vampires. He is extremely shy around women, and takes the prospect of forming a relationship seriously. For the majority of the first season he is bossed around by his mother, but eventually stands up to her. In the second season, he begins a relationship with Jessica, a newly turned vampire and Bill Compton's vampire-ward. He breaks up with her after she attacks his mother, but they rekindle their romance during the third season and are shown to be living together in the fourth season. Hoyt breaks up with Jessica due to her difficulties having a normal relationship and her growing feelings for Jason, though he is unaware of the latter. After Jessica has a night with Jason, Hoyt leaves her and goes on a self-destructive streak, almost allowing himself to be drained dry by a vampire and joining a hate group. Although initially enthusiastic, when the group tries to get him to kill Jessica, Hoyt finds that he cannot move beyond the theoretical and actually act on the group's ethos, instead freeing Jess and calling the police. The group then tries to kill him, but the police arrive in time with help from Sam and Luna. Having finally had enough, Hoyt takes a job in Alaska, meaning to start a new life. Before he leaves, he has a final sit down with Jason and Jessica, and after forgiving them, nonetheless asks Jess to use her glamor to remove his memories of the both of them, so that he can move on. She tearfully does so. As he leaves town, Jason pulls him over and begs him not to go, but Jess's glamor has worked and he treats Jason as a stranger. As Hoyt drives off to Alaska, oblivious, Jason breaks down at the loss of his friend. Later on, at Terry's funeral, Maxine Fortenberry tells Sookie Hoyt is doing well and is dating a normal woman.",

Zarchim reveals that they were fighting a clone and reveals himself. He prepares to use his strongest spell to defeat Aleshie. Riya attempts to intercept it but fails to. As the attack reaches Aleshie, Ted appears in \"Top Gear\" and intercepts the attack and proceeds to attack Zarchim. Zarchim gravely injured by Ted, flees from the battlefield. Jido and Li-en reunite with Kiyo's group and they continue their infiltration of Faudo."
