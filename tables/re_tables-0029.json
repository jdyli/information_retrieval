The problem with this root is that the \n ts \n consonant tends to greatly complicate the forms of the derivatives (due to \n alveolarization \n ), and it has been felt wise in this table to use a verb root with more neutral sounds. Note that the \n e \n in \n  \n -qet- regularly undergoes \n vowel raising \n when followed by certain vowels and consonants, but this is a simpler and more predictable phenomenon than the various complications brought on by the \n ts \n consonant. Compare this with the situation in \n Arabic \n where the verb \u0641\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0644\u064e (Fa\u02bfala \"he did\") traditionally used to indicated the various verb forms often confuses non-native learners due to the \n \u02bfAin \n \u0639 sound being confused with that of the \n Hamza \n \u0621 that appears in some forms (such as the causative stem IV \u0623\u064e\u0641\u0652\u0639\u064e\u0644\u064e\u064e 'Af\u02bfala).",

As many as seven blasts were triggered by the Maoists to demolish the school building. Sources said Maoists had earlier threatened the school management to stop allowing SF personnel, who used the school as camps during the anti-Maoist operations, to stay there. Still, the SFs again camped at the school for the third phase of the Assembly election that concluded on 8 December. After they left the building a couple of days back, 50 armed Maoists came to the school at around 11pm (IST) and detonated the landmines. Before leaving, they put up posters on the walls of the school, describing the explosion as revenge taken by them against Police personnel using schools as a camp. Another school was blown up in the Kawal village of Palamau District. Maoists also blew up a small bridge near Kahkula and Seriyar villages in the same District.",

At the White House, Ethan reveals to Olivia her failure to destroy the audio recording. With Agent Pierce behind him, Ethan confronts Olivia and gives her the option of admitting the truth to her mother on her own. Alan Wilson, the mysterious man at the head of the conspiracy responsible for the terrorist attacks as well as Michelle's death, finally decides to meet Tony in person. Tony reveals to Jack that his plan all along was to get revenge for the death of his wife. As Wilson arrives and meets Tony and Cara, FBI agents invade the complex. Bowden and Wilson flee from the scene, but Tony catches them. He kills Bowden, and savours the moment when he has Wilson at his mercy. Tony reveals to Wilson that in killing Michelle, he had also killed his unborn son. Jack and Renee arrive to stop Tony from killing Wilson; Tony is furious as he is dragged away. Wilson, now in custody, denies all involvement, prompting Renee to take drastic measures to keep him from getting away with his crimes. At the White House, Olivia confesses to her mother and father.

In the meeting they warned that Tribal Welfare Minister P. Balaraju and his supporters would be dealt with severely. They also wanted the people to make the tenth anniversary of PLGA commencing on 2\u20138 December, a success and advised them not to allow sale of liquor in their villages. Then the Maoists blocked entry into Lothugedda by cutting trees and placing them on either side of the road. They went to the house of Bosetti Durga Rao, a trader, brought out his furniture and other articles and set them ablaze along with a motorcycle and a van. The Maoists whisked away 16 rice bags and other food material and a TV set from the house of Durga. They later smashed a belt shop, set ablaze the bike of a Forest Ranger and partially destroyed a Forest check-post.",

According to Koraput SP Anup Sahu it was suspected that the tribal youth had been murdered on the last day of PLGA week to use terror tactics to compel tribal youths of remote areas join the violent fold. Huika had refrained from joining the controversial CMAS in Narayanpatna area. Huika had even allegedly refused to take part in meetings and rallies of CMAS. \"So, the only reason behind the murder was to create a reign of terror in the area,\" Sahu said.",
