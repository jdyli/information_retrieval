The main conflict is Robert losing rehearsal time due to spending an hour mending his relationship on the phone. Diddy is stumped at elimination and does not cut anyone due to the excellent performances, to the surprise of all.

So during their routine, he tells his fellow members that he will no longer be continuing on with them on their journey. While dancing solo, Julius hears a pop. He is taken to the hospital and told he has a sprained ligament. At eliminations, Donnie questions Diddy's decision on putting him in the \"can't dance group\", but surprisingly makes the cut. Diddy gets upset when he has to make his cut because he realizes that Laurie Ann didn't follow his orders to have the guys rehearse all weekend instead of just for eight hours the day of the cut.

The boys get a new choreographer named Jamal, and they seem to like him better than Laurie Ann because he actually breaks the dance steps down slowly until each guy gets it. Julius is still frustrated about his leg injury, because there is an upcoming elimination that will include dancing, and he is forced to sit in the dance studio while the other guys learn new choreography. Donnie is also stressed about his dancing because last week Diddy stated that he can't dance at all, but Jamal says it's just in his head; don't let what other people say about white boys get to your head, and he appreciates the support from his new dance coach. He later receives dance tips from Qwanell and Carlos, which seems to have helped him boost his confidence immensely. We learn Carlos' fiancee is pregnant, but he later receives news that their baby might be born with down syndrome. As the guys get ready for elimination night, Donnie puts on an outfit, asking one of the other guys if this outfit made him look more of a dancer. They go to Spotlight to perform for Diddy, who will be basing tonight's information on dancing, singing, performance, improvement, determination, and their past weeks here in New York. Carlos' group is first to perform, and Diddy quickly stops the dancing performance and asks the group to sing again because he doesn't think Carlos gave his best. They dance again, and he still doesn't look satisfied. Carlos can't balance his personal problems with the competition, even though he says he wants this more than anything. When Julius's group performs their dance routine, Julius is having trouble with the dance because he hasn't practiced nearly enough as his group members, and Diddy again asks his group to redo it. When Donnie performs his choreography with his group, he states that he believes what Diddy said was just a test, because if Diddy thought he couldn't dance at all, why wouldn't he have just cut him right away? He believes Diddy did it to get him to work twice as hard as his band mates, and wants to prove him better than the guys that already left and the guys still here. Diddy seems to like his group's performance, especially Big Mike because he looks like he's enjoying dancing for Diddy. When it is time to individually perform vocally, Carlos and Julius both struggle; Diddy asked Carlos if he even knew the words of the song, and Julius began to fumble more and more as he performed. In the end, only Julius and Carlos were cut. The guys were then told to go home for two months and come back looking like superstars. Choice of Group (when looking over head shots, in episode 7) Diddy tells each judge to pick their group. This is the result: Bivins: Robert, Willie, Michael, Donnie Cox (producer): Robert, Willie, Brian A., Donnie Slam: Robert, Jeremy, Brian A., Qwanell Ankh Ra (Vocal coach): Robert, Jeremy, Brian A., Qwanell Jamal (choreographer): Robert, Willie, Donnie, Qwanell"

DeAngelo comes back with his braces fully removed, and Mike \"Big Mike\" comes back with a brand new look and in much better shape. The guys reveal what they did over their break as some reveal they performed, worked on their voices, and took dance classes. The guys meet back up in the same park where they are informed that they will be performing at the Beacon Theater where they will open up for New Edition in front of a sold out crowd. The guys go to meet Ankah to practice their songs and work on their voices and are put into two groups. One group is called 5th City and the second group is called Flo. The guys are introduced at the concert by Slam and immediately the show begins. After the performance the groups are rated by the crowd with the crowd cheering the loudest for Flo. The remaining 10 people receive information that they will receive makeovers and be featured in a Sean John photo shoot. After the photo shoot the guys leave to meet Diddy for the final cut. Diddy and his entourage meet in a room to deliberate on people who could possibly make the band and he reveals his feelings towards certain people and his ideas, until he tells the camera man to turn the camera off. At the final meeting place where the guys meet Diddy who has surprisingly arrived before them are told to stand in line against the wall. Diddy begins by calling people out and making them stand in line and sending people back and forth rearranging the group until he calls for music. He tells them to sing. After all the guys sing they are immediately shocked by Diddys walking out of the room without saying anything. The episode comes to a close with a message from Diddy telling everyone he needs help deciding who the group should be. He encouraged all viewers to log onto the MTV website and vote for their favorite finalist, with the results to be revealed on the live finale."

Afterwards the band was finally made and Robert, Willie, Qwanell, Brian Andrews, and Mike were called to be in the band.

She goes on to say that Index is a dear friend and that she hadn't intended to hurt her during her earlier attempt to secure Index as she was unaware of the damage T\u014dma made to Index's magical garb. Since the entire Index-Librorum-Prohibitorum takes up 85% of Index's memory, the remaining 15% needs to be regularly erased each year to save Index from straining her mind with unnecessary memories. With only three days left before the limit is reached, Kaori again demands T\u014dma to hand Index over since she won't recall him. T\u014dma refuses, instead asking Kaori why she doesn't explain everything to Index. However, the question enrages Kaori, who reveals how she and Stiyl tried everything to ensure Index would remember them, but with each successive failure, it became unbearable to see her smile. T\u014dma criticizes them for not considering Index's own feelings each time her memories were erased and questions why Kaori became strong and who she wishes to protect. T\u014dma wakes up three days later in Komoe's apartment in the care of Index; when Stiyl and Kaori arrive, Index tries to protect T\u014dma by promising to do as they ask.",

During the last day of summer vacation, he is approached by a younger Misaka clone capable of showing emotions, who introduces herself as \"Last Order\" and begins to follow him around, much to his annoyance. Because she is hungry, Accelerator takes Last Order to a restaurant and sees Ao Amai, a former researcher for \"The Sisters\" project, but does not pursue him. As Last Order eats, she converses with Accelerator on the Sisters and how she believes that Accelerator was an unwilling participant of the Level 6 Shift project. Tired of her comments, Accelerator leaves her at the restaurant to confront Yoshikawa, a researcher in charge of the Level 6 Shift project. She informs him that Last Order was not created for the Sisters project but for administrating the Misaka Network and that Ao Amai injected a virus into Last Order, which could spread to the other Misakas and cause them to go berserk and attack humans. To stop the virus, she gives Accelerator the choice of finding Ao Amai to explain how to stop the virus or returning Last Order to her incubator. Accelerator chooses the latter.",

Frustrated with not being able to answer Jin's questions, she runs away from him and disappears. Jin consults with Suzushiro about Nagi and Suzushiro thinks that Nagi may be uncertain about her own identity, especially whether she is really a god.
