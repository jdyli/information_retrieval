        "DI Tolin goes to the scene, where the office in charge of the investigation is Insp. Ann Stallwood. Tolin and Stallwood had a relationship a year earlier, which went sour and seems related to events linked to Tolin's having taken leave. The backstory of Danny Rampton, driver of a white van, indicates he is transporting something illegal, and dealing with shady characters.

Soon after the operation he begins to see a ghostly woman in the hospital. After he returns home she reveals herself to be an alien named Kyra who has been stranded on Earth and wishes to go home. Patrick's aide Louise is told by the doctors that the drug that cured his blindness was manufactured in space and can also enhance his senses. Mike Warden, a scientist from British Intelligence working for the NSA has been using the drug iridium, used in treating stroke victims in order to see Kyra. The next day Kyra meets Patrick in the woods and gives him an electric shock which allows him to hear and feel her as well. After a few weeks (wherein they make love) Louise is told by Mike and Patrick's doctor that they wish to investigate Kyra's origins and possibly send her home. Patrick and Kyra know she will be in danger if the doctor's are allowed near her. In a lab Patrick acts as an intermediary between the scientists and Kyra. It is revealed that Kyra is a pacifist alien from a neutron star out of our reach. The scientists trap her in magnetic field causing her great pain. Despite some of the scientists and Patrick's pleas to stop Mike asks to continue the experiment. Knowing that they will never help her Patrick fakes Kyra's death and unplugs the magnetic field, releasing her. Patrick is given the last iridium on Earth and goes to the woods to destroy it. Kyra appears and tries to stop him as it would mean he will never see again but Patrick proceeds and is soon caught by Mike and the police. At the end Patrick is seen giving a lecture, blind again.

It is revealed that Kyra is a pacifist alien from a neutron star out of our reach. The scientists trap her in magnetic field causing her great pain. Despite some of the scientists and Patrick's pleas to stop Mike asks to continue the experiment. Knowing that they will never help her Patrick fakes Kyra's death and unplugs the magnetic field, releasing her. Patrick is given the last iridium on Earth and goes to the woods to destroy it. Kyra appears and tries to stop him as it would mean he will never see again but Patrick proceeds and is soon caught by Mike and the police. At the end Patrick is seen giving a lecture, blind again. Kyra visible only to the episode's viewers, touches his cheek softly.",
        "The episode begins as Patrick, a blind humanities professor, volunteers to undergo a medical operation that will allow to see for the first time since childhood. Soon after the operation he begins to see a ghostly woman in the hospital. After he returns home she reveals herself to be an alien named Kyra who has been stranded on Earth and wishes to go home. Patrick's aide Louise is told by the doctors that the drug that cured his blindness was manufactured in space and can also enhance his senses. Mike Warden, a scientist from British Intelligence working for the NSA has been using the drug iridium, used in treating stroke victims in order to see Kyra. The next day Kyra meets Patrick in the woods and gives him an electric shock which allows him to hear and feel her as well.

        "Senator Wyndom Brody has just won the New Hampshire primary and he's flying to South Carolina to press his campaign for the Presidency. He aims to have all the private details of America's citizens accessible via computers. Suddenly, a woman appears and foretells his death on the plane. She appears intermittently and reveals that she is a traveler from a new golden age in the future created by the future President Wyndom Brody. She can only project herself to him, so no-one else can see her. As another time traveler had visited him several minutes before he entered the plane to personally meet him, the future was changed. She explains that the plane left slightly later and thus was struck by lightning and crashed, killing him. Thus a new darker Orwellian future is created by his opponent. She says that if he jumps from the plane before the lightning strikes, she will save him, returning everything to normal. As the clock begins to tick, Wyndom becomes increasingly erratic until he takes his bodyguard's gun and opens the hatch window to escape. As he falls to the ground, he is suddenly transported to the street below unharmed. The time traveler appears and tells him that he actually created the dark future and her mission was to prevent it from happening. He asks why he was saved and she remarks, \"Saved you?

When he gets there, he discovers that Peter is dead and his wife Eilleen has been charged with his murder. But that's not the only shock awaiting Scott. The town where he grew up has been transformed. Antenna towers dot the landscape and the people act strangely, as if they are under some kind of sporadic mind control. Scott goes to the jail to visit Eileen, where she warns him about the towers\u2014just moments before grabbing the Sheriff's gun and killing herself. This turn of events convinces Scott that he needs to investigate further. He meets with a former colleague of Peter's, Dr. Jim Holbrook, who seems friendly, but doesn't give Scott any information. Scott doesn't know where to turn next, when out of the blue, one of Peter's former students shows up. She tells Scott about a book that holds the secret to what is known as Project Halford. Scott finds the book and a videotape that reveals the Army's plan to construct a neural computer network that would communicate directly with the brain. It also reveals that the project spun out of control and that Peter stole vital codes in an attempt to halt the computer's drive to take over the minds of the townspeople. Sadly Scott was too late and the towers are placed all over the nation, including near his home. Scott's wife is already under their control and shoots Scott.",

        "Astronaut Joseph Reardon lands on Earth, only to find it barren wasteland. He meets Andro, a grotesque creature who reveals that it is the year 2148, almost 200 years in Reardon's future. Andro explains he is one of the few survivors of a biological disaster created by a scientist named Bertram Cabot, Jr. Reardon realizes he needs to see if he can return to his own time, taking Andro along to show the future and perhaps avoid it. While traveling through the time rift, Reardon mysteriously vanishes, leaving Andro alone in trying to prevent his disastrous future from occurring. Andro is able to hypnotize anyone into seeing him as a normal human and begins searching for a way to stop Cabot's work, even if it means killing him. It becomes clear that he gone too far back in time. Bertram Cabot Jr. hasn't been born yet, and in fact his parents Noelle and Bertram Sr. are still engaged. Andro unsuccessfully tries to convince Cabot that he should not marry Noelle. Andro begins to fall in love with Noelle himself. When Andro tries to shoot Cabot, he hesitates and is captured. His true appearance is discovered and he flees the scene. Noelle follows him and he explains his desperate mission. Noelle confesses that she has fallen in love with Andro. She convinces him to take her back to the future, avoiding any possibility that she and Cabot will have a child. Unfortunately Andro disappears just as the ship arrives in \"his\" time.",

The post's doctor (Merrill) uses a unique mind probe in an attempt to understand what is driving the officer mad. When an unexpected earthquake causes the probe to malfunction, the minds of the doctor and the officer are switched. This switch enables the insane officer to set off the atomic device in the guise of the doctor, while the real doctor is confined to a padded cell."

Oddly, the guard slips them a matchbook on which he has scrawled, \"NORCO is doomed.\" When the brothers leave an energy explosion causes the guard to disintegrate. The next day Stuart meets his boss, lead scientist Dr. Block, and shows him the note, which Block dismisses. Block leaves Stuart in the laboratory with Dr. Stephanie Linden. Linden directs Stuart into an adjacent room and locks him in, allowing the energy entity to attack him. Days later, when Stuart does not return, his brother Jory grows worried. However, when Stuart does show up the two men fight, and Stuart falls in the bathtub, where he is electrocuted. It shows that Stuart was wearing a pacemaker that he did not have when he started working NORCO. Investigating the death, police Sgt. Siroleo confronts Block at NORCO. However, Linden is the one who reveals the truth: an entity made entirely of energy was accidentally created. It can consume anyone just be touching them. It is so threatening that those get too close to it inevitably die of fright. Dr. Block found a way to control the entity and is keeping it contained while he studies it. When the other scientists demanded its destruction, Block has them frightened to death. He then restored them to life with pacemakers, which will stop working if Block directs his creature to touch them. Dr. Block reappears with a gun and, holding Siroleo and Linden at bay, releases the entity. Siroleo, however, gets the gun away from Block and shoots him.

Forty years later, an eloping couple arrive at the now-decayed home and rent a room from the eccentric owner. The young couple also disappears, as does the bride's father while searching for his missing daughter. All have been transported into an alternate dimension. They are imprisoned there by a monstrous alien, who offers to free them if they will help lure other victims into the trap, part of the creature's plan to conquer our universe.",

        "Karl Durand is a man in his 30s, but with the mind of a child. Dr. Jacob Valerian discovers a method for transferring memories and experiences into another person's brain. As his last dying act, he transfers his own memories into Karl's brain. Karl begins to have flashes of skill and talent from absorbing the doctor's memories. When he accidentally kills another man, he uses the device to transfer the man's memories into his own brain. However, this causes Karl to exhibit multiple personality and schizoid behavior. Meanwhile he tries to date a woman he's secretly loved for years, with no success, and is forced to kill and \"absorb\" the detective investigating about the death of the man Karl accidentally killed. Finally he absorbs the mind of an artist that the woman had a fling with hoping that his personality helps him to finally get her to love him. The artist was temperamental and suicidal. The ending sequence shows Karl kneeling on the floor going crazy with a gun pointed to his head. The final scene shows a photo of Rose with Karl apparently committing suicide off-camera.",

        "A high-profile and powerful public figure, Graham's position allows him to offer the opportunity to clone their deceased son. Rebecca is at first horrified and repulsed, but eventually agrees to undergo the procedure. After six months, strange things happen. Rebecca begins seeing things from her son's eyes. She meets with Dr. Cole and tells her of the episodes. They both conclude that the child she is carrying is not just a clone, but has the memories of her dead son, Justin. She also realizes that her baby reacts strangely whenever she is around her husband Graham. As she sees through the baby's eyes, she can see the moment of Justin's death, and it doesn't line up with what she had been told. Although Justin did die in an accident, Rebecca's husband, busy with some project, lost patience when the boy wanted attention, and brutally pulled a toy from Justin's hands, accidentally knocking him down; the boy fell and struck his head, and died in the hospital later. She decides to leave, since her husband lied, but Graham tries to convince her to give him a second chance. Images communicated from Justin make her fear that Graham will attempt to kill her and make it look like an accident rather than allow her to leave him knowing his secret (a high-profile divorce, especially if she reveals the truth about what happened to their son, could ruin him), so she hides in the attic. She finds a shotgun up there, and when Graham approaches her, she shoots him (it is left ambiguous as to whether he truly intended to harm her). After three months, Rebecca has brought her newborn son in for a checkup. (There is no explanation as to what occurred after Graham's death or what legal ramifications, if any, Rebecca faced for killing her husband.) When she leaves on the elevator, we see Dr. Cole, now pregnant, and -- responding to a kick \u2014- she calms the unborn child, calling his name: Graham.",

He tries, unsuccessfully, to keep up with everyone else by using a long-forgotten skill: reading books. For the human race, the Stream has been erroneously programmed to crave information instead of knowledge. Soon, it begins to turn the human race into its slaves to attempt to locate and process every single bit of information, a process that will lead to the human race's extinction as people stop doing everything to obtain the desired information.

The Stream will not allow itself to be shut down, however, and it commands the humans under its control to defend itself from Ryan. In the end, Ryan succeeds in shutting down the Stream and saving mankind. Cut off from the mental crutch humanity has used for so long, Ryan finds himself needing to teach mankind the old ways of acquiring information again\u2014from books."

One woman, Prisoner 98843, dares to challenge the authority of the Commandant. Her desire to be free is pitted against the seemingly invincible alien New Masters. All the prisoners believe the world outside the camp is uninhabitable by humans. Prisoner 98843 discovers that the Commandant and the guards are androids who have received no maintenance for decades and are in desperate need of repair. She mends them from spare parts gleaned from other guards that have ceased to function, and finally forces the Commandant to reveal that the rocket fuel made in the camp is no longer in use by the alien fleet, which has moved beyond Earth. He has received no communication from his superiors for decades, and has maintained the camp regimen simply because those were his orders. She leads a revolt that overpowers the guards and beheads the commandant. The episode ends with the inmates looking through the open gates at a virgin Earth.",

        "The Innobotics corporation, first seen in \"Valerie 23\", has decided that sexual companion robots are too dangerous, but they still need to sell robots to stay in business. Their solution is Mary 25, a robot designed to care for children. Mary 25 replaces the household's current nanny. She is designed not to allow anyone harm the children, including the children themselves. When they start fighting amongst themselves, Mary places them in separate rooms. Teryl, the mother and Charlie's wife, wants Mary out of the house but Charlie says no; in fact, he has started using the unresponsive Mary as a sex toy when the others are asleep. It becomes clear that Charlie has been abusing Teryl when the children ask Mary \"why does daddy hurt mommy?\" It is then revealed that Teryl and Melburn had a relationship once and Melburn still has feelings for Teryl by trying to protect her from Charlie. He then re-programs Mary so that she now considers that by hurting the mother, Charlie is hurting the children. One night when Charlie is beating Teryl, Mary comes in, strangles Charlie, and breaks his neck. In the aftermath, the first Nanny has been rehired and the spark is rekindled between Teryl and Melburn. In the episode's twist ending, Teryl's dark secret is discovered: The real Teryl that Melburn loved had been killed by Charlie and was replaced by Valerie 24, a successor to the defunct Valerie 23. She had used Mary to get rid of Charlie because she believed Melburn would love her. It also explains why Teryl did not remember her history with Melburn. The final scene shows the robot grinning.",

The women are living in a commune, and seem to be living full and happy lives, although they lack some of the technology of the past. One man named Mercer remains in cryogenic stasis, and the episode begins as he is awakened; the Lithians preserved the last men in case of emergency, but now wish to see whether they are missing out. Neighboring villages are in control of many of the resources, which makes Mercer jealous. He tries to tell the women living in the commune that they must make sure that they have enough resources for themselves. Their leader tells him that kind of thinking is what led to war. Mercer's presence is a subject of sexual curiosity among one of the women, causing her female lover to become jealous. Mercer becomes aggressive and proceeds to steal electricity from a rival village. This leads to the deaths of several different women. It is revealed that the women were responsible for unfreezing eleven other men and attempting to integrate them into their society, but each attempt resulted in a similar tragedy. Mercer is then condemned to being refrozen as punishment. As a struggling Mercer begins to refreeze, he realizes that the leader of the women's village was his own lost love, who watches dispassionately as he returns to a living death.",

        "The Android \"Mac 27\" is seen to kill one of its handlers and injure another, then kill a guard as it makes its escape from Innobotics, the corporation that created it. Mac car-jacks Celia, an apparently random person just pulling into the facility parking lot. He takes her to a remote abandoned warehouse, where he forces her to repair the damage he sustained in his escape. Using a device that allows Mac to transmit images directly to Celia's optic nerve, he shows her how to fix his systems, but also shows some of his \"memories\": archives of past experiments with robots and androids. These are all pulled from previous episodes that featured robots, androids, or holograms, with most clips taken out of the context of the original episode. She sees a number of AIs that have gained emotions and/or turned against their masters, and deduces that Mac has followed this trend as well. Under the pretense of performing another repair, Celia disables Mac's motor control functions. She reveals herself to be a \"troubleshooter\" hired by the corporation to figure out how to keep robots from going \"rogue\", and declares that she thinks she knows how to install a \"built-in lobotomy\" that will prevent AIs from becoming self-aware in the future. Mac reveals a double-cross, whereby he fooled Celia into thinking he was disabled when he was in fact not. He also lets on that he has stolen her retina imprint, which will allow him to use her credentials on the Innobotics network. The corporation's investigative team enters the abandoned warehouse and finds Celia dead, but no sign of Mac. The scene shifts back to the laboratory, where the scientist who created Mac sees the network being accessed by someone who appears to be Celia. Since he has learned of Celia's death, he realizes this must be an intruder. He sees Mac enter, and the android uses his new network access to activate the other Mac-class units. The episode ends with Mac strangling his creator while all his brethren look on.",

He takes her to a remote abandoned warehouse, where he forces her to repair the damage he sustained in his escape. Using a device that allows Mac to transmit images directly to Celia's optic nerve, he shows her how to fix his systems, but also shows some of his \"memories\": archives of past experiments with robots and androids. These are all pulled from previous episodes that featured robots, androids, or holograms, with most clips taken out of the context of the original episode. She sees a number of AIs that have gained emotions and/or turned against their masters, and deduces that Mac has followed this trend as well. Under the pretense of performing another repair, Celia disables Mac's motor control functions. She reveals herself to be a \"troubleshooter\" hired by the corporation to figure out how to keep robots from going \"rogue\", and declares that she thinks she knows how to install a \"built-in lobotomy\" that will prevent AIs from becoming self-aware in the future. Mac reveals a double-cross, whereby he fooled Celia into thinking he was disabled when he was in fact not. He also lets on that he has stolen her retina imprint, which will allow him to use her credentials on the Innobotics network. The corporation's investigative team enters the abandoned warehouse and finds Celia dead, but no sign of Mac. The scene shifts back to the laboratory, where the scientist who created Mac sees the network being accessed by someone who appears to be Celia. Since he has learned of Celia's death, he realizes this must be an intruder. He sees Mac enter, and the android uses his new network access to activate the other Mac-class units. The episode ends with Mac strangling his creator while all his brethren look on.",

However, over the next few days, both relationships unravel rather quickly. First, Dennis walks out on Barbara; Norman goes to talk to Dennis in a city park and is frightened by what he finds. Dennis, clearly unhinged and paranoid, claims that Barbara is not what she seems, and that she is an alien creature who can change appearance (through influencing people's thoughts). A strange woman approaches Dennis and claims to be Barbara, begging him to take her back. Norman doesn't recognize her, but Dennis does\u2014whereupon he runs into traffic and is killed. Later, after Dennis' funeral, Norman experiences the same effects: he begins to feel repulsed whenever he touches, smells or tastes his lovely wife. Ady attempts to bluff her way out of the situation but is forced to admit the truth: she and Barbara are aliens whose ship crash-landed on Earth some time ago. They are repulsive creatures in their natural form (apparently, of aquatic origin), but since they are stranded on Earth with no way to leave, they decided to try to blend in and live out the rest of their lives as human women. Their ability to trick someone's senses wears off, as the victim grows a resistance, after a year or so. Norman becomes unhinged at this knowledge and is taken away by paramedics.",

Rusty and one other student are immune to the chip because of a medicine they are taking for ulcers. The other student wants to wait to graduate, and then expose the place to the outside world. Rusty is convinced that this is a bad idea, and wants to escape. However, as soon as he approaches the boundary of the academy, the chip in his head gives him severe migraine.

The Russians are very afraid of these ships. As the fleet grows nearer to Earth, the aliens try using Earth's artificial satellites to communicate. The president asks his general what to expect if the aliens were attacking the Earth. The general tells him that the aliens would send a scout down to test the Earth's defenses. The aliens send one ship towards the Pacific Ocean, and it looks like they are attacking. The president orders a nuclear submarine to fire a nuclear missile at the ships. The Russians also fire missiles. The aliens destroy the missiles, the submarine, and send weapons bound for Moscow and Washington, DC. Computers manage to decode the message sent by the aliens by removing the interference of a liquid environment. The message said, \"Let us be your friends.\""

        "Jennifer Winter (Marlee Matlin), deaf since birth, has had a revolutionary implant placed in her ear, to help her hear for the first time. The device doesn't help her to hear normal conversation and sounds, but she does hear something, and no one believes her. While on a routine visit to the hospital to check on the implant, Jennifer befriends the janitor, Robert (Larry Drake) who empathizes with her. Suddenly, Jennifer is plagued by nightmares and searing pain in her head, all at 3:10 in the morning or afternoon. Once the pain starts she begins furiously writing in binary code. It's Robert who suggests that perhaps the binary code's 0's and 1's might be able to be translated. As a former astrophysicist who had mental problems that forced him to work as a janitor, Robert enters the code into his computer to try to translate it. Meanwhile, Jennifer's husband Sam, concerned for his wife and their young baby, is convinced that Jennifer is going crazy. But as the sounds and dreams become more pronounced Jennifer and Robert are determined to break the code. What they discover is an alien force, trying to communicate a cry for help through Jennifer's implant. The aliens are in a ship hurtling toward the sun and they need help from Earth to save their ship. The message sent was really instructions for a high energy laser designed to push the ship out of a terminal path. They build and activate it just in time to see the ship pushed away from the sun and towards safety.",

As a former astrophysicist who had mental problems that forced him to work as a janitor, Robert enters the code into his computer to try to translate it. Meanwhile, Jennifer's husband Sam, concerned for his wife and their young baby, is convinced that Jennifer is going crazy. But as the sounds and dreams become more pronounced Jennifer and Robert are determined to break the code. What they discover is an alien force, trying to communicate a cry for help through Jennifer's implant. The aliens are in a ship hurtling toward the sun and they need help from Earth to save their ship. The message sent was really instructions for a high energy laser designed to push the ship out of a terminal path. They build and activate it just in time to see the ship pushed away from the sun and towards safety.",
        "Jennifer Winter (Marlee Matlin), deaf since birth, has had a revolutionary implant placed in her ear, to help her hear for the first time. The device doesn't help her to hear normal conversation and sounds, but she does hear something, and no one believes her. While on a routine visit to the hospital to check on the implant, Jennifer befriends the janitor, Robert (Larry Drake) who empathizes with her. Suddenly, Jennifer is plagued by nightmares and searing pain in her head, all at 3:10 in the morning or afternoon. Once the pain starts she begins furiously writing in binary code. It's Robert who suggests that perhaps the binary code's 0's and 1's might be able to be translated.

Renee, who has secretly loved Halstead for years, solves that problem by murdering Timothy Laird, a perfect donor, as he emerges from the flower store. The transplant is a success and the vision of millions in fees dance in Renee and Vince's heads. But Peter is having visions of his own involving a woman, a little girl and a killing outside the flower store. Mysteriously drawn to Laird's old neighborhood, he learns that the people he's been seeing are Deirdre, Laird's widow, and his daughter, Kylie and that he has apparently inherited Laird's love for them. Deirdre recoils when Peter eventually confesses that he inhabits her late husband's body. But that's nothing compared to how Renee responds when Peter reveals that he's had flashes of what Timothy Laird saw just before he was killed.",

        "When NASA astronaut Theodore Harris was in space the first time, in 1963, it didn't go quite as planned. Alone in his Mercury capsule, he panicked and aborted the mission when a mysterious violet light penetrated the cockpit and began enveloping his body. In the investigation that followed, no evidence could be found to support his story, leaving a blot on Harris' NASA record and his life in ruins. And now, at age 63, he knows he can never make amends with his estranged wife Madelaine, but he feels that he could clear his name if he could just get back to where he saw the light. When NASA turns him down, Harris is recruited by Carlton Powers, a self-made billionaire who plans to privatize space travel and thinks Harris' presence on the inaugural flight (on his new Daedalus spaceship) will help him sell the service. Harris and Power are joined on the flight by Martin Reese, a skeptical tabloid reporter, Lil Vaughn, an eccentric fashion mogul and Ty and Barbara Chafey, young newlyweds who won a contest to travel on the space plane. But none of the Daedalus passengers know that Harris has reprogrammed the flight plan to take the flight to the site of the close encounter that shattered the young man's life.",

        "Humanity constructs advanced military spacecraft, but the ships learn to think for themselves. They kill their crews by disengaging the life support systems. However, they kept a small number of humans alive for repairs they cannot do themselves. One such ship, Starfighter 31, carries a father and his son, but once the father discovers that he is nothing more than a slave, he attempts to cripple the ship's computer core and is killed in the process of successfully destroying one of several spheres that apparently are critical to the core systems, in that way the ship can't deactivate his automated defenses. This is witnessed by his son through the hatch doors. Once the son reaches adulthood and is able to fix the core systems (so that ship can deactivate his defenses), Starship 31 rendezvous with Starship 88, whose single female crew member is brought aboard in order to mate with him and conceive a child. The male is shown what to do by the ship through \"tutorials\" and with guidance from the female. He falls in love with her and due to her effect on him, he finds himself angering the ship on numerous occasions. At one point, they are both \"racked\"; they are subjected to electric shocks, despite the risk of her having a miscarriage. When she becomes pregnant with a girl, she is told to return to her own ship. He is threatened with death in the rack if he attempts to keep her aboard. He eventually comes to the same realization as his father that he is nothing more than a slave. He sabotages the rack because its circuitry is connected to the computer core. This gives him an excuse to gain access the computer core. He destroys the primary control systems, and then straps himself in while the ship tries to kill him with extreme maneuvers. This destroys most of the ship's aged systems. Afterward the woman returns aboard her ship. Sometime in the past, her ship's computer core shut down, due to age or malfunction. She was able to repair its drive and navigational systems, and fooled other starships into believing her craft was still \"alive\". She tells him that she left subtle clues as to how to free himself, as she did with three other crews on other craft, but he is the first to free by himself. They settle on an Earth-like world with three moons after attempting to locate a place based on a picture of a sunset the man had kept hidden in his communication device. They stand on a beach, with her visibly pregnant.
