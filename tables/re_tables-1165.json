Thus the old street rightly serves as an introduction to the Town of Oaks, for on both sides of the street one sees the beautiful, shady and gnarled old oak trees of which the biggest old giants probably date back to 1760. The age of the others dates back to the year 1812. The increase in modern traffic which makes the widening of the streets essential, has threatened the life of these trees, but with the cordial co-operation of the Municipality the trees in Dorp Street, between the railway line and Pastorie Street and those in the Avenue between Pastorie and Van Riebeeck Streets, have been proclaimed historical monuments. However, a new danger\u2014leaf-blight\u2014now threatens these ancient trees. Proclaimed 1950.",

The oldest feature of the house is its four side gables; they are of the holbol type, but show a breaking up of the concaves and convexes into wavy lines reminiscent of a similar tendency in the front gables of the Zevenrivieren-Hazendal type, c, 1790. The house may therefore date from 1783 or soon after. Philip Jacob Haupt purchased the farm in 1819 and it must be accepted that he was responsible for the erection of the present front gable, with almost straight outlines, with the two front doors built in and also for the Georgian windows. Their outer surrounding pilasters are continued upward to form the outer gable pilasters. The Libertas Parva building complex is a fine example of the Stellenbosch architecture in the 18th and 19th centuries and lends a particular character to that part of the village.

Grosvenor House is associated with the oldest and best-known Stellenbosch and, therefore, South African families. The land on which it stands was granted to Christiaan Ludolph Neethling in 1781. He came to the Cape from Germany in 1741 and became the progenitor of this widespread Afrikaans family. The building also provides a clear demonstration of how a simple structure could develop into a worthy example of Cape architecture. The house that Christiaan Neethling built consisted of a row of single-storeyed thatched rooms in Drostdy Street. At the end of the 18th and beginning of the 19th centuries a gable was added above the front door and a room was built on at the back which gave the building the shape of a T. Later additions made it into a full-scale H-shaped house. The sick-comforter, Herold, F added a second storey with a flat roof, an alteration that was at first probably confined to the front part of the house. These changes gave the house a completely new fa\u00e7ade: four fluted pilasters with a richly ornamented cornice; a teak stable-door framed by shorter, ribbed pilasters; teak sash-windows with inner shutters of stinkwood and, right at the top, a little palm tree in bas relief, taken from the crest of the community. This is how the house still stands today. The outbuildings on either side of the main house were probably also built in Herold time. Frederick Neethling who occupied the house just when the late Georgian style was fashionable, was probably responsible for the wagon-wheel fanlight. The house, a cultural treasure in its own right, is a worthy repository for relics of the history of Stellenbosch and its neighbourhood.",

Shortly before Simon van der Stel\u2019s arrival, permission was given to Mostert and Pieter Visagie to cultivate the farm Buffelscop to the east of the Tygerberg. But, Buffelscop was a loan-farm and when Simon van der Stel announced in November 1679 that freehold land was available to all who wished to settle along the banks of the Eerste River, Jan Mostert availed himself of the offer. He chose the beautiful piece of land on the north bank of the Eerste River where the present residential area, Mostertsdrift, is situated. The homestead of Mostertsdrift, situated among shady oak-trees and surrounded by a high wall, is not only part of the early history of the Town of Oaks, but also an elegant example of an old-fashioned, aristocratic group of farm-buildings in the Boland.",

Thaba 'Nchu is not only a typical example of late Victorian houses erected in Stellenbosch at the turn of the century, but is also the only one of its kind which has been restored to its authentic colour scheme, an important feature being the simulated brick pattern of the outside walls. The walls are plastered with a raised narrow moulding applied in the first instance in a brickwork design and then painted black. From a distance the black lines against the ochre coloured plaster gives the impression that the wall is constructed of brick. The rustication is accentuated by white paint. The stoep is covered by a candy-striped curved corrugated-iron verandah, supported on cast-iron pillars which are decorated with delicate flower-and-leaves tracery. The section of the wall above the verandah and below the eaves has been painted white with black etchings, giving it a Tudor look.

        "The case of the clock, made of stinkwood, yellowwood and ebony, is most elegant. The heavy base which rests on carved, moulded feet, is particularly striking. From the base there rises the elegant, slender case. The clock is probably the only surviving one that was made at the Cape during the 18th century. It was made by Johann Michael Junck who arrived at the Cape from Furfeld in Germany in the ship Bleijswijk in 1765. This old grandfather clock is an outstanding example of the fine craftsmanship that was practised at the Cape during the 18th century.",

With her right hand she shelters love. The figure is gilded and set in a floodlit marble lined recess in the external wall of the Clydebank Town Hall. There is also a clock and carillon of bells in the municipal tower. Tablets with the names of those lost in the two World Wars are positioned on either side of the figure. The recess is flanked by pilasters and palm leaves are engraved above it. Gilbert carried out the sculptural work on this memorial. The names of those remembered are inscribed on the left and in the centre the words \"THE/ GLORIOUS/ DEAD/ 1914 1918/ 1939 - 1945/ THIS SHRINE/ WITH THE/ CLOCK AND CHIMES/ DEDICATED TO THE MEMORY OF THE/ MEN OF CLYDEBANK/ WHO LAID DOWN THEIR LIVES IN THE/ GREAT WARS/ NON OMNIS MORIAR\" appear and further names are listed on the figure's right side."

        "The Eccleston Park War Memorial stands in a small garden on the St Helens Road and has work by Gilbert and Weingartner. The memorial comprises a pedestal standing on a plinth and at the top of the pedestal is a bronze statue of a soldier who is raising field glasses to his eyes with his left hand and holds a revolver in his right hand. His foot rests on a German helmet. At the foot of the plinth a bronze statue of a young woman stands with her arms outstretched towards the soldier offering him a branch of laurel. On each side of the pedestal are four relief panels. One depicts a group of marching soldiers, another a group of airmen, anther some soldiers with camels and in the fourth is a naval scene. The main inscription reads \" TO THE GLORIOUS MEMORY/ OF ALL THOSE FROM THE/ WEST DERBY HUNDRED OF/ THE COUNTY PALATINE OF/ LANCASTER WHO FOUGHT/ AND GAVE THEIR LIVES FOR THEIR KING AND COUNTRY IN/ THE GREAT WAR 1914-1918/ THIS MEMORIAL IS ERECTED BY F R DIXON NUTTALL JP INGLEHOLME\" and the words \"THE LAURELS OF THE/ SONS ARE WATERED/ FROM THE HEARTS/ OF THE MOTHERS\" appear on the relief panels. The Bishop of Liverpool carried out the unveiling on the 23rd July 1922. Gilbert and Weingartner carried out the sculptural work and the bronzes were cast by H.H.Martyn of Cheltenham. It appears that the memorial was commissioned by Dr. Frederick Dixon-Nuttall, whose son John had died in the war. The Dixon-Nuttall family had been involved in the Glass making industry for many years and were involved in the establishment of United Glass (UGB) in St Helens.

A winged Angel holding a cross holds a crown over a kneeling soldier and a carved scroll is flanked by two carved roses. The whole sculptured group is positioned under a canopy which rests on a slightly projecting corbel table, the corbels representing the tracks of tanks. The memorial is flanked by a Union Flag and the flag of the 55th Division. Weingartner and Gilbert designed the memorial and the sculptural work was done by W. Meadows. The ashes of Lt Gen Sir Hugh Jeudwine who commanded the division from its formation in 1916 until the end of the war rest at the back of the memorial. The inscription reads \"THEY WIN OR DIE / WHO WEAR THE ROSE OF LANCASTER / FIFTY FIFTH DIVISION\" Photograph to left courtesy Phillip Medhurst."

The house is said to date from 1768; the end-gables and the front gable were added in 1800, during the ownership of Paul Roux. The plan of the house, points to it having grown in stages. The house is H-shaped, but a wall (in which there is an 18c wall-cupboard flanked by doors) separates the voorhuis (which is deeper than the adjoining rooms) from the agterkamer. This is usual in a house that was once T-shaped. There is a flat-roofed addition to the right-hand back wing. The front gable is of a transitional type, with holbol characteristics as well as a small pediment; the end-gables also have pediments, with unusual undulating outlines. There is no back gable, which supports the theory that the front and end-gables are later additions. Most original ceilings and many doors survive, but the external woodwork is 19th century. The thatch had been replaced by corrugated iron with raised eaves level. Flanking the house, and in line with it, are outbuildings with iron roofs and plain holbol end-gables.",

The front of this house is one of the most striking in the Western Cape, an outstanding example of the late neo-classical type of gable. The impressive appearance of the gable is due to the perfect proportions of the elevation as well as the unique design of the gable itself. The gable occupies precisely one-third of the narrow facade, a circumstance which gives it height and prominence. The balance is preserved by a full-width and a half-width window on each side of the door and a full-width dormer window above it. The front stable door and fanlight together with the sash windows, small panes and wooden shutters, all form a harmonious whole. The gable derives its particular character from four pilasters which rise without interruption from the stoep, the vase on each of the pilasters and the triangular pediment. The monotony of the plain plastered spaces between the pilasters is broken by festoons.",
