        "The 93rd annual Kamehameha Schools Song Contest was held on Friday, March 22, 2013. The theme for the 2013 Song Contest was, \u201cHe Lei Poina \u2018Ole Ke Keiki: A Beloved Child is a Lei Never Forgotten.\u201d The words lei (garland) and pua (flower), can poetically refer to children. Although Pauahi did not have keiki of her own, her aloha and concern for her people moved her to create the Kamehameha Schools for the children of the L\u0101hui Hawai\u2018i, her Native Hawaiian people. As we look to the future, as Pauahi did over 125 years ago, we focus on the youth. This year's songs reflect the deep aloha that m\u0101kua and k\u016bpuna\u2014parent and grandparent generations\u2014have for their pua. Just as a child clings to its mother, so too does a beloved lei adorn the wearer. Each of this year\u2019s song contest mele was composed as a loving makana for a child. Some are well known while others are making their debut. Like Pauahi\u2019s never ending aloha for her people, these beautiful mele continue to express the composer\u2019s love, hopes and dreams for a precious child. Please enjoy the 93rd annual Kamehameha Schools Song Contest, featuring the theme He Lei Poina \u2018Ole Ke Keiki \u2013 A beloved child is a lei never forgotten..

        "The 2000 Song Contest was entitled \"Celebrating the Music of Helen Desha Beamer\". The competition showcased songs composed by the prolific composer, Helen Desha Beamer. She was a teacher of the mele and hula of Hawai\u2018i and shared her knowledge of things Hawaiian with family and friends. Her legacy lives on, not only in her family and their many talents, but also in her music and the era it represents. Her legacy also lives in the students of Kamehameha who have performed her music often over the past 78 years of Song Contests and perform it again in this year's program that is devoted exclusively to her.

        "Football season is coming up and Eric has been training hard to become the starting wide receiver. Coach Wagner stresses to the team to the importance of keeping their grades up. Eric is proud and happy when the coach tells him he's starting against Central High. But when Coach Wagner finds out Eric is taking a physics course he tells him to play it safe and drop that class. Eric is ready to quit the class when he has a conversation with his teammate Perkins who tells him the coach hasn't said a thing to him about dropping physics. Eric feels that the coach assumes that because he's black, he will have more trouble with a tough academic course than a white player would. He later tells Coach Wagner that he thinks his attitude toward black players is unfair, and he complains to his friends Ryan and Nicky too. During the game against Central, Coach Wagner talks to Eric about respect, but Eric doesn't respond and he sits out the rest of the game. The next day Eric goes to see Screech about re-enrolling for physics and learns about standing up to an adult. Later he apologizes to Coach Wagner for his actions and tells him about all the things he did to make a better grade. The coach promises to make things up to him. Also, Katie and Maria try to turn Liz into something she's not, a mall shopper and an advice-giver. Screech demands his own office from Mr. Belding."

Maria meets the producer Shannon Stewart, who wants her to change her format to an exploitation-type show where she finds out secrets from the rest of the gang to air on the next episode. Screech is concerned about the direction Maria's show is going in. The next day, Ryan and Liz are being interviewed on the show when secrets about their dating get revealed, causing Nicky to get in on the action. Shannon and her boss love the new show and think Maria is terrific. But the gang are all mad at her for airing their private business, and when Mr. Belding find out what Maria has been doing, he cancels the show. At \"Cool TV,\" vice-president Brian Blair tells Maria about the plans they have for her and signs her to do a weekly show on their channel. Shannon and Brian suggested that Maria should do her first promo at the Max. When she tells the audience about what she did, Maria rejects the offer from \"Cool TV\" and apologizes to everyone. Liz still has no idea who she has to choose to date, Nicky or Ryan. Also, Nicky has a plan to get tickets to see the Smashing Pumpkins concert and enlists a fan named Bongo to help him."

        "The 92nd annual Kamehameha Schools Song Contest was held on Friday, March 16, 2012. The theme for the 2012 Song Contest was, \u201cHo\u2018\u014dla L\u0101hui, Ho\u2018oulu Pae \u2018\u0100ina \u2013 Vibrant People, Thriving Lands,\u201d reflecting Pauahi\u2019s enduring legacy. Much has happened in a hundred and twenty-five years since the founding of Kamehameha Schools. Today, some 6,000 young Hawaiians attend programs at three campuses located on different islands, with some 45,000 Hawaiian learners receiving educational services throughout the community. Supporting this tremendous educational legacy is a significant land legacy consisting of over 345,000 acres. The inter-relationship of people and land \u2014 of k\u0101naka and \u2018\u0101ina \u2014 is fundamental to Hawaiian identity and central in Hawaiians\u2019 worldview. For the 2012 competition, some of Hawai\u2018i\u2019s most accomplished musicians and composers created musical ho\u2018okupu to celebrate Pauahi\u2019s lands and the vibrant communities that call them home. The sophomore women of 2014 opened the competition with their song, I Keauhou Ka \u02bb\u014cnohi A Ka L\u0101hui by Keawe and Tracie Lopes and arranged by Zachary Lum, a mele honoring the sacred sites of Keauhou-Kona, Hawai\u02bbi. The junior women of 2013 followed with Ka Leo O Wai\u0101lua, written by Nalani Choy and Randie Kamuela Fong and arranged by Aaron J. Sal\u0101, which describes the incomparable beauty of Wai\u0101lua on O'ahu's North Shore. The senior women of 2012 ended the women's competition with their winning song written by Keola Donaghy and arranged by Kenneth Makuak\u0101ne, Aloha Keauhou, a song inspired by the diversity of the K\u012blauea rain forest of Ka\u02bb\u016b. Their performance won them the New England Mother's Cup and tied with the junior class of 2013 for the Richard Lyman, Jr. Trophy for best use of Hawaiian language. The junior men of 2013 began the men's competition and took the prize with their song by Dennis Kamakahi, Kamal\u014d, the center of Moloka\u02bbi, and provider of many resources for the people of the island, with an arrangement by Aaron D. Mahi. They won the George Alanson Andrus Cup for best men's performance of the night. The senior men of 2012 sang next with their song, Waip\u0101, written Carlos Andrade and arranged by Robert Cazimero, which speaks of this sacred land that helps us to thrive, and our duty to protect it. The sophomore men of 2014 rounded up the men's competition with their rendition of Les Ceballos' arrangement of \u02bbO Wai\u02bbanae Ku\u02bbu Home Aloha by Ku\u02bbualohanui Kauli\u02bba and Ke\u02bbala Kwan, which tells of Wai\u02bbanae lands that give birth to resilient and proud Hawaiians, from Ka\u02bbala to M\u0101kaha. The coed competition began with the senior class of 2012 singing, Kaka\u02bbako Ku\u02bbu \u02bb\u0100ina Aloha, written by Kaiponohea Hale and arranged by Les Ceballos, telling of the efforts to bring back a Hawaiian sense of place in Honolulu's Kaka\u02bbako district. This performance earned them the Helen Desha Beamer Award for best musical performance of the night. The freshman class of 2015 followed with their song by Manu Boyd and arranged by Zachary Lum, Nani He\u02bbeia, a spirited mele which speaks of the \u02bb\u0101ina momona of He\u02bbeia, where the pala\u02bba ferns thrive, and fish are abundant. The freshman director Dezarae Le\u02bbi went on to win the Louise A\u02bboe McGregor Award for best director. The sophomore class of 2014 went third with an arrangement by Les Ceballos, performing Nani Punalu\u02bbu by Kamak\u0101ne Hopkins, a song that describes the lush land and thriving lo\u02bbi at Punalu\u02bbu, in Ko\u02bbolauloa. The junior class ended the 2013 competition with their co-ed prize winning song, He Aloha Ka\u02bb\u016bp\u016blehu, written by L\u012bhau and Kellen Paik and arranged by Aaron J. Sal\u0101, which speaks of Hual\u0101lai, where Puna winds caress the body. They captured not only the Charles E. King Cup for best coed performance but also a tie with the senior women of 2012 for the Richard Lyman, Jr. Trophy for best use of Hawaiian language. Results"

Heptadd reveals that he, Vitog, and Tangath Toborn come from a ghostly place called the Spirit Lands and that they can only stay in other places as long as they have something called a \"Talazar,\" such as Heptadd's Crown or Tangath's Sword of Khy'at. Heptaad tells Maxxor on how Tangath Toborn fought Vitog before and destroyed Vitog's Staff of Arcad causing the creature to retreat. Tangath Toborn is still frozen in the glacial wave formed in the battle with the M'arillians, and destroying his sword is the only way to release him. At Runic Grove, Tangath's spirit uses the grove's power to defeat Vitog, after which he returns to the Spirit Lands. At the end of the episode, the tribes and the Chaotic players come together to hold a funeral/monument for Tangath at Glacier Plains.",

Not wanting to be around when the CodeMasters are done with their meeting, he leaves Chaotic and goes to Kiru City in Perim with it being the last place the CodeMasters will look for him.

        "The 2005 competition, entitled \"Songs of the Early 20th Century,\" was held on March 18, 2005 and featured songs that may be considered the \u201ctop ten hits\u201d of seventy-five to a hundred years ago. These beloved mele, sung in the stylistic features of the time period, provide us a window into the past. This song contest featured the music that our great-grandparents enjoyed in their youth in the 85th Annual Kamehameha Schools Song Contest. The senior men of 2005 poured their hearts into Aia Hiki Mai by HRH Princess Likelike and arranged by Aaron J. Sal\u0101, a song about the fond memories recalled about the life of Emma Kapena and her days growing up in L\u012bhau, Lahaina. They won the George Alanson Andrus Cup for best men\u02bbs performance. The junior men of 2006 performed Ninipo, recounting Pele's jealousy of the relationship between Hi\u02bbiaka and H\u014dpoe with an arrangement by Timothy K. Ho. The sophomore men of 2007 in their first the men's competition sang Koni Au I Ka Wai and Ka Ipo Laua\u2018e, arranged by Les Ceballos which spoke about the thrills of falling in love. The senior women of 2005 sang their final performance in the women's competition with Ku\u2018u Ipo Pua Rose arranged by Les Ceballos, which spoke of a love so strong that it was compared to the beloved lei. They won the New England Mother's Cup for best women's performance. The junior women of 2006 performed Pua O Ka M\u0101k\u0101hala arranged by Aaron J. Sal\u0101, describing the love between Katie Stevens \u2018\u012a\u2018\u012b and her husband. The sophomore women of 2007 made their debut in the women's competition with Kukuna O Ka L\u0101, which spoke of a women's journey from Hawai\u2018i around the world, with an arrangement by Randie Kamuala Fong. The freshman class of 2008 debut in the co-ed competition with Kap\u0101pala arranged by Randie Kamuele Fong, which tells a couple and their romantic adventures in Kap\u0101pala. The sophomore class of 2007 sang their rendition of Pua H\u0113\u2018\u012b arranged by Timothy K. Ho, which spoke of a sweetheart that was compared to the beauty of Kap\u0101lama on O\u2018ahu. Their rendition won them three awards: the Richard Lyman Jr. Award for best use of Hawaiian language; the Helen Desha Beamer Award for best musical performance and the Charles E. King Cup for best coed performance. The junior class of 2006 sang Manu \u2018\u014c\u2018\u014d arranged by Les Ceballos, that spoke of a relationship between a Kohala boy and a Hilo girl.

It's obvious, though, that Dimmick prefers guys who can talk sports with him and he thinks that female employees are second-rate. Nicky is soon made assistant manager even though Rachel is a super employee who has worked hard all summer. Ryan agrees with Rachel that Dimmick is unfair, but when he talks to Nicky about it, Nicky doesn't seem to care. While Nicky is in charge the projector breaks and he has a theatre full of unhappy customers on his hands. Rachel saves the day, though, by smoothly handling the situation. When Mr. Dimmick gives Nicky all the credit, he agrees that Dimmick discriminates against females. With the aid of Katie, Ryan and Nicky find a way to prove to the visiting vice-president of the theatre chain that Dimmick has been unfair to Rachel. Dimmick is suspended and Rachel is rehired on the spot. Elsewhere in the mall, Mr. Belding and Screech are running Yukon Yogurt, but their product isn't very good. Screech and new employee Eric doctor up the taste of the low-fat yogurt with some high-fat hot fudge. The yogurt becomes a best-seller, but Belding doesn't know the secret. Also, Katie is an apprentice for well-known hairdresser Jean-Paul. Maria begs her friend to get her an appointment with him. Katie does, but Maria's new hairdo is a big disappointment.

At the \"coffeehouse\" night at the Max, all three couples get in big fights and all the yelling and crying babies ruin Maria's song and they drive away the audience.

When she gets to the prom, it turns out that Rachel and Maria love her remodeled dress but hate their own new expensive ones. Screech and Ryan hide Mr. Wilson from Eric, and he and his brothers perform. But Wilson doesn't hear their performance\u2014he's helping fix Belding's air conditioner! Katie and Nicky share a dance and a kiss."

The kids decide to help Ernie out by being his staff for the rest of their vacation and the lodge stays open. Ryan suggests Lindsay help out in the kitchen, where Greg works. Working closely together, Greg tells Lindsay he's attracted to her; she confesses she feels likewise. They kiss but Lindsay feels guilty. Later, Ryan gives her his gift. The new guests are ready to desert Sleepy Mountain when they hear the competing lodge has a snow machine, but by using fake snow on the windows and barricading the front door, Ryan and the guys fool the guests into thinking they're snowed in, at least until the real snowstorm comes in a couple of days. Lindsay tells the other girls about her dilemma and that she might choose Greg. The guests find out about the snow scam, but the kids plead with them to stay, saying they were doing it all for Ernie. The guests have been so entertained by the kids that they agree to stay and wait for the real snow. A troubled Lindsay tells Ryan about Greg and gives him back his charm. Ryan is hurt and angry."

        "Tom, Sarah, Kaz, and Peyton discover that many Chaotic players have made their way into the past. They pass the blame onto each other for letting the secret of Dranikus Threshold out. After repelling an attack from the UnderWorlders, Najarin angrily told Tom and his friends to leave. Once they did, Najarin went from angry to depressed. Back in the present, Tom visits Najarin stating that he never should've learned the secrets of Dranikus Threshold. Najarin states that he shouldn't have snapped at Tom. Najarin then speaks of his assistant, Afjak in ancient Perim who used the portal of Dranikus Threshold and was never seen again after he overheard Tom and Najarin talking. Klay and Krystella, who feel going into the past is too troublesome, head into M'arrillian territory where they find Lord Van Bloot shoveling coal into the ovens after he fled from the UnderWorld. They inform Lord Van Bloot about the secrets of Dranikus Threshold. Their price is that no other Chaotic players are allowed into the past and they themselves must be accompanied by bodyguards when they go on scan quests. With that knowledge, Lord Van Bloot plans to use Dranikus Threshold to go back in time and conquer all of Perim. Najarin and creatures from the other tribes come to prevent this from happening, with Najarin ultimately using the mugic Location Lament to destroy Dranikas Threshold. One of the final scenes shows Tom and his friends overhearing a chaotic player inform others that a mysterious island has appeared, hovering, over Perim. It is also revealed that Afjak is Najarin's son.",

Sobtjek and the other Mipedians learn from the Mipedian conjurer Skerrel the Wise that the M'arrillians have flooded Ropa'Sahhk and taken over the Mipedians there. Scara advises that they need to join forces with the Warriors of Owayki. Sobtjek decides to take some M'arrillians to where they are said to be found. Meanwhile, Peyton, Tom, and Kaz are looking for Sarah when they run into the Acolytes of Dakkamal who take them to their camp where Ario and Sobtjek are. Upon learning from Peyton what had happened to Sarah, Sobtjek decides to bring them along in the direction where the Mipedian ghost went. They soon run into a storm which sucks in two Mipedian soldiers. Sobtjek decides that they will camp out in the nearby ruins. The next morning, the group encounters the Mipedian ghost who Sobtjek identifies as Owayki. The spirit of Owayki then attacks the approaching Ihun'kalin (the M'arrillian responsible for flooding Ropa'Sahhk). When Ihun'kalin is unable to control Owayki, he ends up controlling Dakamall and some of the Mipedian soldiers while he continues to fight Owayki. Sobtjek uses the Melody of Mirage to fool the brainwashed Mipedians. Upon reachng a mist-covered area, the group proceeds with caution. When they cross the mist, they find Sarah with the petrified Warriors of Owayki. When Dakkamol and the brainwashed Mipedians close in, Peyton has Sobtjek place a mugic in the shape of it within one of the petrified warriors bringing them to life. Peyton learns that the Mugic is running out. With help from Owayki, Tom, Kaz, Peyton, and Sarah recharge the Warriors with the Mugics. Ihun'kalin manages to withdraw the brainwashed Mipedians and retreats. Sobtjek tells Owayki that the real battle is beginning.",

        "The 2006 Song Contest was entitled \"Celebrating the Music of Lena Machado.\" Known as the Songbird of Hawai\u2018i, Lena Machado was one of the legendary singers of Hawaiian music. The music of Lena Machado has touched the hearts of people for generations. Her unforgettable melodies range from simple two-line ditties to fully developed ballads. Her poetic expressions, whether playful or poignant, seem like intimate conversations. And who can forget her lilting soprano voice which still resonates in the memory of Hawai\u2018i\u2019s people. The senior women of the class of 2006 won the New England Mothers' Cup for best women's performance with Kamalani O Keaukaha, arranged by Robert Uluwehi Cazimero. The junior women of the class of 2007 performed P\u014dhai Ke Aloha, arranged by Les Ceballos, and the sophomore women of the class of 2008 performed Ho\u2018onanea, arranged by Leila Kiaha and Les Ceballos. The senior men of 2006 won the George Alanson Andrus Cup for best men's performance with Holo Wa\u2018ap\u0101, arranged by Aaron J. Sal\u0101. The junior men of 2007 presented Hawai\u2018i \u0112 \u2018O\u2018oe N\u014d E Ka \u2018Oi, arranged by Les Ceballos, and the sophomore men of 2008 performed Mai Lohilohi Mai \u2018Oe, arranged by Leila Kiaha and Les Ceballos. With their rendition of Ku\u2018u W\u0101 Li\u2018ili\u2018i, arranged by Leila Kiaha and Les Ceballos, the freshmen class of 2009 won two awards: the Helen Desha Beamer Award for best musical performance, the Charles E. King Cup for best co-ed performance. They also tied with the sophomore class of 2008 for the Richard Lyman, Jr. Trophy for best use of the Hawaiian language. The sophomore class of 2008 performed Ho\u2018oipo Hula (Ipo Hula), arranged by Robert Uluwehi Cazimero. The junior class of 2007 performed Aloha N\u014d, arranged by Aaron J.

While Tangath Toborn leads a group to Glacier Plains to attack the M'arrillian bases while M'arrillian Coral Fighters led by Phelphor surround Kiru City at the same time, Maxxor plans to go the M'arrillian city of M'arr to capture Aa'une and bring him to Lake Blakeer (a location that disrupts mind-control abilities) to negotiate a peace treaty. Tom, Sarah, and Peyton encounter Najarin who states that there is a traitor amongst the allied ranks. The battle between the M'arrillians rages on. Tangath Toborn struggles to find the Symphony of Stasis Mugic before the heat cannon to melt Glacier Plains activates. Arias and Malvadine's group fights against Phelphor and his Coral Fighters. Najarin suspects that Tartarek is the traitor and has Tom, Peyton, and Sarah investigate. Maxxor is rescued by Chaor and helps Maxxor get to Aa'une. When the Heat Cannon fires at one of the Glaciers, Tangath Toborn manages to use Symphony of Stasis to stop the flood, but it takes effect after he's engulfed in the water seemingly sacrificing his life in the process. As part of evidence to find out if Tartarek is a traitor, Kaz battles Tartawrecker. Maxxor and Chaor confront Aa'une. Kaz finds evidence that Tartarek has been taken over by the M'arrillians. Maxxor succeeds in bringing Aa'une to Lake Blakeer. Najarin reveals to the Tribal Council that Tartarek is with the M'arrillians and Tartarek reveals that Aa'une gets stronger at Lake Blakeer as Aa'une assumes his second form.",

When he runs into the slimy disease, Tom is saved by Smidon and manages to obtain a sample. Back at Lake Morn, Garv studies the sample and manages to find a way to develop a serum which is placed in a crystal-cased spear.

Upon stumbling on the Mipedians, they managed to evade them and find the OverWorld camp. They then end up caught by Arias and Attacat and are brought in for questioning. Lucky for them, Najarin intervenes before Viqtarr gains information from them his way. Tangath Toborn returns to reveal that Prince Mudeenu is plotting to take Broken Edge. Hune Marquard creates the Surge Song Mugic which Najarin wasn't able to make. Tangath Torborn decides to use Hun Marquard's Mugic on him, Arias, Viqtarr, Attacat, and the OverWorld soldiers. The Mipedians attack as the OverWorlders fight them. With the Mugic a success, Najarin leaves. Moments later in his drome match, Tom uses his the Surge Song to defeat some of his opponent's creatures. But when it comes to the final creature, Tom as Gaspedan loses its speed and power as some side effect. Tom forfeits his match and heads to Najarin while Kaz and Peyton head to Broken Edge. Tom informs Najarin about Surge Song as the OverWorlders are losing to the Mipedians. Najarin tries to find a way to fix this problem while the OverWorlders try to hold off the Mipedians. Najarin manages to create Revocation and tells Tom to get to Tangath Toborn and give him the Mugic. Tom tricks the Mipedian soldier to thinking that Revocation Mugic drains the energy of the OverWorlders where it actually restores the OverWorlders' energies. This causes the Mipedians to retreat.",
