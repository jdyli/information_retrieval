The group of interns is beginning to study for their residency exams, and April anxiously waits to hear about the results of her board exams, which she finally passes. Cristina and Alex pair up to do a heart valve repair, but resolve that the patient needs to be put on a transplant list. Meanwhile, Cristina encourages Alex to have sex with Jo. In her own failing relationship, she tells Owen that it\u2019s time to start seeing other people, to which he replies, \u201cI\u2019ll try.\u201d Owen and Avery butt heads over hospital finance issues: Owen wants money to fix the hospital and Avery wants money for surgeries. Webber needs a feeding tube to survive, but Bailey has an alternative, less effective, plan that will save Webber\u2019s dignity but not his life. Shane takes charge and puts one in, despite Bailey\u2019s stance. Webber tells Meredith that he picked the wrong person to be in charge of his health decisions, meaning he expected her to just let him die and not bring him back to life."

        "To raise money to repair the damage done to Grey + Sloan Memorial Hospital, the doctors are dressed to the nines and throwing a fundraiser gala. Interns Shane and Stephanie are left to tend the pit by themselves, which forces them to become surgery sharks. All is going well at the gala, until an entertainer falls on top of the gala organizer, resulting in serious injuries. The doctors of Grey + Sloan Memorial Hospital jump right in and become doctors once again. Meanwhile, April and Arizona stay in the supply closet trading relationship stories and drinking champagne. Alex leaves Jo at the gala, after seeing a junkie\u2014whom he thinks is his dad\u2014ushered into the ER. He decides to do a paternity test to find out, and in the middle of his telling Jo that he doesn\u2019t want to know if the junkie is his dad or not, Jo blurts it out that he is.

Her solution is to make them roommates in hopes of them changing each other\u2019s mind.
