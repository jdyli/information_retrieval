Shiki offers a deal with the ESP; the ESP will stop his corruption and let the students live peacefully, and in return, Shiki will fix the barrior protecting the school. The ESP at first rejects this, but agrees on the condition that Mikan will be under his control. Mikan agrees, in order to protect her friends. After her mother's funeral, Mikan is put into the Labyrinth Mansion and separated from her friends (except for Bear, Shiki, and the HSP). Although she accepts her situation, she is saddened. Her friends decide to send her Christmas presents to cheer her up."

        "Detectives Goren and Eames investigate the brutal murder of a teenage girl in The Hamptons, found dead in her car in Queens after a night of partying. The detectives probe the uneasy family relationships concerning the murdered teen's stepfather, a local police officer who has had to deal with his rebellious daughter, all the while trying to protect his youngest child and his dying wife. Nevertheless, the discovery of cell phone records soon deflects the team's investigation in another direction, leading them to investigate the victim's married boss, a supermodel's husband, who had maintained an extramarital affair for a long time with the victim. But when yet another supposed lover comes forward, their attention turns to a different source, while resistance from the local police complicates the investigation. Eventually it is revealed that the victim's stepfather, a cop, murdered her because of the stress the victim's wild antics was causing her dying mother, who has cancer. Ultimately, her killer decides to kill Goren and then himself, knowing that if he kills himself before he's charged, his wife will get his pension. Goren manages to disarm him, but as he's taken into custody, he grabs an officer's gun and kills himself in front of the police and his horrified family.",

The ensuing investigation and questioning launches them into a brawl with the fire department, leading to a hearing before the Commissioner for Logan and Wheeler. The storyline arcs back to the fight as Logan and Wheeler retell their story to the Commissioner, giving perspective to the fight and underlying issues between the NYPD and the FDNY. The brawl proves to be a red herring and it appears the crime was perpetrated by a possible repeat killer when an identical murder twelve years prior comes to light.

At first, the detectives believe that the victim might have been murdered for reasons connected to his career, but soon they begin to suspect it was due to a romantic liaison. As the investigation continues, business partners, disgruntled clients and close friends are all suspects with different motives.

The investigation leads Goren and Eames to question an ex-boyfriend and jealous colleagues of the dead woman, who was set to be the youngest astronaut ever to go up in space. As they probe further and deeper into the case, the investigators find a link to a suspicious married space shuttle commander with whom the victim was having an affair, and a female crew member, who is a close friend of the commander's wife. Close to the end, an unexpected twist changes everything. It turns out that the commander's wife caused Sandy, a jealous colleague, to believe that the commander loved her by sending her emails and gifts. She herself gave Sandy lotion for her dry skin which turned out to have steroids in it. When Sandy couldn't take the fact that the commander was sleeping with the woman, she took matters into her own hands and murdered her.",
        "Detectives Goren and Eames investigate the death of a female astronaut who is found murdered in her hotel room on the morning of a press conference to promote an upcoming shuttle launch. The investigation leads Goren and Eames to question an ex-boyfriend and jealous colleagues of the dead woman, who was set to be the youngest astronaut ever to go up in space. As they probe further and deeper into the case, the investigators find a link to a suspicious married space shuttle commander with whom the victim was having an affair, and a female crew member, who is a close friend of the commander's wife. Close to the end, an unexpected twist changes everything. It turns out that the commander's wife caused Sandy, a jealous colleague, to believe that the commander loved her by sending her emails and gifts. She herself gave Sandy lotion for her dry skin which turned out to have steroids in it.

        "Detectives Goren and Eames investigate the murder of a dentist which turns out to be connected to the death of one of his young patients. As Goren and Eames look into both murders, they follow a trail of counterfeit mouthwash from the streets of Harlem to the FDA and Wall Street ambit. Though initial suspicions by dentist's wife are levied against the local population, the victim was loved and embraced by the Harlem community. The detectives turn their attention to a man, whose close proximity to the clinic makes him an obvious choice for a good eye witness. The man tells them that he saw a woman, then two teen boys leaving the clinic the night of the murder. When suspicious activity turns up on dentist's credit card, Goren and Eames zero in on the two teen boys. Then, the detectives bust the kids for stealing the credit card, but one of the boy's mother gives them an unexpected motive for the dentist's murder: the good doctor was a suspected pedophile.",
