Ichigo then unleashes the Final Getsuga Tensho. Through a flashback it is revealed that while in his inner world, Ichigo could not defeat Tensa Zangetsu, until he allowed his zanpakuto to pierce him, thereby accepting him, and the consequences of the technique, which would strip Ichigo of his Soul Reaper powers. Unleashing the Final Getsuga Tensho allows Ichigo to actually become Getsuga itself, and he unleashes a torrent of darkness that enshrouds the land and overwhelms Aizen. However, Aizen prepares to finish off a weakened Ichigo thanks to the Hogyoku. Aizen is stopped by a kido by Kisuke Urahara, who steps onto the scene, that he planted it inside of the kido he shot just before Aizen transformed the first time. Now that his power has been weakened by Ichigo the seal has begun to work and the Hogyoku no longer sees him as its master resulting in his sealing."

Omaeda is about to go back to sleep when he realises that his little afternoon nap had turned into a 3 hour sleep. Omaeda realises that he is already late and begins to run back to the Sereitei so he does not get punished by Soi Fon. However, he falls off a cliff as he does so and apparently saves the life of a Rukongai boy by falling on top of a hollow who was about to attack the boy, who takes him back to his village where Omaeda claims he is the captain of the 2nd Division. The villagers serve Omaeda platefuls of their best food to express their gratitude to the 'captain' for saving the boy, Ryuzaburo. That night Omaeda who is sleeping in the Rukongai village wakes up and rushes back to 2nd Division's barracks after realising that he will be severely punished by his captain. The next day, Omaeda is shown apologizing and trying desperately to get mercy from his captain, but SoiFon states that Omaeda's presence was not missed and sends him to clean the Seretei grounds by himself. Meanwhile Ryuzaburo and 2 of his friends are trying to get into Seretei to see their 'captain'. Yoruichi and Ichigo happen to be passing by and Yoruichi tells Jidanbo to let the boys in and that she will take responsibility for it.

        "Yachiru encounters an old friend she calls Mappy, and a new face, Mayu. Mappy, or Masayoshi starts to tell the two about how a hollow killed his wife. Mayu, having had her parents killed by a hollow starts to feel a bit close to Masayoshi. Later, after a talk with Kenpachi, Yachiru warns her not to get too close to Mappy. However, this was immediately after asking to travel with him. Later on, Masayoshi protects Mayu, and asks her to accompany him as she had previously asked. Then, Yachiru jumps between the two, and reveals that Kenpachi told her how a hollow possessed Masayoshi, as proven when his love for sweets and the memory of his wife's name were now gone.

They both go to Haru's house and meet the spirit of a child named Yosuke. However, Hitsugaya hesitates from sending Yosuke to Soul Society after hearing that he and his parents died in an accident on the way to a skiing trip, and that he does not wish to leave till he sees snow for the first time. Afterwards, Toshiro stays at Karin's house, where he is mistaken to be her boyfriend by many people. Later it is revealed that Haru had been controlling Yosuke's transformation into a hollow with her own reiatsu, and when she weakened, he went out of control.

The Eds then attempt to get their spot by keeping a look out to see when Kevin leaves. They finally end up in Jonny's spot, on top of a parched bluff, burned to a crisp by the sun. High Heeled Ed: The Eds plan to get big money with their \"Sewer Swamp Ride\", but Sarah, Jimmy, and Nazz are not impressed. When Eddy discovers this, he thinks Kevin, Rolf, and Jonny will come for the sewer ride. Sarah tells Eddy that they went go-karting and will not be back until dinner. The \"Snuggle-Me-Ed\" scam also fails to impress, so the Eds then get some gold paint and make \"jewelry\" to wow the more \"sensitive\" members of the cul-de-sac."
