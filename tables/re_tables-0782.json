In their search for costumes, the kids come across an armoire full of great costumes they can use for the party. Just after the party starts, a terrible storm breaks out and the lights go out. The guests cry out and when the lights come back on, everyone has vanished except for the four kids. Believing their friends to be in danger, the kids set off looking for them.

Elliot wishes he could have known Master as a boy, whereupon Master gives him an undeveloped picture of himself, the only one ever taken.

As the picture develops we see that the figure is missing from the image.

Suddenly a new student, Augustus, appears out of nowhere, and ends up on Elliot's team. Elliot's team is losing miserably, and Augustus is constantly getting them into trouble, particularly with Master, who dislikes the boy intensely right from the start. Soon Elliot's team realizes that they cannot win- no creature is rare enough for them to be able to catch up& except the Screaming Meemie. Going for broke they try to find a way to get the Meemies to come out so they can take a picture. Nothing works until Augustus discovers it by mistake. They rush off with the picture and win the competition, but Augustus fades away before their very eyes. Seeing the picture hanging in the dark room, we see the figure has returned- it was Augustus.

        "A rare natural event is about to take place at Creepschool- a blue moon is rising, which can have unforeseen consequences. Remembering the chaos this caused the last time, Gilbert pressures Malcolm to issue a warning to the school. Despite being convinced that the children are too old for it to be a problem, Malcolm nonetheless tells them they should stow away any dolls they might have as they could get out of hand. The problem is, the kids are too old- so they are too ashamed to admit to the others that they still have their dolls. With the waxing of the moon, the dolls come alive and capture the children to exact their revenge for being so cruelly shunned and neglected. They then force the kids to have a tea party and humiliate the them by exchange embarrassing anecdotes from their past when their dolls were their best friends. Gilbert, so caught up in the possibility that the children might have dolls, completely forgets that he too has a doll of sorts- a statue of a Chinese dragon that stands on his desk. By the time he remembers, it is already on a rampage, incinerating anything and everything that takes Gilbert away from him. Gilbert immediately realizes that the children are in danger, as they are the ones that take most of his time, and tracks them down just as the dragon is about to set them on fire. In the nick of time the blue moon wanes and the dolls and the dragon are back to normal.",

But then he finds a stopwatch, a watch that stops time. Whenever he presses the button everything around him is frozen in time. Josh finds this very useful. He can wake up late for class, stop time, have his breakfast, walk calmly into class and take a seat before unfreezing time again. Nobody around understands what is going on. But Josh's playing with time is taking a toll on his age. Every time he uses the watch he gets older, while everyone else stays the same. Until one day he is an old man, unrecognizable to everyone around him, his friends have to rewind the clock to get him back to his proper age, and think again before they reprimand him for being late.",

When Dorothy has a garage sale outside her room, Victoria gets her hands on a very beautiful mirror. The mirror turns out to be a talking mirror and also the best friend Victoria ever had. She massages Victoria's ego and when Victoria does anything wrong, such as eating Josh's cookies or ruining Elsa's painting, the mirror assuages whatever guilt Victoria may have. The problem is that Victoria's looks are deteriorating more and more. Soon she cannot be without the makeup the mirror offers her. The more selfishly and nastily she behaves under the power of her new ego, the more blemishes she gets. Soon there is only one thing left to do. Take the Creepschool crest that supposedly gives Creepschool all the power and glory it possesses. As soon as Victoria removes the crest from its place, the school starts to crumble and fall to pieces. Victoria finally wakes up from her obsession and despite protests from the mirrors she put the crest back and runs off into the woods convinced she will now be ugly forever. Elsa runs after her and makes her look in a small mirror. When Victoria looks in the mirror, she looks like she always has. Victoria throws the talking mirror down the garbage chute and promises herself she will never look in a mirror again, well not for a very long time at least.",

        "Josh has got a new hand-held computer game and is playing it constantly, so much so that Elliot hasn't gotten any sleep. When Elliot complain, Josh teases him saying he's just jealous cause he could never beat Josh's high score. Faced with this challenge, Elliot starts to play. The object of the game is to escape the ants- each level has a special weapon and golden key that have to be found in order to make it to the next level. Elliot quickly becomes so obsessed with the game that he can think of nothing else, he plays in class, ignores his friends, forgets his school work- clearly something drastic needs to be done. In a final effort to get rid of the game, Mr. Edgar throws it down the inter-dimensional garbage chute, but a desperate Elliot jumps in after it. When he exits the chute he cannot find the game, but soon discovers that he is in fact inside it and has to run for his life from the pixilated ants. Using what he learned playing the game he barely escapes the ants. At first he rushes around in a panic trying to warn everyone about the ants, but they just look at him like he's crazy. It turns out that the ants only appear when he is alone. When he realizes this he does all he can to hang out with his friends, or anyone else who will put up with him. In the end, however, he is forced to defeat the queen ant in the final level in order to escape from the game. When he finally does, the hand-held game reappears and Elliot emerges elated and victorious holding the game- all his friends cannot understand how he could have gotten so carries away with a stupid little game.",

        "Victoria has lost a necklace she got as a present from her parents a few days earlier, and goads everyone into helping her find it. While they're out looking, Janice finds an old toy, a merry-go-round. Whenever she sets it in motion, a strange music starts up and she is transported into the past where she meets a young boy who's just lost his parents and is being taken away to live with his cruel uncle. Each visit to the past, however, last only a few minutes before she is pulled back into her own time again. Despite her friends advice that she stay away from that toy as it could be of evil design, she becomes so concerned with the little boy's fate that she repeatedly returns to the past in an effort to help him, but with each trip the toy becomes damages, and it becomes more and more difficult to return to the past. Meanwhile, her friends, in their search for the necklace, discover the Lost and Found Emporium, a storage room for all things ever lost by anyone throughout time. At first they're not allowed to look for the necklace because whatever lesson Victoria gained by losing the necklace would itself be lost if she were to find the necklace. Finally, however, the caretaker looks in his books and explains that the necklace isn't there anyway because someone else found it. Unbeknownst to them, that someone is Janice, who accidentally finds the necklace when she takes the toy to Tony to ask his help in fixing it. When she then goes back in time one final time, she succeeds in helping the little boy escape and puts him in the care of the benevolent Mr. Mars, who is starting a school for lost children. Having nothing else to give the little boy to remember her by, she gives him Victoria's necklace. Back in the present, Janice is melancholic at the thought that she'll never see the little boy again as the merry-go-round is beyond repair. She talks about it with Malcolm, who sympathizes as he once lost a good friend in a similar way, but he has a little memento to remember her by. He pulls it out to show her- it's Victoria's necklace! The two friends are happily reunited, and Victoria gets her necklace back.",
