Those relics (which included the left arms of Saint Peter and Saint Paul and right arm of the apostle Andrew) account for the monastery's name. During the renewed rule of the Mamikoneans in the post-Byzantine period the monastery became a major cultural and religious centre of Taron. The history of the monastery after the end of Mamikonean rule is mostly one of Muslim raids, massacres, brief periods of abandonment followed by a re-establishment of the monastic community, and short-lived revivals. Under Ottoman rule some stability returned and the fortunes of the monastery rose, but then declined again during the Ottoman-Persian wars of the 17th century. In the 1660s an earthquake damaged most of the buildings. Massacres took place in the mid-1890s, after which the congregation was reduced to only a prior and two or three monks.",

As she and her classmates Umi Sonoda and Kotori Minami try to think of a way to make the school more attractive to prospective students, Honoka is surprised that her younger sister Yukiho wants to go to a different school, UTX, instead of Otonokizaka. As Honoka decides to investigate UTX, she finds it attracts a lot of students due a school idol group known as A-Rise. Honoka decides that the best way to save her school is to start an idol group themselves, though Umi isn't keen on the idea. As Honoka becomes downhearted, she spots a talented singer and pianist and redoubles her efforts, while Umi inevitably gives in and joins Kotori in partaking in Honoka's idea.

Just then, they catch Niko trying to steal their food and insult their lack of professionalism. The girls learn from Eri that they can't form their idol club as there is already an Idol Research Club, whose sole member turns out to be Niko. After Niko rejects their offer of merging the groups, assumedly based on their lack of personas, student vice-president Nozomi T\u014dj\u014d explains how Niko had previously attempted to become a school idol but set the bar too high, leading it to fall apart. After thinking about it, Honoka comes up with the idea that they should all join the Idol Research Club to learn how to improve \u03bc's, inviting Niko to join the group as their coach."

During the interviews, Nozomi becomes curious as to why Honoka is the leader of \u03bc's when she doesn't seem to do anything. Thus, the discussion soon turns to who should be the leader and center in the group, but they can't decide on who is the most worthy. Thus, Niko suggests that the decision be settled by a sing and dance contest at a karaoke place, though her plan to outshine everyone doesn't go very well as everyone ends up with similar scores.

        "Alejandro and Carmen offer different opinions about his new relationship, as Alejandro, who wants to keep his sexual identity a secret from the public, considers dropping his boyfriend (a \"neat freak\") after he lets him stay with him, leading Carmen to tell his lover the truth that he wants to end it. Eventually, the guy destroys everything in response, but not before seeking revenge by giving a photo of the two together to a tabloid paper; Marisol gets closer to the truth by testing the theory to see if Remi knew anything about Flora being pregnant, prompting Ida to become suspicious of Remi and warning Marisol about Michael, who happens to be the lawyer of both Remi and the supposed killer. At the same time, Taylor becomes jealous of Michael spending time seeing Olivia at the hospital, so Marisol suggest to Taylor that she should be supportive by going with Michael, who then suggests that she should keep a eye on Marisol's activities after Taylor tells him that she was eavesdropping on his phone conversation in his office room; Rosie cleans up a serious mess for Peri, who accidentally causes a hit-and-run on a jogger, who survived the incident and saw the driver. This causes Rosie to distrust Peri and causes Rosie to ask Spence if they want to be together, while Peri convinces her studio boss to help her bring Rosie's son to America; Philippe and Genevieve grow closer, but Zoila does not believe that he is changed his philandering ways, so she uses a scheme to show proof, along with a distrusting Remi learning the truth about his father after he knocks him for insulting Valentina, then whispering something in his ear (indicating that Remi knows something about Philippe and Flora). But the plan backfires as Genevieve tells Zoila that she wants to go ahead with the wedding plans.",
