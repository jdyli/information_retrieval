The respondent is a timber merchant, and in the course of his business he brings large quantities of wood, in rafts, to Carlton Place, which are there converted into sawn lumber, and, when thoroughly dried, are sent to market along the Appellants\u2019 railway. For many years prior to the origin of the present litigation, the respondent had, with a view to its being conveniently loaded of \"shipped\" in railway cars, for conveyance to market. The piles, which were stacked on both sides of the line, were 17 or 18 feet in height, from a foot to a foot and a half apart, and the face of each pile was not more than six feet distant from the nearest rail used for Appellants ordinary traffic. On 27 May 1879 a fire broke out in one of the piles on the east side of the Appellants\u2019 main line, and, spreading rapidly, destroyed a great quantity of lumber and plant belonging to the Respondent.",

In 1917 they sub-sold part of the timber on a bargain which need not be particularly specified as it was afterwards superseded by another bargain in 1920. The only relevancy of the matter is that a certain amount of timber was cut and payments made under the agreement in 1917. In 1920 the final bargain was made by which the whole of the timber limits belonging to the Company were sold at the rate of $4 per 1,000 feet. A minimum payment of $180,000 had been paid a clear title to the whole was to be given to the purchaser. The $180,000 was to be paid as follow:-$80,000 on the date of contract. On 15 January 1921, at least $50,000, or such greater sum as was represented by the $4 rate of timber by then cut, and the remaining $50,000 not later than 15 January 1922. The purchaser entered upon the limits and proceeded to cut. No dividends were paid by the Company in the earlier years as the expenses of the Company more than swallowed up the comparatively small payments made under the earlier agreement of 1917.",

The later judgment sustained an action of the appellants against the respondent Company, and enjoined the latter from doing any act which might interfere with what was held to be the vested right of the appellants to construct a dam or dams across the St. Maurice River, a tributary of the St. Lawrence. It also dismissed the intervention of the Attorney-General. The principal questions in the case are firstly, whether certain Letters patent, dated 23 February 1910, issued by the Lieutenant-governor of the Province of Quebec and forming the Charter of Incorporation of the appellant Company, of themselves gave it any right of property or to take possession for the purposes of its undertaking of the bed or bank of any part of the St. Maurice River, or of any part of the public property of the Province at the place in question.",

The Appellants, though also described as merchants carrying on business at Quebec, appear in this transaction as persons engaged in the business of lumberers in the province of Ontario. The facts which led to the suit are short and simple, however difficult the questions which arise out of them may be. It appears that in the month of July 1870 the Appellants where bringing down the St. Lawrence two rafts of timber, of which, one, consisting of six drams, hard arrived at Cape Rouge on or before the 2nd July. The Respondents being minded to deal with them for this timber, sent a culler, of the name of Gurry, to examine that raft; and upon the report which he made to them, they, on the 4th July 1870, entered into the written contract, upon which the action was afterwards brought. It is unnecessary for the present to consider particularly the terms of the contract. It contained no express guarantee for the quality of the timber, other than such as might be implied from the article providing for the rejection of certain pieces of timber falling within the description of culls, from the stipulation that all the wood should be of certain dimensions, and that the elm wood should be all rock or hard grey.",

        "This is an appeal from the Vice-Admiralty Court of Quebec in a case of collision which took place between twelve and one o\u2019clock in the morning of the 26th of July in the year 1875. The place of the collision seems to have been off Cape Rosier, in the Gulf of St. Lawrence. The ships that collided were two large vessels, the \u201cLake st. Clair,\u201d an iron ship of 1,061 tons, with a general cargo and a crew of 31 hands, bound for Montreal, and the \u201cUnderwriter,\u201d a full-rigged ship of 1,481 tons, in ballast, with a crew of 23 hands, bound for Quebec. The nature of the damage inflicted was this,-the \u201cLake St. Clair\u201d was struck at about right angles, 60 feet from the stern on the starboard side abaft the main-rigging, the bow of the \u201cUnderwriter\u201d passing between her main topmost back stays and mainmast stays. Both these vessels were on tacks beating up the River St. Lawrence, and the learned Judge of the Court below, after consulting his nautical assessor, in a judgment which bears the marks of great pains and care, came to the conclusion that the \u201cUnderwriter\u201d was alone to blame for this collision. With that judgment their Lordships are unable wholly to concur.",

The brother came to Canda as quite young men, and agreed that for their earnings they would have a common purse and in all their enterprises a common venture. They never had any articles of partnership; they never had, even by parol, any more definite terms of arrangements.
