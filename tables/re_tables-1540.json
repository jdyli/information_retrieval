When they are heading for the rescue, they are once again beaten by Bayguard, a new firm that specializes in privatizing lifeguards. When the rescue has been completed, Mitch is introduced to Alex Ryker. She is the CEO of Bayguard. Alex tells Mitch that she plans on going up against him for the county contract because Baywatch's contract is about to expire. The next day, when Mitch goes to the Chief's office, he is surprised to find Alex there. It turns out that she has shown the Chief a videotape of some of Bayguard's amazing rescues. She has also shown the Chief a tape showcasing the Baywatch team slacking off. Mitch immediately objects, but the Chief thinks that Alex's proposal warrants consideration. After his meeting with the Chief, Mitch tells his lifeguards to start acting like professionals, otherwise they will not have any jobs left by the end of the week. Meanwhile, when April sees a man having a heart attack, she calls for backup and heads for the water. But Arnold, one of the Bayguards, detains her. This upsets Mitch who brings April to Bayguard for an apology from Alex. When Mitch and April arrive to Bayguard, they see Arnold paying off a stuntman.

From there he talks to Mitch over his cell phone, and by using Bayguard's lap top computer, he finds out that almost all of the lifeguards at Bayguard are on short-term contracts. When the summer starts, Alex will be left alone with a couple of wannabees protecting the beach. But Arnold arrives to the truck and Cody is busted.

Dolphin Quest is an organization that specializes in giving young children extraordinary experience of swimming with dolphins.

Later when Cody is running down the beach, he meets Kali McKenzie, Lani's sister. She tells him that the outrigger race has been postponed due to a storm. Now Cody does not have any plans so Kali decides to give him a guided tour around the islands. When a boy falls off a cliff and ends up in a cave, Cody and Kali must work together to save him.

Before Cody leaves, he says goodbye to Kali and though they are attracted to each other, they decide to put their feelings aside. When they return to Los Angeles again, Timmy shows the painting Wyland gave him to his mother. Timmy utters the word \"Mama\" to her as he touches the painting and then his mother's heart.",

When they return to the beach, Alex goes to help them out and forgets about Timmy for a couple of seconds. Meanwhile, Timmy sees a girl getting knocked out cold by a windsurfer. He is able to bring her to shore and perform CPR before Cody and Alex arrive. Before they leave Hawaii, Timmy receives a painting from Wyland and he also gets the opportunity to see a pregnant dolphin giving birth to her baby. Before Cody leaves, he says goodbye to Kali and though they are attracted to each other, they decide to put their feelings aside. When they return to Los Angeles again, Timmy shows the painting Wyland gave him to his mother. Timmy utters the word \"Mama\" to her as he touches the painting and then his mother's heart."

        "The episode starts with someone rescuing a surfer in trouble. When the rescue has been completed, the phantom lifeguard is nowhere to be seen. A minute later, JD arrives in a lifeguard truck and he is able to see tracks in the sand showing clearly that someone else made the rescue. He tells Cody, Sheryl and Bridget about the incident. Later during a roll call, Mitch is surprised to find out that Alex has hired a new maintenance person, a girl named Jessie Owens. Everyone likes her at first, especially Cody and JD. While Cody and JD are on patrol, they are surprised to see Jessie jumping off a pier. They are convinced that the is trying to commit suicide. But they soon figure out that Jessie wants to become a stuntwoman. Jumping off the pier was just one of many tricks she has been working on. Later, it turns out that Jessie is the phantom lifeguard when she rescues a little girl named Beth and then disappears mysteriously once again. It does not take very long until everyone finds out that Jessie turns out to be a bad maintenance person. After a number of incidents, Alex has not other choice but to fire her. When Alex is talking to Jessie, she notices some scars on her arm. What's interesting is that Beth, the little girl Jessie rescued, had the same kind of scars. Later Jessie is forced to make another rescue when a future fraternity guy named Sean almost dies on the beach. When two of his future fraternity pals bury him up to his neck, he starts sinking into a sinkhole. Mitch, Alex, JD and Cody assist Jessie during the rescue. When everyone has seen for themselves what a great lifeguard Jessie is, she gets the opportunity to join rookie school that is supposed to start next week. One day, Alex approaches Mitch and tells him that she wants to come out from behind her desk. Mitch knows that she is a lifeguard and a certified paramedic, but still he lets her stay at headquarters. Much to Mitch's surprise, Ed Symes is back (8.18 \"Quarantine\"). Ed offers Mitch some free medical supplies if he lets him ride in the call car with him. To get even with Alex, Mitch lets her go with him as well. After all, she did want to get out of the office. Ed keeps bothering Alex all the time. When Sheryl calls them from her tower about a man with a possible heart attack, they drive to her tower. Once there, it turns out that the man just has cramps from a too-vigorous workout. Ed who wants to be a hero, rushes towards them with the defibrillator. Trying to save the jogger, Mitch is shocked instead. This really upsets him and to get even with Ed, he and Alex ask him to demonstrate a sling/stretcher victim. When Ed is completely tied up and helpless, Mitch and Alex leave him on the beach.",

Some workers have accidentally damaged a gas line. One of the workers drops his cigarette into the tunnel and Mitch and Hobie have to run out before it explodes. Later in the marina, Hobie meets his friends Brad, Josie and Randy. Because they are in no condition to drive, Hobie drives Brad's dad's boat. While they are driving, Josie pulls the throttle to full speed. Hobie loses control and it is just a matter of time before the boat turns over. Hobie manages to rescue everyone with the help of Jessie and April Josie ends up in a coma and Brad tells Josie's father that Hobie caused the accident. Hobie ends up in prison due to reckless driving. His bail is set at $ 300 000. Mitch pays his bail using the deed to his house along with April's money as collateral. When Hobie meets Josie's father at the hospital, he threatens to sue Hobie. The next day, Mitch has to give Hobie the bad news that he is temporarily off the lifeguard roster. Hobie leaves upset and feels like everyone has abandoned him. Mitch takes Hobie to the hospital to meet Josie who has come out of her coma. Josie tells her father the truth that she pulled the throttle. After finding out about the truth, Josie's father apologizes to Hobie. Meanwhile, Jessie is a little scared about taking tower responsibility. She is afraid she is going to lose someone just like April did (9.6 \"Drop Zone\"). When she is in her tower, Jessie has a terrible nightmare that she is guarding the beach and then everyone starts drowning and calling to her. Later the same day when she and April are supposed to pick up a ghost net, they are forced to make a rescue instead when a diver has been caught in the net. But Jessie is frozen with fear. After the rescue has been completed, Jessie announces that she is going to quit Baywatch. But Mitch talks her out of it and she decides to stay.",

Mitch is concerned about Craig's health after the rescue. He tells Craig that divorces can be tough and if he needs someone to talk to, Mitch will always be there to listen. Craig just tells him that everything is fine. Mitch and April decide that he needs to talk to Craig. Therefore he plans on taking him paddle boarding. Just before they are about to go out on their boards, Craig confesses to Mitch that he has got cancer. When Mitch confronts him, he tells Mitch that he has a rare kind of cancer called Lymphoma. The doctors discovered it early and Craig might live for another ten years. When they have paddled out, they are caught in a fog. While they are waiting for the fog to disappear, Craig starts eating a candy bar that he had stored in a compartment of his wet suit. Of course Mitch wants some and they end up losing it in the ocean. Craig tells Mitch that he is going to break up with April. He does not want her to end up without a boyfriend when he dies. But Mitch talks him out of it. Later a shark arrives and knocks Craig off his board. Craig is knocked unconscious and when Mitch has scared away the shark, he is forced to rescue Craig.

        "Craig returns to Baywatch after spending three weeks in Washington D.C. Both Mitch and April notice a change in him. Craig seems more depressed than usual. During a rescue, Mitch rescues the woman, while Craig is stuck with a 300-pound man. Craig is almost knocked unconscious by the man, but Mitch arrives just in time to bring them both back to safety. Mitch is concerned about Craig's health after the rescue. He tells Craig that divorces can be tough and if he needs someone to talk to, Mitch will always be there to listen. Craig just tells him that everything is fine. Mitch and April decide that he needs to talk to Craig. Therefore he plans on taking him paddle boarding. Just before they are about to go out on their boards, Craig confesses to Mitch that he has got cancer. When Mitch confronts him, he tells Mitch that he has a rare kind of cancer called Lymphoma. The doctors discovered it early and Craig might live for another ten years. When they have paddled out, they are caught in a fog. While they are waiting for the fog to disappear, Craig starts eating a candy bar that he had stored in a compartment of his wet suit. Of course Mitch wants some and they end up losing it in the ocean. Craig tells Mitch that he is going to break up with April. He does not want her to end up without a boyfriend when he dies. But Mitch talks him out of it. Later a shark arrives and knocks Craig off his board. Craig is knocked unconscious and when Mitch has scared away the shark, he is forced to rescue Craig. When Mitch hears a seagull, they know they are close to shore. They end up at San Clemente, an island the Military use for target practice. They are arrested by the Military and brought back home. Craig decides to give his relationship with April another chance. Meanwhile, Cody and JD get into a battle of egos. Both JD and Cody try to put up the sail in their sailboat. But both of them fail and Jessie is the one who ends up doing it. JD is working extra at a local Bally's Total Fitness club. When Cody arrives, he starts training the girls for free. This upsets JD who thinks that Cody is stealing money right out of his pocket. The two of them also decides to have a churro contest. Cody is planning on entering the Oceanside pre-Olympic triathlon.

Suddenly a woman comes out on the deck and forces her to quit. Later on, the violin-player named Ariana tries to escape from the yacht. Later Mitch and Cody decide to go back to the yacht. It\u00b4s illegal to spend the night out at sea. When they come onboard the yacht, they meet the owner of the boat, Lena Svenson. When they meet Ariana, she invites them to her recital the next day in Malibu. Wealthy industrialist Miles Clayton hosts the recital. Miles and Lena are planning on smuggling a valuable etching of a famous painting inside Ariana\u00b4s violin bow. But after the concert, Ariana runs away with the violin bow without knowing what\u00b4s in it. Cody and Mitch are surprised to find her in a lifeguard tower later on. She tells them that after her parents\u00b4 death, Lena became her guardian. Ariana believes that Lena is working for Clayton. She is tired of her restrictive life and just wants to be a normal person. Cody takes her for a walk down in Venice where he buys her one of his famous hot dogs. Then they see her bodyguards Troy and Erik, who start chasing them. Cody and Ariana run back to the tower and try to figure out why they were being chased. It doesn\u00b4t take long before they find the etching in the violin bow. They find it just before Troy and Erik enters the tower with their guns. Troy and Erik ties up Mitch and Cody in the tower and takes Ariana with them in the zodiac. When they are left alone in the tower, Mitch knocks over the first aid kit and grabs the scissors to cut them free. They start chasing the zodiac with the help of the wind jet. Alex helps them to locate the zodiac from the air in her new lifeguard invention Air Sea. An airplane that can both fly and work as a boat. When they have located the boat, Mitch and Cody start chasing them on wave runners instead. Mitch and Cody splash water into the zodiac. Eventually, Troy and Erik have to give up after a fight between the four of them.",

        "Mellowlink stows away on a train headed deep into wilderness territory where Bandits are prone to attack. The train swaps its original engine for a battle armed and armored engine as it takes on its new and all important passenger General Helumesion and Major Boil. Quietly Mr. Jui slips on board the train and coincidentally Lulucy is also travelling on the train as well. The train begins its journey and the raiders led by a Captain Ganard plot their attack. Ganard, a former commanding officer in the army is one of the many officers responsible for the misfortune that befell Mellowlink and his unit. Lulucy leaves her cabin and proceeds to the dining car for some breakfast. As she walks past the seated passengers the notices a bald obese man and turns to face him. It is her uncle General Helumesion. They exchange words as Mr. Jui observes from a distance. The conversation ends with Lulucy slapping her uncle.

Mellowlink manages to board Ganard's AT and Ganard fearing for his life rams the train, flinging Mellowlink harshly inside the train at the feet of Lulucy.
