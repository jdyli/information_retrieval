        "When Douglas is buried, Angela tries to keep Emma sedated to prevent her from testifying. Angela could lose Falcon Crest to Chase if his attorney can prove that Jason died under suspicious circumstances. When the coroner's inquest resumes, the D.A. mounts a circumstantial case that is easily rebutted by Philip when Emma is unable to testify. Defying her mother, Emma manages to escape from Falcon Crest and arrives to take the stand, confessing how she accidentally pushed Jason to his death while he fought with Turner Bates. The jury rules that Jason \"died at the hands of another,\" thereby giving Chase control of Falcon Crest, but he magnanimously offers fifty percent of the vineyard to Angela. Though Angela detests the thought of sharing Falcon Crest with anyone, she has no choice and accepts. Another threat looms as Angela learns of Douglas's illegitimate son, Richard Channing, who has inherited fifty percent of The Globe.",

From the first hour of his mission to the last rites of his funeral, the apostle was never forsaken by a generous friend, whom he delighted to name his brother, his vicegerent, and the faithful Aaron of a second Moses."

His intrepid spirit had gained him from the prophet the appellation of The Lion of God; specimens of his eloquence remain in some verses and sayings preserved among the Arabs; and his munificence was manifested in sharing among others, every Friday, what remained in the treasury. Of his magnanimity, we have given repeated instances; his noble scorn of everything false and mean, and the absence in his conduct of everything like selfish intrigue."

        "The body in the lake turns out to be that of an unknown man. Adam finds Steven's goodbye letters to Blake and Sammy Jo and burns them; however, Fallon comes across the partially charred remains and suspects her brother of treachery. After Dex expresses his unwillingness to help Alexis strengthen her empire, she takes advantage of Sable's unexpected return and her political and financially affluent friend, Hamilton Stone. Alexis persuades Stone to help her get her ships back from Natumbe, while Sable contemplates how she can benefit from their budding relationship.

        "When the Colbys return from Blake's party in Denver where the pipeline project has been made public, the first tensions start to develop: Jason's wife Sable tells him she won't put up with Conny's gift to \"outsider\" Jeff since her own three children will suffer a loss. Although Jason asks her to stay out of this, she tries to persuade her sister-in-law to give a second thought about what she has done - in vain.

From the first moment, he makes perfectly clear that he is not going to be his errand boy. Jason and his lawyer Garrett Boydston want to find out who is behind the rumors in China which made Blake Carrington believe that Colby Enterprises won't be capable to transport Denver Carrington's oil. Jason\u2019s daughter Monica offers to snoop around, but Jason rejects the suggestion of the young lawyer, obviously because she is a woman which makes her very angry. In Bakersfield, California, Conny meets her boy-friend Hutch Corrigan, who doesn't know she's a wealthy lady.

Jason finds out that his old enemy Zach Powers is behind the trouble in China. He warns Zach to keep off his business . Fallon who is still suffering from amnesia, and Miles are staying in Lake Tahoe, Nevada. She is almost raped by a drunken stranger, but Miles saves her. Jason warns his young daughter Bliss not to get too much involved with the interests of her boy friend Sean McAllister whose organization Clean Earth opposes Jason\u2019s business. Monica complains to her mother about being treated unequally, but Sable tries to make her see that her ideas are rather unlikely to come true one day. Jason and Sable are a little worried about Miles\u2019 disappearance. When the family gathers, Sable shows quite clearly that she doesn't relish the idea of Jeff staying in L.A.. Jeff doesn't care much about that, but he is pretty angry when Jason starts attacking the character of his father Philip again who had never returned from Vietnam. In the middle of their argument, Miles turns up - together with his new bride, Randall Colby.",

        "The family is very surprised about Miles\u2019 marriage and even shocked when they learn that the new Mrs.Miles Colby is Jeff's former wife Fallon Carrington. While Jason is blaming Miles for having married a girl without memory, Sable seems to be quite happy to see her son together with the daughter of one of the richest men of the country. Conny asks her friend Dr. Jimmy Lee Parris for help concerning Fallon. The psychiatrist tries to persuade the young woman to have another look at Blake's house in Denver which frightened her so much, but Fallon panics when he only mentions the idea. He tells the family not to push her to get her memory back. Blake is notified by Jeff that Fallon is alive. He comes to California, but contrary to his firm conviction Fallon does not recognize her father. Frankie arrives in Bel Air and meets her son Jeff again for the first time after many years, but must state that he still bears her grudges for leaving him with his uncle Cecil at the age of three. Conny encourages her to give him time. Miles and Jason get into a fight again when Jason wants his son to fly to Hong Kong for him and to leave Fallon in California. Blake asks Jason to take care of Fallon. Concerning business, he is less confiding as he has discovered that Jason is very likely to need Zach Powers\u2019 super tankers to transport his oil. Sable and her sister Francesca celebrate their reunion, but Sable doesn't bother to hide that she wouldn't appreciate if Frankie stayed too long in Los Angeles. At least Jason seems to be glad to see her again. Zach Powers comes to Sable's art gallery, the Colby Collection, and shows very frankly his fascination for both her paintings and herself. Before Blake leaves, he asks Conny to look after Fallon who still does not recognize him but they have become sort of friends. Sable wants to buy a Matisse for two million dollars for the Colby Collection. Jason hesitates, but finally agrees since \"life is too short.\" Monica warns Miles not to rely too much on his hope that nothing will change when Fallon will get her memory back, she doesn't want to see him hurt. Jeff and \"Randall\" have quickly become friends. He redeems the jewelry she had pawned when she came to L.A. and she responds very gratefully to this nice gesture, but Miles orders his cousin never ever to touch his wife again.",

        "On Thanksgiving Day, Dr. Maurice Boland confronts Jason with the bad news that another specialist has confirmed that he has left only six more months to live. Consequently Jason gives Miles 10% of Colby Enterprises as wedding gift for him and Fallon, but he still keeps the tragic facts about himself a secret. Frankie wants to bridge the gap between her and Jeff. She offers her help concerning Fallon, but her son keeps being very hard on her and by telling her he does not need her anymore now. Monica tries to convince Jeff that Fallon loves Miles now and that he should give up on her. Miles wants to flee the tension and suggests Fallon to take her away for a honeymoon, but she wants to stay in L.A. Frankie and Jason meet in the middle of the night and remember their very short affair they had a lifetime ago. Suddenly Sable turns up, but she obviously isn't suspicious. Miles asks his mother to stay out of his life, but Sable is determined to help him. During lunch, she tries to talk Fallon into having a baby as soon as possible, which her new daughter-in-law refuses because she feels she must first find out who she is. Sable for her part appeals friendly but very unmistakably to Jeff's reason to move out, but Conny interferes and tells Sable that this will only happen over her dead body. Jason warns Bliss\u2019 boy friend Sean not to use her for his political purposes. Sean is indignant about his behavior and get into an argument with Bliss, but in the end they forget about Jason and reconcile. On the next occasion, Sable blames Frankie for intruding into her family and her affairs and accuses her of conspiring with Conny in order to help Jeff. Frankie is determined to leave after that, but Jason manages to persuade her to stay - for his sake. Zach makes Miles present a business offer of Powers Shipping to Jason. Again father and son clash with one another, because Jason almost blames him for talking to Zach. By chance, Sable gets hold of the laboratory report of Jason\u2019s doctors and is thunderstruck. At the same time, Dr. Boland breaks the news to Jason that everything about his sickness was a computer error: He is perfectly healthy.",

Adam Carrington arrives in California, he meets Zach to discuss the possibility of using his ships in case Jason is not able to fulfill his contract. Jason is quite sour when he finds out about it and tells Adam to check with him first next time. Fallon is all confused. Dr. Parris suggests to make her remember her past by narco synthesis. Jason is informed and finally agrees with this idea. Bliss and Sable get into a little argument about her constant absence and the daughter complains that she feels shut out since she seems to be the only one without any special quality. Frankie confesses to Jeff that his Uncle Cecil kind of forced her to leave Jeff with him then. Sable encourages Miles to watch his interests and to found the \"Colby-Carrington-Dynasty\" with Fallon, but he doesn't seem to be very interested in power. So Sable takes measures herself: she wants to make Jason believe that Conny is going senile. Before a ride, she looses her saddle girth, but it terrified when Frankie takes the horse, who almost suffers a bad accident. Jeff saves her, they reconcile. Conny feels guilty for Frankie\u2019s fall, she starts doubting her own abilities. Jeff is puzzled by Adam's urgent request to see Fallon, but his sister is with Dr. Parris anyway. Monica leaves Colby Enterprises in order to start over at Titania Records, which hurts Jason very much, but she tries to make him understand that she is sick and tired of standing on the pedestal he put her on and just being treated as the boss\u2019 pretty little daughter. Under the influence of the narco synthesis, Fallon remembers the day she wanted to remarry Jeff and that she was raped by somebody before she ran away. At Titania Records Monica runs into the previous holder of her position Neil Kittredge who doesn't hide that he is sour to lose his job to her. Miles picks up Fallon from Parris\u2019 clinic. When she is confronted with Adam at the mansion, she claims to remember that he was the one who raped her then and faints.",

Jason is quite sour when he finds out about it and tells Adam to check with him first next time. Fallon is all confused. Dr. Parris suggests to make her remember her past by narco synthesis.
