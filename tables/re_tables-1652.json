So, the Widgets take him in, despite the fact that he doesn't act very grateful for it.

All are accused of involvement in the Armenian Secret Army for the Liberation of Armenia. Federal investigators identify the group as a Marxist-Leninist organization headquartering in Lebanon and responsible for bombings in Europe, Canada, and the United States. Tcharkhutian fled to France who refused to extradite him to the United States; he then fled to Libya. His accomplices face trial in December. (See 5/30/82 incident also attributed to this group.) Tcharkhutian was arrested at Los Angeles International Airport in October, 1987. In November he admitted in federal court to his involvement in a series of bombings in the U.S."

The bomb was defused by members of the Los Angeles Police Department's bomb squad. The arrests, made later in the day, were the culmination of four months of joint investigation by the FBI, Los Angeles Police Department and the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Office of a series of local bombings dating back to 1980. The three accused are Hratch Kozibioukian, his wife Stanouche Kozibioukian, and Varant Barkev Chirinian. Police believe this latest bombing may have been retaliation for the arrest of ASALA members in Canada two weeks ago. A fourth member, Vicken Tcharkhutian, was discovered in France. The U.S. request for his extradition was refused by a French court on grounds that the 1909 Franco-American extradition treaty does not cover bomb fabrication. France did expel the Armenian, however, who left for Cyprus, and thence to Libya. Tcharkhutian was arrested at Los Angeles International Airport in October, 1987. In November he admitted in federal court to his involvement in a series of bombings in the U.S."
