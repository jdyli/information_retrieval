A side door entered directly into the kitchen. Gas (copper) boiler, gas oven and hob, fitted in gas fridge were incorporated into the in built steel kitchen unts. A drop down wall fitted table adjacent to a built in larder was opposite the built in units.. Lounge had an open coal fire, the heat from which heated a back boiler, thus giving \"free\" hot water. Bathroom with a full-size bath and fitted steel cupboards. Separate toilet. Lounge and both bedrooms had steel built in cupboards and drawers. Arcons were so well fitted (in Debden, Essex) the only furniture necessary were beds, kitchen chairs, lounge seating and floor coverings. Chain link fencing, gate and a coal shed built with corrugated steel from Anderson Shelters and brick front and rear walls was also provided. Gardens were of sufficient size to grow vegetables, and many early residents quickly erected a chicken run.",

Reiga was feared and shunned due to his mixed parentage but he was supported by both Takashiro and Yomi.

Takashiro accepted the task and set off from the village, leaving Reiga and Yomi in-charge of defending the village. Before he left, however, he remarked that he would be back to witness the blossoming of the lone sakura tree (representing Reiga) which had not put forth flowers for a long time. The demon-exterminating task took Takashiro longer than he initially thought and as he rode back, he noticed a great fire devastating the village. Hearing from an injured villager that Reiga had disarmed the barrier that protects the village, allowing a horde of monsters to assault the place, he ran to Yomi's room but found her dead. He received the scar on his face as Reiga directed a beam of light while Takashiro attempted to rush to Yomi's side.

Cadenza remarks slyly that since Reiga already has 2 General-Class Opasts under him, his powers are currently split, making him weaker. Breaking the chains easily, Cadenza turns on his master as befit his title \"Master Killer\" and they exchange blows. Reiga is overpowered soon enough but as Cadenza readies the finishing strike, Luka appears and blocks the attack, saving Reiga. Telling both Kuroto and Senshiro to escort Yuki back to the mansion, Luka promises Yuki that he will protect Reiga if that is Yuki's wish. As both Luka and Cadenza release their powers in preparation for a duel, the other Zweilts appear. Cadenza aims for a sneak attack at Yuki but is stopped by Reiga, yet again coming to Yuki's aid, surprising everyone. Yuki is even more assured that it is Kanata who wants to protect him and confronts Reiga. However, Reiga mentions that it was just his plan not to kill Yuki so early in the battle and reiterates the fact that Kanata is now gone. As Yuki continues to deny Reiga's words, Cadenza finally asks Reiga where his loyalties lie.",

        "\"Communication with the Magellan spacecraft was lost early Wednesday morning, following an aggressive series of five Orbit Trim Maneuvers (OTMs) on Tuesday, October 11, which took the orbit down into the upper atmosphere of Venus. The Termination experiment (extension of September \"Windmill\" experiment) design was expected to result in final loss of the spacecraft due to a negative power margin. This was not a problem since spacecraft power would have been too low to sustain operations in the next few weeks due to continuing solar cell loss. Thus, a final controlled experiment was designed to maximize mission return. This final, low altitude was necessary to study the effects of a carbon dioxide atmosphere. The final OTM took the periapsis to km (mi) where the sensible drag on the spacecraft was very evident. The solar panel temperatures rose to 126 deg. C. and the attitude control system fired all available Y-axis thrusters to counteract the torques. However, attitude control was maintained to the end. The main bus voltage dropped to 24.7 volts after five orbits, and it was predicted that attitude control would be lost if the power dropped below 24 volts. It was decided to enhance the windmill experiment by changing the panel angles for the remaining orbits. This was also a preplanned experiment option. At this point, the spacecraft was expected to survive only two orbits. Magellan continued to maintain communication for three more orbits, even though the power continued to drop below 23 volts and eventually reached 20.4 volts. At this time, one battery went off-line, and the spacecraft was defined as power starved. Communication was lost at 3:02 AM PDT just as Magellan was about to enter an Earth occultation on orbit 15032. Contact was not re-established. Tracking operations were continued to 11:00 AM but no signal was seen, and none was expected. The spacecraft should land on Venus by 1:00 PM PDT Thursday, October 13, 1994.\""

Under the autocratic Bandinel, the staff, budget, opening hours and librarian's salary were soon increased, and he presided over significant expansions in the Bodleian's holdings: new books, foreign and early books, manuscripts, and gaps in earlier collections. Over 160,000 items were acquired between 1813 and 1837. He led the publication of a new library catalogue in four volumes in 1843 and 1851, replacing the 1738 edition. Ill health eventually led to his retirement."
