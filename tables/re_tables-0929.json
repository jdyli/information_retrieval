        "The Arrival of King Louis I in Zadar, the right scene on the front panel depicting the town walls, gates and ramparts, includes a Romanesque cloister beside a church, a contemporary ship in a storm and several figures clad in garments with caps typical of the period. Louis I triumphantly enters the Zadar harbour dressed in ceremonial robes escorting the shrine, which is being carried in the middleground, after relieving the city from an eighteen-month siege. To the left of the king are five figures kneeling humbly and above them the short-bearded figure of Archbishop Nikola Matafar blessing the king. From a historical point of view, this is the most interesting piece of work as it interprets an almost contemporary event to the making of the chest. The returning of the saint's body to the place from which the Venetians had probably removed him during their ten-year long rule, although this information is not confirmed in historical sources."

To the left stands Joseph holding a pigeon, and to the right the prophetess Anne holding an unrolled scroll in her left hand."

        "The Discovery of the Saint's Body, the scene on the left-hand side of the frontal panel shows a group of three rectors on the left bottom corner. The first has lifted a forefinger while the central figure has raised two, one in each hand. The third is pointing his left thumb over his shoulder at the other monks exhuming the body of the saint. The left monk swings a hoe above his head while the central figure kneels and holds a lantern, which shows that the scene takes place at night. The third monk is kneeling and taking care of the saint's naked body."

        "The Boat in the Storm is the scene on the right shorter side of the chest, by the saints feet, where the drama of a situation showing high waves bearing the sides of a large sailing ship and sailors jettisoning goods overboard is very expressively shown. It is believed that it interprets the story of how the bones of St. Simeon came to Zadar. A monstrous horned demon is clutching one of the two masts of the ship while two rushed sailors desperately try to fasten the sail. One has climbed up the mast and is taking a rope which the other is passing over to him. A third sailor is throwing a bundle of merchandise in the sea while the captain, on an elevated stern holding the helm, gives orders to the sailors. The frightened passengers are gathered on the center of the ship."

Meanwhile when the pipes in Muriel's darkroom begin to rattle, Henry finds out what's causing it and creates a small hole in the wall when he finds out what is causing the rattling, and a much bigger one when Henry tries to hammer a nail in the wall to hang a picture to cover the original hole; Muriel tries to talk him into hiring a plumber, but Henry balks at the prospect of paying a fortune for a professional one. Muriel finds two ex-convicts working as plumbers, as part of a rehabilitation program for prisoners, but Henry is convinced that the ex-con plumbers are going to rip them off. Jackie and Sara inform Henry and Muriel about the money, leading the Rushes to try and hide it from the plumbers; Henry decides to take it upon himself to hide the cash, leaving Jackie miffed that her father doesn't think she can be trusted with the responsibility. But when Henry creatively hides the cash separately in a tissue box and a flashlight, they worry that the plumbers might have run off with it when they discover the plumbers took the wrong flashlight, the one Henry hid $50,000 in.",
