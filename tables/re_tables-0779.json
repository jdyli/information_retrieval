Then Maura and Jane are called into the case of a man who was stabbed in the throat in the middle of a car wash. They find that the murder victim was a former football star who lost his career when a player slipped and fell and now owns a bakery with all of his ex-girlfriends. Frost's mother confesses that she's getting remarried and doesn't know how to tell Frost. Maura and Jane argue over the medical staff playing with the homicide squad during the baseball finals. During the victory dinner for the medical squad, Frost confesses that he always knew that his mother and her roommate were partners and knew she would tell her if she wanted to. Jane and Korsak find that the football game that ruined the victim's career was rigged, that the same thing happened the day he died, and that's the reason he was killed. They find that the friend he went to was actually the man that was rigging the games, so that he could win money due to the Over/Under rule. Casey comes back and tells Jane that he's going to get surgery on his spine and doesn't want her to worry, but Maura shows Jane all of the statistics behind Casey's surgery so Jane will know that he might not make it.",

When Teresa starts talking to Jane, Jane gives her the cold shoulder, because Teresa left her with a car loan. When they arrive at the murder scene, they find a female who was 'burned at the stake'. While checking the knee replacement that didn't burn, Jane questions Frankie about Teresa, they then found out their victim is Helen Downey. While investing Helen's house Jane, Korsak and Frost find an altar, and a skull, meaning that Helen was a witch. When Maura gets to Helen's house, she shows that Helen was casting an evil, love and protection spell. While looking through Helen's items, Frost and Jane find that she owned three acres of land, and she had genealogies since 1969. Korsak and Frost investigate the man who was getting the evil spell cast on him. When Jane sees that Frankie is going on a picnic, her and Maura go to spy on him. Frankie catches them spying and reveals that he has a daughter. Jane, Maura and Frost travel to a cult store, who is owned by the three people that Helen left her land to. The male leader decides to lead a seance to contact Helen from the dead to figure out who murdered her. At the seance, they ask if Helen knows who killed her, and the male leader then begins to speak in a deeper tone voice, presumably Helen, says her killer is near. At the dinner, Teresa reveals that she is working towards getting her nursing license. When Jane gets' skeptical about who the little girls father is, Frankie gets upset and insist that he is the father. Just when they are about to leave, to investigate another witch getting attacked, Jane steals the little girl's sippy cup to figure out if Frankie is the father.

When Jane orders a protective detail, she finds that Sabrina is in the middle of a psychotic break, and she's been killing the witches because that's what's going through her head.",

        "Jane is worried that Maura and Tommy might start sleeping together, when she finds out that he stayed there all night playing chess together. They are called on the case of a car with no victim, who is found out to be Melissa Black, full blood spattered all on the inside. Korsak tells Jane that she needs to go to sensitivity training, but she wants to avoid it at all cost. While Jane and Maura are at the docks, where Melissa works, the victim washes up to shore. To Maura's dismay Melissa is killed with an ice pick, the signature of her biological father, Paddy Doyle. When Maura sees that its a link to Paddy Doyle, she decides not to perform the autopsy because she wants Doyle to be put away, and not to be released because Maura is his daughter. Jane begins to get upset when she finds out that Maura and Tommy have been sending IM's to each other during the day. In the middle of a chess game, Paddy Doyle bursts into Mauras home, injured and one of his friend's demands for him to be worked on. Maura gets angry when Paddy asks her questions about her personal life, she asks him why he killed the woman at the docks, and he said that he had nothing to do with her murder. Later, Paddy Doyle's right hand man is murdered. Jane becomes worried when she can't reach Maura when the body is found. By the time Jane gets there, Paddy is long gone while Maura and Tommy are still tied up. Jane discovers that the only reason Korsak wanted Jane to go under sensitivity training was so he could get an extra day off. Later, it is discovered that Paddy's best friend killed Melissa. In the end, it turns out that the dock manager ordered the hit on Melissa. When Jane, Korsak, and Frost go to arrest the manager, Paddy had already tortured him, and left before he would get caught.",

At the end of the high school reunion one of Jane's old friends, Steve, is murdered on the football field. Korsak's ex-wife Melanie comes back after not seeing him for five years. It turns out that Steve was having an affair with an old classmate Debbie, while she was having an affair with another man who's identity is unknown. Vince's ex-wife Melanie is trying to pursue Vince to help her start a yoga business. Hours after Frost and Jane talked to Debbie she is found dead at her flower shop, and it appears to be a suicide. Maura finds that Debbie was murdered, and the rope was wrapped around her neck, to make it appear to be a suicide. Another one of Jane's classmates, Maria, is dead. Maria had a congenital heart disease, and she died from a heart attack. When Maura was investigating her heart, she pulls out a valve, that failed. The valve's company was owned by one of Jane's old classmates, who is also Steve's boss. Steve knew that the valves his boss's company was making, was failing, he planned on blowing the whistle that they were failing. It turns out that Jane's old classmate, Kate, murdered Steve, and Debbie, so that she could stay rich and live a fabulous life.",

The next day, Rizzoli is told that the murderer has escaped from a hospital before starting surgery. That night Rizzoli gets a call that some one has ransacked her apartment. When she gets there, a person dressed as a coroner lures her into his van, a man comes out of a body bag in the van and stuns her, then the first man injects her with a solution. She wakes up with her hands, and feet tied. Later, she escapes and kills the first man and gets revenge on the second.",

When they find out it happened at BCU, Maura gets very worried because that's her alma mater. The victim's best friend says that everyone loved Danielle and she doesn't know why she was murdered. The victim's father comes by the dorm room, and says she always wanted to get into BCU and got a soccer scholarship. During the autopsy Maura finds a ruptured ankle, meaning that the victim wasn't playing soccer. The soccer coach says that her scholarship had been pulled, and she was off the soccer team. Korsak finds that Danielle's tuition was paid off in full, by herself. Jane and Frost find out that Danielle broke it off with her longtime boyfriend, Brandon, a month ago. When they investigate Brandon he clams up and immediately asks for a lawyer. Jane gets a call from Angela, Maura and Jane find out that Angela traded in her car and it would cost four thousand dollars to fix. Frost finds out that Danielle made all her money by being a hooker, Frost and Jane go to a pimp to find out if he knew who she was working for. The pimp says that he doesn't know who she is but, she obviously had a book of her schedule. Jane and Angela go back to the car dealership and Jane is able to get Angela's car back, by basically threatening the owner. Maura finds out that the hair found on Danielle was from a toupee, and the piece of plastic found was from a computer.

During the candle lighting for Danielle they catch her room adviser, but not before he shoots her best friend, but luckily she lives. At the hospital Jane tells her that she won't need to sell herself for money anymore because her tuition has been paid off.",
