Meanwhile, Sei and Bach\u014d discuss about her cousin, Batai who couldn't join along with the group since she's still in training, as Bach\u014d worries about leaving her alone. Sei snickers and tells her not to worry about it. At Ry\u016bbi group, K\u014dmei notice that Ch\u014dhi carries a large box inside in which Ch\u014dhi says that she notice the box before heading off and notice the sign says 'Bentou'.

Later, Sonken apologize to Kan'u for the commotion and willing to help Kan'u. The problem is that they do not know where they place the pills as it wasn't that valuable to them and have to search in some of the storehouses. On the other hand, Sonsh\u014dk\u014d wasn't too happy about them arguing especially when she was hoping to be praise by them. K\u014dgai understands the situation and decides to talk to both of them.

Not too happy about them arguing over it, both Sonsh\u014dk\u014d and K\u014dgai came up with a plan.

Suddenly, Sonsh\u014dk\u014d locks them both inside the storeroom while K\u014dgai talks to them at the narrow window that she knew that she'll get the alcohol drink that K\u014dgai brew when Sonsaku gave birth. K\u014dgai also tells them that she's doing this for both of their own good and lets them cool off until they resolve and leaves. Spending the night in the storehouse, they manage to resolve their differences and K\u014dgai smiles as she knew they'll make amends to each other and leaves them till next morning. The next day, Sonken finally found that specific storehouse that has the Kouten pill, only realizing later that it's the same storehouse that both Sonsakue and Sh\u016byu locked up and catches them sleeping, naked. Later, after retrieving the pills from them, Kan'u bid them farewell on boat thanking them for their help.

However, as they were about to visit Sonsaku, they accidentally overheard both Sonsaku and Sh\u016byu arguing so Sonken went inside to stop the fight as they have guests. Later, Sonken apologize to Kan'u for the commotion and willing to help Kan'u. The problem is that they do not know where they place the pills as it wasn't that valuable to them and have to search in some of the storehouses. On the other hand, Sonsh\u014dk\u014d wasn't too happy about them arguing especially when she was hoping to be praise by them. K\u014dgai understands the situation and decides to talk to both of them. It turns out that they're bickering over Sh\u016byu's rare and expensive alcohol as she just recently bought it and somehow Sonsaku secretly drinks it.

So Sh\u016byu quickly rushes to one of the storehouses only to find Sonsaku who's also looking for the same thing. Suddenly, Sonsh\u014dk\u014d locks them both inside the storeroom while K\u014dgai talks to them at the narrow window that she knew that she'll get the alcohol drink that K\u014dgai brew when Sonsaku gave birth. K\u014dgai also tells them that she's doing this for both of their own good and lets them cool off until they resolve and leaves. Spending the night in the storehouse, they manage to resolve their differences and K\u014dgai smiles as she knew they'll make amends to each other and leaves them till next morning. The next day, Sonken finally found that specific storehouse that has the Kouten pill, only realizing later that it's the same storehouse that both Sonsakue and Sh\u016byu locked up and catches them sleeping, naked.

Kan'u challenge and battles her. In the end after some words from Kan'u, she accept defeat and surrenders to the Alliance. Soon, T\u014dtaku came before the Alliance and makes a bold request that they should kill her in order to make the people happy due to the false rumors that Ch\u014dj\u014d makes which ended in suffering. Kaku came in knowing about it and begs them not to punish T\u014dtaku but takes her punishment instead.

Suddenly, Kannei informs everyone that an unknown force has destroy the Kankoku Fortress. Soon they came up with a new plan to defeat Ukitsu and his army before he strike but since he's carrying the Crucial Keys and he's a powerful mage, normal blades and arrows won't hurt him. Kada do suggest if they only have the Dragon's claw as it turns into a sword and it was so powerful that it can defeat any evil enemy.
