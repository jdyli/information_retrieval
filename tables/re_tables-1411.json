        "Firebolt was once a quiet scholar on the pacifistic planet of Nebulos, where he was renowned as one of its top atomic physicists. Beneath his meek and reserved exterior, however, young Firebolt yearned for a life of action and excitement. His dreams of adventure might never have come true, if not for the intervention of the Decepticons. When the call went out for Nebulans who would be willing to take up arms in defense of their planet, Firebolt was amongst the first to volunteer. Undergoing the extensive and painful procedure known as Binary bonding, Firebolt was given a special suit of black and grey armour and granted the power to transform himself into a powerful double-barreled weapon called an \"electrostatic discharge rifle\", although eager for the chance to make a difference and have some fun, Firebolt soon found that his own exuberance paled in comparison to his Targetmaster partner: a young Autobot named Hot Rod. Firebolt's opinion of this situation is what could be described as \"cautiously optimistic\" - he is excited by all the action and adventure of being a Targetmaster, but he is also very nervous at some of the risks that Hot Rod insists on taking at times."

No license was required. From 1997 onwards, the legal definition of moped changed to \"a two- or three-wheeled vehicle having an internal combustion engine with displacement inferior to cc (cuin) and maximum factory speed of less than km/h (mph)\". The 1997 New Code of Transit also stated that any person aged 14 or older could ride a moped provided that person could read and be physically able. However, in 1998 the minimum age limit was changed to 18 years, since Brazilian Law does not allow minors to be criminally responsible, which contradicts the 1997 New Code of Transit, that states that being a criminally responsible is a requirement to be able to get a license."

Mopeds have only a 25% VAT and are therefore fairly cheap. 16 year olds can also drive 125cc bikes, and the license is only slightly more expensive than a moped license. But the 125cc bikes/scooters get a tax of about 1000-1200 Euros AND 25% VAT on top of that. Hence they cost 2-3 times as much as a moped. Mopeds in Norway used to go at least 50km/h (usually 55\u201365km/h) before adaptation of EU regulations. With the 45km/h speed limit tuning the engines are common.

        "On a lonely road quite long ago, A trav'ler trod with fiddle and a bow; While rambling thru the country rich and grand, He quickly sensed the magic and the beauty of the land. Chorus For the wonder state we'll sing a song, And lift our voices loud and long. For the wonder state we'll shout hurrah! And praise the opportunities we find in Arkansas. Many years have passed, the trav'lers gay, Repeat the tune along the highway; And every voice that sings the glad refrain Re-echoes from the mountains to the fields of growing grain. Chorus",
        "Oh, once upon a time in Arkansas, An old man sat in his little cabin door And fiddled at a tune that he liked to hear, A jolly old tune that he played by ear. It was raining hard, but the fiddler didn't care, He sawed away at the popular air, Tho' his rooftree leaked like a waterfall, That didn't seem to bother the man at all. A traveler was riding by that day, And stopped to hear him a-practicing away; The cabin was a-float and his feet were wet, But still the old man didn't seem to fret. So the stranger said \"Now the way it seems to me, You'd better mend your roof,\" said he. But the old man said as he played away, \"I couldn't mend it now, it's a rainy day.\" The traveler replied, \"That's all quite true, But this, I think, is the thing to do; Get busy on a day that is fair and bright, Then patch the old roof till it's good and tight.\" But the old man kept on a-playing at his reel, And tapped the ground with his leathery heel. \"Get along,\" said he, \"for you give me a pain; My cabin never leaks when it doesn't rain.\"",
        "Oh, 'twas down in the woods of the Arkansaw, And the night was cloudy and the wind was raw, And he didn't have a bed, and he didn't have a bite, And if he hadn't fiddled, he'd a travelled all night. But he came to a cabin, and an old gray man, And says he, \"Where am I going? Now tell me if you can.\" \"Oh, we'll have a little music first and then some supper, too, But before we have the supper we will play the music through. You'll forget about your supper, you'll forget about your home, You'll forget you ever started out in Arkansaw to roam.\" Now the old man sat a-fiddling by the little cabin door, And the tune was pretty lively, and he played it o'er and o'er, And the stranger sat a-list'ning and a-wond'ring what to do, As he fiddled and he fiddled, but he never played it through. Then the stranger asked the fiddler, \"Won't you play the rest for me?\" \"Don't know it,\" says the fiddler. \"Play it for yourself!\" says he. Then the stranger took the fiddle, with a riddy-diddle-diddle, And the strings began to tingle at the jingle of the bow, While the old man sat and listened, and his eyes with pleasure glistened, As he shouted, \"Hallelujah! And hurray for Joe!\""
