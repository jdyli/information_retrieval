He then brings Pikachu and Ash to a watermill to make Pikachu stronger. Ash battles Brock again, this time coming closer to winning. A fire breaks out in the gym, however, and the sprinklers go off, weakening Onix. Ash wants to defeat Onix but is held back by the thought of Brock's siblings (when he opens his eyes he finds he was literally held back by them). Ash leaves the Gym but Brock catches up to him and gives Ash the Boulder Badge. Flint turns out to be Brock's father and takes over the Gym and the responsibility of his children for Brock when he decides to join Ash on his journey. First appearance of Brock"

Just as this mysterious Pok\u00e9mon answers Bill's call and approaches the lighthouse, Team Rocket appears and tries to capture it. Injured, the Pok\u00e9mon loses its trust of Bill and vanishes forever, though Bill intends to keep an eye out in case it ever appears again."

As the first round ends, May, Drew, Harley, and Solidad all progress, however, Harley has set out to defeat all of them!",
        "Ash and friends finally arrive at the Indigo Plateau for May's Kanto Grand Festival. Before the competition, excitement already unfolds as Aipom returns and steals everybody's hats! With that help of Drew and a new trainer named Solidad, they manage to get the hats back. After Drew leaves, Solidad tells May how she knows Drew, and how much he talks about May. While this is going on, Brock and Max run into a cloaked figure that they suspect to be Harley. As the next day begins, May, Drew, and Solidad all pull off impressive performances, but everyone begins to wonder where Harley is. All of a sudden, Harley, dressed as May and calling himself Mayley, comes out for a Harley original appeal. As the first round ends, May, Drew, Harley, and Solidad all progress, however, Harley has set out to defeat all of them!"

        "Ash continues his battle against Brandon. With faith in his Bulbasaur, Ash manages to finally beat Dusclops. Then, Squirtle faces off against the speedy Ninjask and manages to pull off a win. Squirtle isn't so lucky when he faces down Solrock. Solrock defeats Squirtle. Ash then sends out Bulbasaur, and then Bulbasaur and Solrock knock out each other. So it comes down to the final battle: Pikachu vs. Regice. Pikachu manages to weaken Regice, but Regice uses Icebeam and traps Pikachu under a layer of ice, and using Rest, heals himself completely. Regice then freezes Pikachu inside an ice pillar using Icebeam, but Pikachu manages to break free from the ice. Using two Iron tails in a row, Pikachu weakens Regice again. Like before, Regice traps Pikachu under ice layer again and uses Rest once more. With time running out Pikachu breaks free from the trap and charges a full-power Volt Tackle at Regice. Regice manages to wake up from Rest and fires Ice Beam several times at Pikachu. But Pikachu manages to dodge the Ice Beams and attacks in time, fainting Regice.

When not dressed as a Pok\u00e9mon, he wears knickers in order to be closer to nature. Nicolai is very excited to learn that May is the daughter of the Petalburg Gym leader. He challenges her to a battle and quickly defeats her. Nicolai taunts her for losing, saying that he doesn't think her father will be difficult to beat since she is such an inexperienced trainer. Brock, Ash and May shrug off the defeat and continue on their way, but Max is furious. Without telling anyone, he goes off in search of Nicholai to defend his father\u2019s honor."

Morrison snaps out of his dilemma, and sends out Swampert who draws with Corphish after using Focus Punch against Corphish's Crabhammer. Morrison then sends out Steelix and Ash sends out Pikachu but gets defeated with Steelix's Iron Tail. Ash then sends out Torkoal who despite the advantage loses to Steelix's Dragon Breath. Ash sends out Grovyle next who beats Steelix with a Leaf Blade. Morrison then sends out Gligar who beats Grovyle after a heated match with a Guillotine. Ash then sends out Swellow who defeats Gligar with its powerful Aerial Ace. Morrison sends out Metang next which beats Swellow rather easily. Ash's last Pok\u00e9mon is Glalie. Glalie keeps using Ice Beam but it keeps getting reversed by Psychic. Finally after Ice Beam is reversed by Psychic, Glalie uses an Icy Wind to blow it back and beat Metang. Ash wins over Morrison, and moves on to the \"Victory Tournament Round 3\" (League Round 5). It is revealed that for the 5th Round Ash will be facing Tyson.

        "As the 4th Round battle, Morrison sends out Growlith but is also easily defeated by Corphish. Ash then yells at Morrison that he doesn't care about his Pok\u00e9mon and that he should just quit if he is not going to battle with his full heart. Morrison snaps out of his dilemma, and sends out Swampert who draws with Corphish after using Focus Punch against Corphish's Crabhammer. Morrison then sends out Steelix and Ash sends out Pikachu but gets defeated with Steelix's Iron Tail. Ash then sends out Torkoal who despite the advantage loses to Steelix's Dragon Breath. Ash sends out Grovyle next who beats Steelix with a Leaf Blade. Morrison then sends out Gligar who beats Grovyle after a heated match with a Guillotine.
