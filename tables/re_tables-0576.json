Marcus, a rep from the NGO meets with Chloe, Emily and Cindy, Emily\u2018s parole officer to discuss Emily\u2018s status after she was arrested for stealing medicine for Brian from the pharmacy. Cindy informs Emily that since her probation restricts her to home and the gym only, she can attend the exhibition in Denver only if she wears an ankle monitoring bracelet.

At the exhibition the girls find out that Kelly Parker is back and the Denver elite team will also be showcased at the exhibition. Austin introduces Lauren and Payson to an old friend of his named Max who seems to be immediately attracted to Payson, but she seems indifferent. The girls learn that Max is considering moving to Colorado but is trying to decide on Boulder or Denver. Lauren wanting to sink her chops into Max at first sight, suggest Boulder. Later at the exhibition party, the girls see Carter hanging out with Kelly Parker and he informs them that he has jumped ship and moved over to the Denver team.

        "Kaylie is frustrated with her stay in Rehab, and wants more than ever to get back to training at The Rock. Maeve begins to coach Kaylie on what to say to get out of rehab quicker. Steve introduces Darby Conrad, the 25 year old, two-time Olympian, and Silver medalist as the new Rock Coach. Everyone, especially Payson, is skeptical of Darby\u2018s coaching abilities.

        "Kaylie finally returns to training at The Rock, but the public is under the impression that her time away from the gym was from an ACL injury, not rehab for anorexia. Soon after, Sasha announces that Kelly Parker is going to replace Emily on the World team, and that Kaylie will be replaced, as well, since she has not had enough time to train. Lauren gets worried that Summer doesn't really want to be part of her family, but Summer assures her that that's not the case. Lauren asks Summer to adopt her so that she will be her real mother, not just a step-mother, and Summer says yes. Tessa overhears that Payson, Lauren, Max, and Austin are breaking into the gym at night to help Kaylie get her skills back, and tells Kelly, who informs Sasha. Sasha surprises the gang at the gym that night and reminds them that he can kick them all off the team for disobeying him. But he agrees to watch what Kaylie has accomplished and admits that she has improved over where she was before her illness, but that he still doesn't feel she is emotionally prepared for high-level competition. He ends up speaking with her therapist about the whole thing, and Gene tells Sasha that he wouldn't have told Kaylie that she is ready to be a gymnast again if he didn't feel she was both physically and emotionally prepared for it. The next day, Sasha announces who will be traveling with the team to Worlds: Tessa Grande, Annie Dillon, and Kaylie Cruz. Based on their training, he will choose the last member of the team at the competition.",

Sasha announces to the Rock Girls, that there is one more spot on the World team and Kelly Parker is hoping Tessa lands it. Sheila, who we later find out is Kelly\u2018s mother, stresses to Kelly that she can\u2018t afford to share the spotlight with Kaylie, there\u2018s too much money at stake. Kelly begins to try and distract Kaylie. Mark is back in Boulder interviewing for a job after his company went under, and he and Kim decide to keep the information from Payson. Austin asks Sasha for permission to work with Kaylie while she trains to get her spot back. Sasha approves. Austin strategizes a way to make Kaylie strong on one event, the vault which is Sasha\u2018s weakest link on the team. After hearing Kaylie won the spot on the World team, Sheila tells Kelly Parker that she needs to get proof of Kaylie\u2018s anorexia so that Kaylie can kiss her endorsements goodbye. Sheila feels as if Kelly let her down and that she may drop Kelly as her client. Kaylie witnesses the tail end of Kelly crying after Sheila\u2018s outburst and Kaylie lends Kelly Parker an ear and expresses concern for her now that the two are teammates. Kelly ends up hanging out at Kaylie's house thanking her for being there for her but when Kaylie asks her to stay for dinner and Kelly accepts and Kaylie leaves to tell her mother, Kelly finds her journal and reads the page that reads; \"My name is Kaylie Cruz and I am anorexic,\" she stashes the journal in her bag."

        "Sheila, Kelly Parker\u2018s mother, continues to have an overbearing presence at the Rock including blaming her daughter for allowing Kaylie to land the Healthy Bar endorsement deal. Sheila tells Kelly that she must expose Kaylie\u2018s anorexia now that Kaylie has made the World Team. Sasha continues to work with Lauren on beam and load her routine with high skill moves. Lauren agrees to trust Sasha. Marcus tells Kim that the video of Payson kissing Sasha was sent to the NGO anonymously. The unedited version shows that Sasha pushed Payson away. Kelly overhears Kaylie telling the press that Kelly Parker should be the team captain because she is the current world champ and has more gold medals than anyone else. Kelly is surprised by the class act Kaylie is. The Healthy Bar representatives presents Kaylie and her parents with their endorsement deal for a fit young woman who cares about good nutrition. Kaylie, having kept her anorexia a secret, struggles with being dishonest and misrepresenting such a campaign. Sheila seeks help to expose Kaylie\u2018s condition from Ellen Beals who has come back to exonerate herself from being investigated for the Payson/Sasha video scandal. Payson shares with Kaylie that her parents can\u2018t afford to come to Worlds and are in heavy debt. Kaylie comes up with the perfect idea for Payson to be the spokesperson for Healthy Bar instead of herself. Max agrees to work on a presentation to convince the Healthy Bar reps that Payson is their girl. At the Tanner party, Max runs to seclusion after Lauren throws herself on him sexually and Payson admits that she might be in love with him. When Austin finds Max, he\u2018s drunk and overwhelmed. Max kisses Austin and tells him he is bisexual. Ellen Beals reveals that she is being accused of the Payson/Sasha video, and tells Lauren she will never sell her out but will \"return the favor.\" Lauren is forced to tell Summer the truth about the video when Ellen Beals tips Summer to ask Steve who sent the training cam video to the NGO. Realizing that Steve and Lauren have been keeping this horrible secret all along, Summer refuses to have anything to do with either of them ever again. A devastated Lauren leaves with Max to talk about Summer's reaction, and while talking their car is hit by a SUV. While Lauren ends up fine, Max is injured.

She also gives her father the jewelry he gave her as a Nationals gift, saying how she wanted him to be just her father, not her manager. Kaylie manages to win the gold medal at Nationals while Kelly Parker has to settle for the silver medal. Lauren makes fourth place while Emily somehow makes the last member of the Nationals team. After Nationals, Leo says that he's moving back to Boulder, and Damon starts to doubt leaving Emily alone while he goes off to L.A. However, Emily reassures him by kissing him."

        "Payson has a dream that her injury wasn't anything serious enough to prevent her from training, and that spurs her into being overly complacent about her injury in front of her family and friends. Her parents worry that she's not as fine as she says she is, but they let it go, figuring she just needs some more time to adjust. Meanwhile, Kaylie is given a parade and a hero's welcome when the team returns to Boulder from the National Championships. Kaylie is overwhelmed by everything (especially the new publicity schedule set up by her manager, MJ) but she manages to take everything in stride. Lauren lets it be known that she thinks that Payson should have been the National Champion, which does not go over well with her team mates at The Rock. Lauren is determined to take Kaylie down a notch, so she goes out of her way to get Carter let back into The Rock, knowing that his presence in the gym will be enough to upset and distract Kaylie from her training. Payson refuses to set foot in The Rock again or even call her friends, insisting she has moved beyond gymnastics. She even suggests that her family move to Minnesota so they can all be together, since they were only in Colorado so she could train. Kim decides that her taking a leave of absence from running The Rock is a good idea in any case, and Summer agrees to take over for her. Nicky worries that he is responsible for Payson's injury and goes over to see her, but Payson assures him that she never took the cortisone he gave her, but there is still a syringe of it left in her locker at the gym. Unfortunately for Nicky, Lauren overhears their conversation. Eventually, even Kaylie makes it over to see Payson, and tells her that she can't handle the pressure of being #1 and wants advice from Payson on how to handle it. Payson gets very upset that Kaylie would even think of asking her for advice and Kaylie leaves crying. That night Payson destroys all of her awards and trophies from gymnastics. Damon is leaving for L.A. and wants to have one last romantic evening with Emily before he leaves, but it's interrupted when Razor comes back and finds them together. Damon admits that he has been in contact with Razor, but he never told him about his relationship with Emily.",

        "Romance is in the air at The Rock for the gymnasts and the parents as Valentine's Day arrives, and Summer suggests to Sasha that they should hold a Valentine's mixer at the gym. He reluctantly agrees to this, but disapproves when Summer asks to hold a lecture about abstinence to the gymnasts. Sasha tells Kaylie that in order to reach the needed height for her Double Arabian to beat international competitors, she needs to improve her strength. Nicky offers to help her, and the two arrive early to the gym to practice. To secure Carter's heart for her own, Lauren tries to get Nicky and Kaylie together, and insists to Payson that the two have feelings for each other. One night, Carter catches Steve with a woman when they stumble up into the attic he is residing. At school, Payson receives a Valentine's rose from who she believes is Ike, but later learns was from Heather, the school's perky over-achiever who causes Payson's pessimistic mindset to change. Tired of Ike's negative attitude, Payson ends her friendship with him, realizing that the world is full of so many opportunities other than gymnastics. Meanwhile, Summer returns to the gym one night after it closes to continue to press Sasha to let her do the talk, and explains that although she believes in abstinence she has needs herself, too. Amidst her arguing, Sasha kisses her. Sasha lets Summer do her speech because he said if he could lose control then its bound to happen to the gymnasts. Emily is distraught she has not heard from Damon in days, and finds him in prison. Damon tells Razor that he had bought a mixer he had not known was stolen to record his own songs, and Razor reluctantly bails him out from jail. Razor and Damon are heading to Razor's car after Razor bails Damon out, when Emily appears and confronts Damon. Without letting him explain, Emily breaks up with Damon. Meanwhile, as they are about to leave the gym, Kaylie tells Nicky that although they have had their moments, she values her friendship with Payson too much than to put it at risk by being involved with him. Nicky tells her that the drama at The Rock is too much for him to handle, and that he has been recruited by Denver, and has decided go there. Later on, Payson invites her new friend Heather and the girls to her house for a sleepover, and her mother is glad that she is finally adapting to being a normal teenager. Kim then gets a phone call from Sasha about a doctor who can operate on Payson's back with an experimental procedure and allow her to return to gymnastics.

He reluctantly agrees to this, but disapproves when Summer asks to hold a lecture about abstinence to the gymnasts. Sasha tells Kaylie that in order to reach the needed height for her Double Arabian to beat international competitors, she needs to improve her strength. Nicky offers to help her, and the two arrive early to the gym to practice. To secure Carter's heart for her own, Lauren tries to get Nicky and Kaylie together, and insists to Payson that the two have feelings for each other. One night, Carter catches Steve with a woman when they stumble up into the attic he is residing. At school, Payson receives a Valentine's rose from who she believes is Ike, but later learns was from Heather, the school's perky over-achiever who causes Payson's pessimistic mindset to change. Tired of Ike's negative attitude, Payson ends her friendship with him, realizing that the world is full of so many opportunities other than gymnastics. Meanwhile, Summer returns to the gym one night after it closes to continue to press Sasha to let her do the talk, and explains that although she believes in abstinence she has needs herself, too. Amidst her arguing, Sasha kisses her. Sasha lets Summer do her speech because he said if he could lose control then its bound to happen to the gymnasts. Emily is distraught she has not heard from Damon in days, and finds him in prison. Damon tells Razor that he had bought a mixer he had not known was stolen to record his own songs, and Razor reluctantly bails him out from jail. Razor and Damon are heading to Razor's car after Razor bails Damon out, when Emily appears and confronts Damon. Without letting him explain, Emily breaks up with Damon. Meanwhile, as they are about to leave the gym, Kaylie tells Nicky that although they have had their moments, she values her friendship with Payson too much than to put it at risk by being involved with him. Nicky tells her that the drama at The Rock is too much for him to handle, and that he has been recruited by Denver, and has decided go there. Later on, Payson invites her new friend Heather and the girls to her house for a sleepover, and her mother is glad that she is finally adapting to being a normal teenager. Kim then gets a phone call from Sasha about a doctor who can operate on Payson's back with an experimental procedure and allow her to return to gymnastics.

        "Payson and Heather enlist the girls help when it looks like the Taft High prom is going down the tubes. Happy to help, the girls are thrilled with the opportunity to be regular teenage girls for the night. Lauren invites Razor and Carter to come along, and continues with her detective work to find out who her father is dating. Meanwhile, Payson's parents meet with a doctor who claims she can fix Payson's back injury with an experimental procedure, and struggle on whether or not they should tell their daughter about it, when she is finally doing so well. Heather's band for prom unexpectedly cancels, and Payson saves the day by enlisting the Shelter Pups to play. In the meantime, Carter helps Kaylie improve her strength to master a Double Arabian, and with his aid, she ends up executing it. At the night of the prom, Carter asks Kaylie to dance and is rejected, but later sees her dancing with another boy. He steps in and tells her that he loves her, but if she will not forgive him, he needs to move on. To everyone's surprise, Ike shows up at the prom in a tuxedo to apologize to Payson, and the two share a dance. Emily shows up in a dress Lauren had thought her father had bought for her, and Lauren slowly comes to the conclusion that her father was seeing Chloe Kmetko. Emily is distraught when she sees Damon's band playing at the prom, and Razor asks her to dance. Upset, Damon declares to the crowd that he will sing a song he wrote for Emily, but ends up panicking and runs off the stage. Emily chases after him into the parking lot, and Damon explains to her why he turned up in jail and that he wanted to prove himself worthy for her by making a song for her. Emily tells him that just being there for her was more important than any song, and Damon decides that he doesn't deserve her, taking off. Razor comes and tells Emily that he knows that Damon loves her, and that she loves him too. He decides that he and Emily will just be friends, and leaves Emily crying in the parking lot. After the prom, Carter visits Lauren's house to pack his things, and she reveals to him her desire to feel wanted. Carter turns on the music and asks her to dance with him. Meanwhile, Kaylie deletes a photo of Carter and herself from her phone, symbolizing that she is over him. When Payson returns home, her parents finally decide to tell her the truth about the back procedure.",

        "Mark and Janis travel to Munich, Germany to speak with an imprisoned elderly Nazi war criminal who claims to have knowledge about why the blackout lasted exactly 137 seconds, and he has only one requirement: that he be set free and allowed to return to the United States where he once lived. His information does lead Mark to realize something very important about the blackout and an anonymous tip from a mysterious woman leads Demetri to believe that his lack of flashforward means he will die before April 29, which according to his source will be March 15. Mark discovers that a similar blackout had already happened in 1991 in Somalia involving the death of thousands of crows. Meanwhile, Mark's friend and AA sponsor, Aaron Stark, tries to get his ex-wife's agreement to exhume their daughter's remains and have further DNA testing to confirm if it's really their daughter when his vision shows his daughter to be alive. Elsewhere, Demetri Noh's fianc\u00e9e, Zoey, manages to return from Seattle now that flights have been re-instated but he doesn't tell her about his lack of a future vision.

Most of the flash forwards come true, albeit with small alterations here and there. Mark falls off the wagon and Wedeck is forced to bail him out of jail when the FBI building receives a bomb threat. Meanwhile, Bryce attempts to find Keiko before she is deported back to Japan. Olivia takes Charlie with her out of town when Lloyd and his son tell them that they must return to keep the scales of fate balanced. In Afghanistan, Aaron and Kahmir struggle to keep Tracy alive from her injuries. Simon and Demetri sneak into the NLAP lab to try to stop the conspirators from bringing forth another blackout. After covering for Simon and Demetri, Janis is rushed to the hospital when pregnancy complications set in. Nicole also meets her fate involving a car accident; the chain of events takes surprising turns for this to be achieved. The story lines of several characters culminate in Mark trapped at the FBI headquarters against several conspiracy assassins just after finding out when the next blackout will be... just minutes after everyone's futures will happen, but doesn't know how far into the future the next one will take... or of his own fate.",
