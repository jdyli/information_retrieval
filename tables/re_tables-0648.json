Although many tracks consist of markings on a field of suitable size, where funds permit, specialist all-weather tracks have a rubberized artificial running surface with a grass interior (as shown in the picture and diagram). The perimeter of the inside kerb of the track is a little under 400metres, as the actual length of the track is measured 300mm from the inside kerb. The IAAF specifications state that the radius of the kerb is 36.5m, from which it can be calculated that the area inside the kerb is 1.035ha. The soccer field often found inside is normally 105*70 m, that is 0.73 hectares."

The first years however, are fed up with P.E. and chanting, so Miss Bat and Miss Drill persuade Mrs Semolina to teach a cooking lesson. This ends in disaster when Sybil and Clarice use the opportunity to lace the salad dressing with a dancing potion. Soon, the staff is helplessly and wildly tangoing around the staff room. Sybil and Clarice pretend to make amends for this catastrophe by inventing a magical everlasting light to replace the candles. However, they are really inventing a magic lamp in an attempt to make all of Sybil's wishes come true. The side-effects are disastrous, and the castle is nearly destroyed \u2013 until Clarice has an inspiration."

        "Mr Blossom's nephew Charlie has arrived for another weekend visit to Cackle's. He is fed up with his own school and jealous of the fun the girls seem to have at the Academy, so he persuades his uncle to ask if he can become a pupil at the Academy. The Academy is busy planning celebrations for the commemoration day of their founder, Great, Great, Great Granny Cackle. Miss Drill seems sympathetic to Charlie's request but Miss Hardbroom is dead set against it, despite Miss Cackle wondering if it might not be time for the Academy to go coed. In the end, Cackle decides that Miss Hardbroom should give Charlie one of her tests as a way of proving his worth. She gives Charlie a math test, and as he's failing miserably, Mildred comes to his rescue with a spell. It gets out of control and has magic numbers flying everywhere. Charlie's hopes are dashed until Fenella and Griselda turn up with a book, which states that every boy who turns up at the founder's day feast must be automatically accepted into the Academy. To keep him from having to go home before then, Enid decides to give him a magical case of the flu. This turns out terribly for Charlie, and Miss Bat's herbal cure makes him feel even worse. Miss Hardbroom then catches them in the act and announces that she knew what they were doing all along. Charlie however, doesn't think it's much fun to be a witch anymore, although he enjoys being allowed to stay for the Founder's Supper.",

        "A few weeks into the term, and homesickness is taking its toll on the first years. Part of their problem is the food \u2013 liver in cold, greasy gravy, fish with gazing eyes and lumpy milk puddings. As a result, they have resorted to eating too many sweets. Miss Cackle decides that the only answer is to set an example by eating exactly the same food as the girls for a week. Meanwhile Mrs Tapioca, the school cook, comes to Mildred's rescue and invites her down to the kitchen to sample her fresh pasta and pizzas. Mildred spots an extraordinary contraption, which Frank Blossom has created for catching mice. She also notices an interesting cupboard, which Mrs Tapioca tells her is where the staff keep their own food. Mildred has an idea and later she suggests to the others that they have a midnight feast.

        "Mildred is looking after 'Bonzo', who is Ruby's cyberpet. During a potion lesson to make the elixir of life, Mildred drops Bonzo into her potion, which overflows onto the desk and floorboads. They then come to life as trees and destroy the potion laboratory, after which Bonzo goes missing. Miss Cackle seizes the opportunity for a complete modernization of the laboratory and decides to invite the Chair of the School Governors (who happens to be Mr Hallow, Ethel's father) to inspect the damage and hopefully pay to re-equip the laboratory. Mr Hallow arrives at the academy and convinces the teachers to set up a computer system. Meanwhile, Bonzo makes his return, but he has been affected by magic as a result of the potion lab's destruction. Bonzo connects up to the computer system and uses it to hypnotize everyone, to try and help him enslave the world when the system is connected to the Internet. Mildred becomes concerned that her friends are becoming zombies at the mercy of the computers. Fenella and Griselda draw her attention to an old fairy book and tell her the story of the Snow Queen who places a splinter of glass in Kay's heart, which puts him under her power. The comparison is obvious and Mildred looks for a spell that could undo the attention of the computers. Mildred's enchantment works on Ruby and Miss Hardbroom and, in the nick of time, Miss Hardbroom saves the day.",

The girls meet a nature-loving businessman named Sam, who has trouble standing up to his overbearing boss, Percy Slyce. Meanwhile, Miss Cackle is already at the tearoom. Unseen by her, the girls settle down at a table where they overhear Slyce's plan to trick the tearoom's owner, Mrs Cosie, into selling so that a toxic incinerator can be built on the site.

So that she could seize power, Anna overthrew her mother and imprisoned her for the past 15 years, allowing the rest of their race to believe she was dead. Anna asks her mother about understanding human emotion and the human soul which she considers to be humanity's greatest defense as it empowers people. Diana discovers through Anna that Earth is the last viable planet close enough where the Visitors can continue their species, but tells her that using humans for breeding purposes will only ensure that the next generation of Vs have emotions and that she will be unable to control them. Meanwhile, Erica has Tyler's blood analyzed as she believes the Visitors may have done something to her when she was pregnant with him 18 years earlier. Ryan seeks advice from Father Jack regarding whether or not he has a soul, while Anna tries to lure him back to her side by giving his daughter an illness. Chad is a target of a Fifth Column attack. Erica and Agent Malik follow a lead where they both become suspicious of each other leading to a struggle which causes their vehicle to crash.",

So that she could seize power, Anna overthrew her mother and imprisoned her for the past 15 years, allowing the rest of their race to believe she was dead. Anna asks her mother about understanding human emotion and the human soul which she considers to be humanity's greatest defense as it empowers people. Diana discovers through Anna that Earth is the last viable planet close enough where the Visitors can continue their species, but tells her that using humans for breeding purposes will only ensure that the next generation of Vs have emotions and that she will be unable to control them.

When Anna learns that Malik is missing, she orders Ryan to find her. Anna also asks Chad to interview Jack and uses it against him when she sends a V to his church to provoke a fight, which is caught on video with the help of Tyler, making Jack look violent. Malik refuses to give answers to the Fifth Column until she gets skinned, finally giving Erica information regarding a young runaway girl whose life is in danger at the hand of the Visitors. Erica learns that Tyler's DNA is incomplete and realizes that the Visitors did this to him while she was pregnant with him, but wonders why. Lisa realizes her body is beginning to change as she approaches the breeding phase of her life. Anna tells her to embrace the changes, and tests Lisa by forcing her to kill a human that they are experimenting on.

Anna visits Diana again as she continues to look for a way to isolate the soul in humans, and gloats that Lisa is approaching the breeding phase of her life. However Diana warns Anna that her daughter will eventually turn on her, much like Anna turned on Diana. Anna reveals to Tyler that she considers him to be like a son. When Chad finds out he was used by Anna, Jack introduces him to the Fifth Column members.

Erica and Hobbes then head to Hong Kong to confront the doctor who cared for her and Cohn's wife during their pregnancies. They confront the doctor, who turns out to be a Visitor, but she commits suicide rather than answer their questions. In her safe, they discover evidence of 29 survivors of the V's genetic experiments (one in each of the cities visited by motherships), including Tyler. With this new information, Sidney is finally able to uncover the V's master plan: to fast-track their own evolution using the best human DNA they can find. Meanwhile, Anna discovers that Tyler's phosphorus levels are abnormally low. When Joshua is unsure he can boost Tyler's phosphorus, Anna dispatches Rafael (who has the best clinical data among the 29 subjects) to the New York mothership, and asks Lisa to \"entertain\" him. Lisa and Diana begin to bond, uniting against Anna. Diana warns Lisa not to trust anyone on board the mothership, and not to reveal her emotions. However, she cannot continue her courtship of Rafael, due to her feelings for Tyler. Anna begins to doubt Lisa's loyalty, and asks Joshua to test her. She also reveals to Joshua that she has saved one last queen egg, so that she can replace Lisa if she should fail. Joshua warns that they need to accelerate the new hatchling's growth if they are to succeed. Anna then asks Joshua to experiment on Ryan's hybrid child. As a result of the experimentation, the child has aged quickly but is now immune to the pain that they initially gave her, and she no longer needs Anna's Bliss. Erica and the Fifth Column realize that the last batch of live-aboards will be transported to the motherships soon, and Anna will have all she needs for her breeding program.

When Joshua is unsure he can boost Tyler's phosphorus, Anna dispatches Rafael (who has the best clinical data among the 29 subjects) to the New York mothership, and asks Lisa to \"entertain\" him. Lisa and Diana begin to bond, uniting against Anna. Diana warns Lisa not to trust anyone on board the mothership, and not to reveal her emotions. However, she cannot continue her courtship of Rafael, due to her feelings for Tyler. Anna begins to doubt Lisa's loyalty, and asks Joshua to test her. She also reveals to Joshua that she has saved one last queen egg, so that she can replace Lisa if she should fail. Joshua warns that they need to accelerate the new hatchling's growth if they are to succeed. Anna then asks Joshua to experiment on Ryan's hybrid child. As a result of the experimentation, the child has aged quickly but is now immune to the pain that they initially gave her, and she no longer needs Anna's Bliss. Erica and the Fifth Column realize that the last batch of live-aboards will be transported to the motherships soon, and Anna will have all she needs for her breeding program. As a result, they plot to stop the last batch from arriving on board the mothership."

        "Erica, now in command of the Fifth Column worldwide, spearheads a hazardous attack against Anna by planting a virus into certain candidates of the Visitor's live-aboard program. The virus alters the DNA of anybody infected with it, therefore making the DNA worthless to the Visitors for use in the masterplan. However, one of the live-aboard candidates collapses just after boarding Anna's ship and, in the ensuing investigation by Joshua and Thomas, Anna uncovers Erica's plan. Consequently, all live-aboard residents that contained the virus are killed, and their DNA disposed of to avoid infecting the V's stockpile of viable human DNA. To cover up these killings, Anna reports that members of the Fifth Column had infiltrated the live-aboard program as suicide bombers. Realizing that the Fifth Column not only still exists but appears to be more organized, Anna dispatches Thomas to locate the new head of the organization. Meanwhile, Ryan attempts to rescue his daughter from the mothership, and is introduced by Lisa to his former queen, Diana. Diana instructs Ryan that she has secret escape shuttles hidden on the mothership. Ryan manages to escape, but without his daughter. All parties are unaware that his daughter is now immune to the painful illness that Anna inflicted on her, but Diana promises to bliss Ryan's child. Diana also tells Lisa to speak to Marcus, one of her former loyal confiders, who is still recovering from the assassination attempt.

But the group is unaware that \"weapon grade\" blue energy is being produced and their sabotage plans will actually destroy everything within 100 miles. Acting on a tip from Lisa, Ryan gets to the reactor just in time to deactivate it.

During the exchange, it is planned that Lisa will kill Anna, but Anna tricks her into thinking that she has decided that humans and Visitors should live in harmony and Lisa does not kill her as planned. Ryan and Joshua free Diana, who reveals herself to the other Visitors. Anna then sneaks up from behind her and kills her with her tail. Lisa is then imprisoned in Diana's former dungeon. Anna's queen egg hatches and the offspring has skin put on to look exactly like Lisa. Thinking she is the real Lisa, Tyler mates with her, after which the fake Lisa kills him while the real Lisa is forced to watch from her dungeon. Meanwhile, Ryan finds his daughter Amy, who has now matured to the level of an 11 year old girl, and tries to convince her to escape the ship with him, but instead, Amy strangles him with her tail and appears to break his neck. Erica finds Hobbes is missing, but is then kidnapped and taken to a secret underground bunker a mile underneath Manhattan. The huge bunker houses Project Aries, a secret cabal of top ranking global military and government officials (including Erica's FBI boss Paul, and new partner Chris) who have long suspected the Visitors' real intentions and are preparing for a war with them. Upon reviewing video of the fake kidnapping of Lisa, Anna discovers Chad was involved and requests that he be brought to see her. Later, Anna tries to put Bliss on the whole world but it again causes her immense pain and makes her eyes bleed even more than ever. Amy sees what Anna is doing and tells Anna that she can Bliss the world for her, which she does. The only people who do not appear affected are those inside the underground bunker at Project Aries. Erica emerges from the bunker to find that everybody, including Jack, is under the control of the Bliss. More motherships reveal themselves across the globe, threatening to enslave humanity forever.",

A worried F\u016bma tells Kamui he also had the same nightmare, and requests him to tell him why he left Tokyo six years ago. Kamui says that after Saya died, his mother T\u014dru took him to Okinawa where Kamui started experiencing his psychic powers.

Outside the shrine Sakura glows and opens the door to reveal the Ashura statue surrounded by fire, where Fai and Kurogane are, the Yasha statue is surrounded by ice. As the sky cracks to open into another world, caused by Mokona, the Suzuran troupe arrive and bend over the statue hoping that the earthquake is not Ashura's fault. Her tears fall onto the statue and it flashes and both statues clear the confusion above their heads so that the other world can be seen clearly. Mokona then transfers them into that world, but they are still separate. Sakura and Syaoran end up on a battlefield with a being who is identical to the statue and who bears the same name.

        "On the moon castle Ashura kills Yasha, he fades away and one of Sakura's feathers is left. Sakura joins him on the castle and Ashura explains to them. Yasha had died a long time ago, the feather created an illusion to replace him. When Ashura and Yasha were fighting, Ashura somehow managed to wound him in his eye even though they were equal. This was because Yasha was ill. One day he came to Shura castle. It was impossible to meet him anywhere but on the moon castle. It was his soul, Yasha had died. He came to say goodbye to Ashura before leaving for the next world. Then the feather came to replace him with a mirage. This was painful for Ashura to see him even though he had died. Ashura returns the feather to Syaoran. She stands up and plunges her sword into the ground to claim the moon castle to grant her wish. The castle simply begins to crumble because her true wish, to have Yasha brought back can never be fulfilled as there is no way to revive the dead. Syaoran and company make it back but Ashura wishes to stay behind. She makes one last wish to the Time-space witch. To have her and Yasha as the gods of the next world, to prove that not even gods can do everything. Syaoran asks the Ashura clan to bury the two together and not apart as he and the others are taken back to Shara. It turns out Fai and Kurogane were pretending to be ones from another world so Syaoran would fight Kurogane to improve his sword skills. They find Shara very different as the two sides are no longer opposing each other, The two statues are together and a wedding is taking place.",

As Miss Cackle evacuates the Academy, Mildred asks Miss Hardbroom for help, claiming that she has a plan to discover which is the real Lucy Fairweather.

        "It is time for the dreaded Third Year Witch Project. Ethel makes a miniature broomstick to carry objects and messages, but is struggling to control it when in flight. Mildred and Ruby develop a summoning spell to find lost objects. Enid is trying to make a potion that restores the flavour to used bubble gum, but is ordered to abandon it when the gum floats across the school and bursts all over Miss Drill. After a fall out with her friends, Enid teams up with Drusilla to make a spell to change hairstyles instantly, but accidentally turns Miss Hardbroom into a goth during testing. After this, Ethel and Mildred's group agree to share research to solve each other's testing problems. During the demonstration ceremony in the Great Hall, Ethel's mini broom once again goes out of control, and Mildred tests her summoning spell on it. It then proceeds to attack her, until Enid transforms Mildred into a goth so it doesn't recognise her. Enid and Drusilla are awarded the Bullfrog Prize for producing a useful and injury-preventing project."

        "When Miss Cackle has to leave the school to visit her sick aunt, Mr Hallow brings in a temporary Headmistress to take her place. The replacement is none other than Mistress Hecate Broomhead, the dreaded former OFWITCH inspector who tried to close down the Academy the previous year. Broomhead is a stickler for saving time, and orders large clocks to be put up around the school. She also makes Mildred wear an electronic tagging device so she can monitor where she is at all times. Meanwhile Ruby has been inventing a device that allows you to be instantly transported from one place to another, and Mildred agrees to test it out as a way of avoiding Mistress Broomhead's monitoring. However the device malfunctions and transports Mildred to random locations across the school. While outside, she overhears Mr Hallow planning to give Miss Cackle early retirement and make Mistress Broomhead the permanent Headmistress. Broomhead discovers Ruby's transportation device, and is highly impressed, believing it could save a great deal of time moving between places. She asks for a demonstration, but the device once again malfunctions, causing Broomhead to be teleported at lighting speed around the room, which she thoroughly enjoys. Miss Cackle then returns, having been sent for by the other teachers, and reverses all the changes Mistress Broomhead made.",

Later, Mildred and her friends are summoned to Miss Cackle's office, having been discovered as the source of the derogatory newspaper. As punishment for leading the rebellion, Miss Cackle expels Mildred and Jadu from the Academy."

        "Following the rebellion against Cackle's Academy, Mildred and Jadu have been suspended from the school. Until their parents come to collect them they are forced into isolation, copying out chapters of the 'Historica Magica'. Maud decides she will run for Head Girl to get Mildred and Jadu reinstated back in the school, but realises this won't be easy when she discovers that Ethel is also running. The girls have the idea that if Mildred had the opportunity to save the school from destruction, as she had done before, then it would count in her favour and Miss Cackle would reinstate them. They then decide to summon a mythical monster from a dangerous book called the 'Mytheocopia' with the intention that Mildred and Jadu would save the day, but the plan goes horribly wrong when they accidentally summon 'The Uninvited'- an evil witch who sets about putting everyone in the castle into a deep sleep. Meanwhile, Mildred has been sketching 'Prince Percy', a historical character from the book she is copying out, to help pass the time. She then discovers she has the ability to bring her drawings to life. After hearing about The Uninvited, Mildred brings her drawing of Prince Percy to life. Mildred, Jadu and Drusilla then use Prince Percy to wake everyone who has been put to sleep with a single kiss to the lips. After waking Miss Hardbroom, they proceed to the Great Hall where The Uninvited has just put Miss Crotchet to sleep. Miss Hardbroom battles the evil witch but is overpowered, and it is left to Mildred to save the day by returning The Uninvited to the Mytheocopia using her special ability. Later at the Head Girl election, on Maud's request, Miss Cackle makes Mildred Head Girl and Jadu Deputy Head Girl in recognition of their efforts in saving the Academy once again.",

        "When Al Stempo and his wife Maria purchased a 200-year-old building to open a new restaurant and bar, they had no idea they were buying a place that was rumored to be haunted. When several strange, unexplained incidents occur, Al and Maria brushed them off. But when their beloved Yorkie disappears into the basement and the family Doberman has a vicious reaction to the restaurant's basement, Al and Maria decide to search for answers. They discover that the building was once the home to a notorious gangster who was shot and killed in their basement by a worker at the restaurant. With the revelation of compelling evidence discovered by paranormal team NEPA Paranormal, the Stempos come to believe that their building is indeed haunted by the gangster and that he is after their pets. Later, Rob Viars never took more than a passing interest in the history of his home until several frightening events forced him to take a closer look.
