The winner of each round would earn $5,000 for their charity. Each team captain picked their champion, and the team that won the previous challenge would get to pick the cuisine to be cooked in the next round. As the Yellows won the previous challenge, team captain Kate got the first cuisine and contestant pick. She pitted herself against Julie and Jonathan in Lebanese food. Jonathan produced a bad dish, while Julie managed to snag a win. Julie then picked Poh to go up against Marion and Dani in Chinese. Dani scored a surprising win with her modern take on a traditional Chinese dessert. Kate then let Kumar take on Aaron and Chris in Indian cuisine, with Chris' sophisticated salmon dish taking the prize over top favourite Kumar's mussel curry. Justine, Callum and Hayden were assigned French cuisine by Julie, and it was Callum's dish that pulled off the first win for the Reds.",

The dish they would have to revisit would be determined by a random draw from a knife block. It turned out to be an all-dessert challenge as every contestant drew a tricky dessert from the block. For Justine it was the Warm Peach Tart from the Celebrity Chef Challenge against Matt Moran (episode 44). For Chris, it was Zumbo's Vanilla Panna Cotta with Macaroons from Week 11's Pressure Test (episode 61). For Julie, it was her Passionfruit Puddle Pie from a Finals Week Elimination (episode 67) and for Poh, it was Matt Moran's Chocolate Tart from the Grand Finale. Poh and Chris got 2.5 hours to cook as their dishes were more intricate, while Julie and Justine had to wait on the balcony for an hour before their cooking time started. All three dishes showed great improvement from their season 1 counterparts, but Julie and Poh's were considered the top two. Though the judges considered both desserts virtually flawless, it was a split-hairs decision due to Poh failing to perfectly temper her chocolate on her highly technical dish. Julie won the $10,000 for Oxfam, but she decided to split it with Poh due to how close the decision was.",

Surprisingly, Callum also took the win in the beer round with his Stout Panna Cotta. Beer lover Chris got 2 points, Justine got 1. With Callum at 6 points and the others both at 3, he became technically unbeatable for points and therefore didn't have to cook in the final round. Chris was pitted against Justine in her favourite ingredient chestnuts. With both delivering an excellent dish according to the judges, they had to make a split-hairs decision to determine the winner. Chris came out on top, and Justine was eliminated.

        "On the search for more team members to fill the three empty spots on Estrella, Leon travels to Sant Miguel, a city in the wastelands. It is rumoured that a strong and aggressive wheeler nicknamed 'Strong Armed Outlaw' is going around there. In fact, a gym has only recently been destroyed and both Leon and gym member Covey Horn head to track down the culprit, who reveals himself to be Jake of the Dominators. Covey then decides to battle Jake for the honor of his comrades, while forcing Leon to be somewhat of a judge. Covey uses his great strength to try and simply overpower Jake, but Jake's slithery tactics are able to outmaneuver Covey's Bull at every turn. Finally, Jake finishes off Covey with his special move, Poison Bite, proving Covey no match for the Dominators wrath. Jake tries to continue to destroy Bull, but is stopped by Leon's Wheel, Leone. Leon challenges him to a battle at sunset. In the time left until then, Covey mourns over the gym and shares the story of his past with Leon. Covey was originally a Wheeler looking to pick a fight just for a battle, defeating everyone he came across in an out of control rage until he came to West Gym. There he was defeated by a Wheeler named Antonio, who showed Covey kindness and got him accepted into the community, making West Gym Covey's home. This is where Leon learns that Covey is the Strong Armed Outlaw, and tells him of the battles to come with the Dominators. The time frame has passed and Leon moves on to battle Jake, raising the stakes to where the loser is exiled from Sand Miguel forever. Once again Jake is able to outmaneuver brute force using Serpent's abilities, but Leon is not moved by Jake's skills, rather he is infuriated by Jake's underhandedness. Even in fury, Leon is still one step behind Jake who continues to barrage Leone without mercy and nearly knocks it out of the stadium, with his special move. However, Leon was waiting for this moment to set up for his own special move and turn Jake's tactics on him, defeating him with the attack and expelling him from the town. Leon leaves town, but not without Covey following close behind, hoping to become strong under Leon so he can protect what he loves, just as Leon did on that day.",
        "On the search for more team members to fill the three empty spots on Estrella, Leon travels to Sant Miguel, a city in the wastelands. It is rumoured that a strong and aggressive wheeler nicknamed 'Strong Armed Outlaw' is going around there. In fact, a gym has only recently been destroyed and both Leon and gym member Covey Horn head to track down the culprit, who reveals himself to be Jake of the Dominators. Covey then decides to battle Jake for the honor of his comrades, while forcing Leon to be somewhat of a judge. Covey uses his great strength to try and simply overpower Jake, but Jake's slithery tactics are able to outmaneuver Covey's Bull at every turn. Finally, Jake finishes off Covey with his special move, Poison Bite, proving Covey no match for the Dominators wrath. Jake tries to continue to destroy Bull, but is stopped by Leon's Wheel, Leone. Leon challenges him to a battle at sunset. In the time left until then, Covey mourns over the gym and shares the story of his past with Leon. Covey was originally a Wheeler looking to pick a fight just for a battle, defeating everyone he came across in an out of control rage until he came to West Gym. There he was defeated by a Wheeler named Antonio, who showed Covey kindness and got him accepted into the community, making West Gym Covey's home. This is where Leon learns that Covey is the Strong Armed Outlaw, and tells him of the battles to come with the Dominators. The time frame has passed and Leon moves on to battle Jake, raising the stakes to where the loser is exiled from Sand Miguel forever. Once again Jake is able to outmaneuver brute force using Serpent's abilities, but Leon is not moved by Jake's skills, rather he is infuriated by Jake's underhandedness. Even in fury, Leon is still one step behind Jake who continues to barrage Leone without mercy and nearly knocks it out of the stadium, with his special move. However, Leon was waiting for this moment to set up for his own special move and turn Jake's tactics on him, defeating him with the attack and expelling him from the town.

The mysterious leader of the Dominators promised him to fill the emptiness in his heart, which is why Odin ultimately ended up joining the team. For this present battle, Odin insists on a normal stadium that gives him no advantage. An electric wall preventing stadium outs is the only addition made. While early in the battle, the speed of Odin's Destroyer seems to be giving him a huge advantage, Sho refuses to lose this easily. The longer they fight, the more fired up Sho seems to become. Odin's hand starts trembling as Sho is giving him some trouble. Odin realizes what a real battle is - a competition that pushes both Wheelers to their limits. Both Wheelers decide to use full power on each other. Now all of the audience are cheering for Show and Odin both. Finally, both use their special move, causing an explosion that destroys a huge part of the stadium. The bey still spinning afterwards turns out to be Pegasus. The winner of Judgement Bey is Team Estrella with 3 matches won. Sho walks over to Odin and offers his hand out for a hand shake. Odin is about to shake back, when Leader A and B appear.

Later in Season 4 she infects Allison Blake with nanites so as to take control of her mind, and to enable Beverly (acting as Allison) to steal the GD main computer core. Her plan is foiled, and the nanites are removed from Allison's brain. In Season 5, she is revealed to be behind the kidnapping of the Astraeus crew, though later helps Carter and others at Global Dynamics recover them. Following an anonymous tip from Beverly, Henry's wife Grace is released from government custody."

Henry's assistance is often invaluable in defusing the situations the experiments in town create. In the Season 1 finale set in 2010, Henry is married to Kim, and attempts to save her life by traveling back in time to the point where she died. Her death cannot be prevented, and Henry mourns her loss. During Season 3, he was elected mayor as a write-in candidate.

        "In the final episode, Rae is in a very dark place following Tix's deterioration. When she meets the gang in the Fish and Chip shop for a 'de-brief', Chop and Archie leave- and she finds herself feeling awkward after witnessing the kiss between Chloe and Finn. While Finn is in the bathroom, Chloe tells Rae that she has actually started to develop real feelings for Finn. She has a daydream about running Chloe over with a truck, but it is broken when Finn returns. The three sit in silence until Rae decides to leave, forgetting her bag. After she tells her mother she had seen Karim with another family, she finds out that Karim had not cheated on her mother, and that it was just his sister and her children. She finally realizes that she has left her diary at the Fish and Chip shop. When she goes to get it back, the woman behind the counter tells her that her friend took it for her. She runs to Chloe's, but is too late as she has already read it, and Rae is alienated from the group. Rae becomes gradually more and more depressed from having no one to talk to, and tries to commit suicide, only to be run over by a car. She enters a dream like state in which Tix acts to be some sort of guardian angel and shows her what the world would be like without her. After being told that she is in a coma and that her mother, Karim, and Finn are at her beside, she agrees to wake up, only to find she is not in a coma, but still lying on the side of the road. One of the boys that had previously bullied Rae shows remorse for running her over and drives her to the hospital. Rae then goes to see Kester, and they have a heart to heart about Rae's father, who is not around, and about why she had just tried to commit suicide again. He tells her to go to her mother's wedding reception and Rae agrees, changing into the dress her mother had bought her. After Chloe tells Rae to stay away from her and her friends at the reception, Rae decides to give a speech and finally reveals the truth about herself. Chop reveals how he feels about Izzy, and Archie tries to reveal the fact that he is gay, but decides against it. Rae and Chloe make up, Chloe stating that Finn is not interested in her. When she goes looking for Finn, she finds him at the Fish and Chip shop and he tries to tell her something, but fails, so instead he uses their special language and writes \"I love you\" on her back. She tells him not to say it if he doesn't mean it, but he confirms that he doesn't care if she believes him or not, implying that he does in fact love her. The next day, Rae starts to make an effort to connect with Karim, and they share a tender moment in which Karim tries to explain about the birds in English, but soon converts back to French as he has no clue how to speak English. Rae goes back to Kester for her sessions, and asks whether she needs to be admitted again as she had tried to kill herself. He replies with, \"No,\" so she asks whether she is better to which he replies again, \"No.\" He then goes on to tell her she is in fact ready for therapy. Rae smiles knowing that she is one step closer to getting better.",
