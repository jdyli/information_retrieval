        "Following his collapse, Hardy awakens in the hospital and continues with the investigation, despite the growing concerns, suspicions and outrage of those around him, especially Ellie. With Susan in custody, they commence questioning and she reveals, eventually, that she saw Nige place Danny's body on the beach. The Reverend Paul Coates tells Hardy that Tom and Danny were not getting along and gives him the smashed laptop that he recovered from the boy. Meanwhile, Maggie and Olly plot to get the scoop on Hardy's health issues and attempt to dig into his past. At dinner, Dean, Chloe's boyfriend, reveals to the Latimers that Danny had been going with Nige and him to the farm some evenings to catch animals. He was under the impression that Mark knew and had condoned this. It is revealed that Susan knows Nige to be her lost son, and the story involving her family is explained. Hardy agrees to an exclusive interview and, to the Echo writers' surprise, reveals the painful and complete story surrounding his past and the failed Sanbrook case. The two interviewers are left speechless and with much more respect for Hardy. As the case begins to come together and the secrets of every character are explored, Hardy pushes harder and harder to be sure that this case is solved.",

        "The episode begins with Chris being locked up in jail for hosting the past season at a radioactive location. It has been one year since the last season and Chef comes in to say that his time is done and that his contract states that Chris has to do another season. Chris is very happy for his release and the new Season 5 intro begins. Now Chris is at the island next to his personal robot and he then introduces thirteen returning contestants: Cameron, Courtney, Duncan, Gwen, Heather, Jo, Lightning, Lindsay, Mike, Sam, Scott, Sierra, and Zoey. Chris considers all of these characters as \"all-stars\", and some of the cast are happy to return, while others are brought back by force, like Courtney. Later on Chris announces that they are going to compete again for another million dollars \"Heroes vs. Villains\" style, and then places the cast into two teams, which are the Heroic Hamsters and the Villainous Vultures. Cameron, Courtney, Lindsay, Mike, Sam, Sierra and Zoey are placed onto the heroes team while Duncan, Gwen, Heather, Jo, Lightning and Scott are placed onto the villains team. Gwen is mad that she is considered a villain but Duncan is happy that they are both on the same team. However, the Villainous Vultures only have six members and are one member short (which Jo complains about), so Chris puts in his robot into the villains team. The first challenge is to jump off a 1,000 foot tall cliff into shark infested waters and then find the key that opens the door to the good cabin. Meanwhile, Duncan and Gwen seem to be losing interest in each other, as Duncan is annoyed with Gwen's constant complaining, while Gwen refuses to kiss Duncan. At the cliff, the original contestants jump like it's no problem, since it's the newbies (except Lightning) that are too scared to jump, especially since Fang the shark is back. After they all jump and get the keys, they then have to race back to the cabins on baby strollers with the keys. Both teams jump off the cliff for several times, with the Vultures maintaining an advantage and Jo securing alliances with Lightning and Duncan. Suddenly the robot jumps too and lands onto the water unharmed after being eaten by sharks, but then it explodes due to electrical surges. Alejandro then pops out of the robot suit, scaring and surprising everyone, especially Heather. Alejandro and Jo then race back to the cabin on the baby stroller with the right key. Jo finally unlocks the good cabin with the key and Chris announces that the Villainous Vultures win the challenge. The villains now get to sleep on the good cabin, while the Heroic Hamsters have to sleep in the bad cabin and vote someone off. In the elimination ceremony, Lindsay is voted off by her team and is thrown into a giant toilet called the Flush of Shame.",

        "The episode begins with the Vultures being ashamed by the horrible living conditions of the bad cabins. Heather, Jo and Gwen keep fighting each other while Duncan, Alejandro and Scott say that they never want to lose a challenge ever again. Meanwhile in the McLean Spa Hotel, all of the Heroes Hamsters are very happy that they are being treated like kings in the hotel. Even Courtney thinks that the food in there is perfect. However, at night when Mike sleeps, instead of changing into his different personalities, he now rather sleepwalks as The Malevolent One and goes and breaks Sam's portable gaming device. Sam is the only person to not be in the cabins since he is too busy at Boney Island while being mauled by bears. The next day in the challenge, Chris announces that they will be doing a paintball challenge, but instead of paintballs, it's leeches that are the ammo. Courtney is disgusted by the leeches while Sierra calls all the leaches \"Codies\". Sam later returns with the team and everyone gives him free food that they smuggled in. The challenge then begins and the two teams start an all-out war to shoot at each other with the leeches. Despite the villains getting the good equipment, Alejandro, Scott, and Heather are eliminated instantly. However, Duncan is now ignoring Courtney like how she ignores him, while Sierra begins to imagine that Cameron is Cody. After Duncan, Cameron, Gwen, and Sierra are eliminated back-to-back, only Jo is left for the Vultures, against four heroes. Jo then tracks down Sam, and dodges a leech from Courtney. Courtney is then makes a selfish move by using Sam as a human shield, and Jo almost shoots Courtney, but hears a leech attack from Zoey and dodges it. After Jo's gun jams, Jo throws the ammo holder at Zoey, who catches the leech and defeats Jo, winning the challenge alongside Mike for their team for taking down most of the Vultures with two shots each. That means that the Villainous Vultures now lose for twice in a row and they must vote someone off again. At the elimination ceremony, due to Courtney's selfishness and Duncan taking a hit for Gwen, they switch teams. Cameron then continues to be annoyed that Sierra thinks him as the new Cody, so Cameron then volunteers to go to Boney Island to get rid of Sierra. Jo is then voted off for her bossiness and takes the Flush of Shame.",

Heather is annoyed that Alejandro is losing his feelings for Heather. It then cuts to show Courtney on the balcony. She wonders how Scott is doing on Boney Island. Scott starts sticking things with a stick. A bear pop out of a bush and tries to attack Scott. A claw from Chris' Helicopter picks up Scott and takes him back to the island.

He also explains that that night's moon has a \"special effect\" on the animals. As the winners of the last challenge the vultures get a map with the shortest distance to the other side of the island. The Hamsters get sausage tails and bacon hats as bait for the animals. They walk into the forest. Shortly afterwards the moon takes its effect on the animals. Alejandro then explains that the moon caused the animals to act as their opposite. The moon also activates The Malevolent One, who reveals that he wants to cause havoc among the other campers. On the Villans side Heather starts acting nice which scares everybody. The birds, bunnies, and other animals attack the hamsters due to the bacon hats and sausage tails. The hamsters then follow the vulture into the forest however Mike's evil personality separates them.

Scott cowers across the bridge and safely makes it across. He is bitten by a beaver. Scott shakes the beaver off his arm. The beaver cut the rope. While the Villains try to cross Heather falls and Alejandro grabs her hand. She then reveals that she was faking being affected by the moon and was just trying to be one step ahead of Alejandro. They make it across and Courtney then cuts the other rope so the hamsters can't get across. The hamsters arrive at the cliff. Sierra makes a rope and they swing across the gorge.

        "At the hotel, Gwen helps Cameron fix his broken glasses and the two of them start to form a friendship. Heather sees this and proposes a temporary alliance to Alejandro to avoid getting voted off. Although he accepts, they both reveal in the confessional that they want to lower the other's guard and get them eliminated. Meanwhile for the Hamsters, Duncan realizes that he's starting to become nicer and it freaks him out, Mike's evil personality breaks Duncan's knife the night before, Sierra cries as she misses \"Cam-Cody\", and Zoey finds herself afraid of Mike. Meanwhile, all of the contestants travel to Boney Island where Chris says that they will be in the \"Fun Zone.\" The challenge is to find six mutant eggs for the team baskets. For the Hamsters, Zoey and Mike work together, Duncan becomes more like a nice team player, and Sierra becomes the \"mom\" of a pair of attached mutant rat twins. Meanwhile for the Vultures, Gwen and Cameron stick together, and Courtney and Scott grow closer than before. Heather lies to them to convince them to vote off Alejandro. Later, she stumbles across the McLean-Brand Chris Head and hides it so no one else can find it, not knowing that Alejandro saw everything. When the score is 5-3 for the Vultures, Zoey and Mike hurry back with a nest full of eggs. Heather hurries back with the final egg for the Vultures. She throws it to Cameron, but it hatches and the baby mutant flying goat gives the wedgies to Cameron before flying off. Zoey and Mike place their eggs inside the team basket, earning victory for the Hamsters. When Heather goes back for the invincibility statue, she finds that it is gone and immediately blames Chris. In the confessional, Mike drops a boulder on his head to seal away his evil personality, but the reverse happens and he finds himself trapped inside his own mind. Prior to the elimination ceremony, Gwen finally makes amends with Courtney, and Chris tells Zoey that she will get a prize for the next challenge since she collected the most eggs for her team. Everyone on the Vultures vote Alejandro off, much to Heather's delight. But he stands up, to everyone's surprise, and reveals that it was he who stole the invincibility statue, thus he is safe from elimination. Chris reveals that the only vote that wasn't for Alejandro was for Heather, eliminating her instead. Meanwhile, when Evil Mike whistles his way to Boney Island exile, Duncan suddenly remembers that Mike was in juvie and he was a dangerous inmate known as \"Mal.\" At the Flush of Shame, Alejandro considers the slate between him and Heather clean and they can start over. But Heather pushes him off the toilet and allows herself to be flushed by Chris.",

Although he accepts, they both reveal in the confessional that they want to lower the other's guard and get them eliminated. Meanwhile for the Hamsters, Duncan realizes that he's starting to become nicer and it freaks him out, Mike's evil personality breaks Duncan's knife the night before, Sierra cries as she misses \"Cam-Cody\", and Zoey finds herself afraid of Mike. Meanwhile, all of the contestants travel to Boney Island where Chris says that they will be in the \"Fun Zone.\" The challenge is to find six mutant eggs for the team baskets. For the Hamsters, Zoey and Mike work together, Duncan becomes more like a nice team player, and Sierra becomes the \"mom\" of a pair of attached mutant rat twins. Meanwhile for the Vultures, Gwen and Cameron stick together, and Courtney and Scott grow closer than before. Heather lies to them to convince them to vote off Alejandro. Later, she stumbles across the McLean-Brand Chris Head and hides it so no one else can find it, not knowing that Alejandro saw everything. When the score is 5-3 for the Vultures, Zoey and Mike hurry back with a nest full of eggs. Heather hurries back with the final egg for the Vultures. She throws it to Cameron, but it hatches and the baby mutant flying goat gives the wedgies to Cameron before flying off. Zoey and Mike place their eggs inside the team basket, earning victory for the Hamsters. When Heather goes back for the invincibility statue, she finds that it is gone and immediately blames Chris. In the confessional, Mike drops a boulder on his head to seal away his evil personality, but the reverse happens and he finds himself trapped inside his own mind. Prior to the elimination ceremony, Gwen finally makes amends with Courtney, and Chris tells Zoey that she will get a prize for the next challenge since she collected the most eggs for her team. Everyone on the Vultures vote Alejandro off, much to Heather's delight. But he stands up, to everyone's surprise, and reveals that it was he who stole the invincibility statue, thus he is safe from elimination. Chris reveals that the only vote that wasn't for Alejandro was for Heather, eliminating her instead. Meanwhile, when Evil Mike whistles his way to Boney Island exile, Duncan suddenly remembers that Mike was in juvie and he was a dangerous inmate known as \"Mal.\" At the Flush of Shame, Alejandro considers the slate between him and Heather clean and they can start over. But Heather pushes him off the toilet and allows herself to be flushed by Chris.",

        "With the merge being announced at the start of the episode, each contestant fights for their individual right to remain in the competition. Chris explains the challenge, which is a boat race around the island. There were a veriety of boats to choose from, and it was first come, first serve. Alehandro took an early lead with a speedboat with a tag-team of Courtney and Gwen not far behind. Mal shows up and sabotages the majority of the remaining boats, and taking one for himself. The remaining four are forced to team up with nothing but two poles, a rope, and a raft. After everyone chooses a boat, we come to Mike, who is still chained to the rock inside his mind. He notices a tower-like structure in the distance, and magaes to free himself from his imprisonment. After some walking, he comes across Chester, who joins Mike in his journey to the tower. Then, we come back to the race. Naturally, the raft ends up far behind everyone else, but Cameron's quick thinking let to Scott being used as bait for Fang to propel the raft after getting snagged on the rope. Chef later attacked the campers with dynamite, destroying Gwen and Courtney's motor. Duncan had caught a stick and kept it for himself after putting out the fuse. Immediately after, Chris' \"cottage\" comes into view, and Duncan, still set on proving he's no softy, sets out to destroy it. After, much stalling, Gwen and Courtney finally get their motor running again, and are back in the race. As Zoe, Cameron, and Scott are catching up to Mal, Zoe and Cameron debate how they can determine that Mike is in control. After realizing the one way, Zoe jumps off the raft and lets herself into danger with the piranhas surrounding her, and with only a pole between them. Mike regains control briefly after hearing Zoe scream, but it almost immediately replaced with Mal again, who saves her to avoid suspicions. Finally, the race comes to the final stretch, and Alehandro, who had been sitting in front of the finishing line because of his stalling motor, wins by a nose, quite literally. After the campers all regroup, Chris ponders where Duncan is only to hear an explosion and look at the rubble that was once his \"cottage\". After plentiful sulking from Chris, the voting ceremony begins, and Chris says he has a surprise for \"Boom Boom\". The police show up, and Duncan is arrested and notified that this time, he's going to a \"Big Boy jail\". The voting finally commences, and Cameron is chosen for the Flush O' Shame. However, he stays because Duncan had already been booted off only moments beforehand. The episode ends with Cameron explaining how the thinks the votes were tampered with, and it's immediately revealed that Mal HAD tampered with them.",
