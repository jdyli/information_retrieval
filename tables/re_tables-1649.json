Louise tells Wesley that Gaz is Corinthian's biological father; Wesley proceeds to threaten Gaz before realising the truth will only hurt everyone. Tim helps Janet and Donna to realise that Gaz doesn't deserve either of them, and Janet kicks Gaz out of the house. Gaz tells Janet that Corinthian is his son, but she misunderstands his true meaning. Meanwhile, Louise worries that Scott will abandon her for a groupie while on tour. She decides to send him a picture message, but cannot decide which pose to use until Gaz sends an explicit photo for her ,which he calls the \"standing muff shot\" and says that everyone loves it. Initially terrified of Scott's response, she is thrilled when he replies with a message which says \"I Think I Love You\". Having alienated all of his friends, Gaz finally realises who he wants to be with. He races to find her, even taking a car to make it in time, but a crash leads to the car exploding. A week later, he wakes up to find Donna at his bedside. She has been doting on him the whole time he has been unconscious, and promises that they can work through their difficulties and be happy together.
