Upon the Orbitron's removal, the cement pad underneath it supported the \"UFO Maze\". This maze stood for a number of years before it was removed due to the construction of the Galaxy Orbiter. The pad currently supports a \"finale\" section of the Galaxy Orbiter.

Original concept called for several units which would have \"battles\" between them with shooting and lasers, but only one was ever purchased, and modified to bounce riders.

Every boat was affixed to a square nylon cord which was pulled through the bottom of the lake on a submerged track structure. Never a popular ride due to the lack of theming and scenery on the lake, the ride was constantly breaking due to the high friction force on the nylon cord which caused it to snap often, stranding riders. Lake also did not have a filtration system and resulted in algae blooms and constant draining and cleaning.

Ride would have operated on two levels, on a spiral oval track, and went into its own basement, before re-emerging on the main floor. Basement was hastily converted to a warehouse for games inventory, and today the only sign of its existence is a change in concrete floor texture over the basement, near the office."

        "While doing a story on a rare coin collection, the coins are stolen in a robbery with one of the thieves wearing a wig and muffling his voice to appear to be the coin collector's bitter ex-wife. The photo that Parker has of the disguised thief will falsely frame the ex-wife and Parker is willing to go to jail in order to protect the innocent and break out of jail as Spider-Man to bring the thieves to justice. This episode has been released on VHS as \"Photo Finish & A Matter of State\" by Rhino Home Video. This version included a new scene featuring Nicholas Hammond and Chip Fields that served to connect the two stories. Photo Finish was previously released by itself (in its original one-hour format) on a LP-speed cassette from low-budget label Star Maker Home Video. Both versions are out of print."

        "The story moves to the time Ban and Ginji became the Second Generation's GetBackers and are requested by a drug dealer called Fox to take a man out of the prison. The two infiltrate into the prison thanks to a girl's help but are attacked Takuma Fudou who was hired to stop the GetBackers. As Ginji fights him, Ban manages to use his Evil Eye on Fudou and escapes with Ginji. The two then find the man they are supposed to retrieve but he reveals he has no desire to return. He explains how he was a gangster and lover of Yoko who was nearly killed by the mafia and lost his memory. The man started a family and went to prison when remembering his crimes. The GetBackers tell Fox the man's answer and Ban uses his Evil Eye to show her a meeting with him. The GetBackers later meet Hevn who introduces a client who wants to retrieve a dog.

Ban, Ginji, Paul and Maria go to face them after leaving Hevn in Masaki's hands. Kagami forces Himiko to merge with her other half causing her death as he takes another her soul in the form of a key needed to open the door to Babylon City. This causes Kagenuma to be controlled by his other half, the Voodoo King. The Voodoo King defeats Teshimine and takes Shido's key. The GetBackers reach Kagami who Ban fights to avenge Himiko and let Ginji continue his way. Ban defeats Kagami who tries to escape but is killed by Akabane, now hired by Brain Trust's Professor Makube. Der Kaiser's key then replaces Himiko's key causing her revival. Ginji becomes the Lightning Lord to fight the Voodoo King and the one-on-one ends with the disappearance of the two alter-egos. Although the fight against Brain Trust ended, Ginji is forced to fight against Ban to gain the right to enter Babylon City.",

After Ginji leaves Ban challenges Akabane to a final one-on-one as he wants to end their rivalry before he vanishes as a resut of overusing the Evil Eye. During the fight, Ban forces Akabane to show his true powers and the fight ends when both Ban and Akabane reach their limits. Ginji then arrives to Babylon City which is an alternate Shinjuku without the Infinity Fortress. He meets his mother, Dr. Amano, who explains how she worked for Brain Trust to create a parallel world where her late child would be live but renegade members including Kagami tried to take advantage of the world. Having entered Babylon City, Ginji has the right to change his world but he refuses to do it and says farewell to his mother. Ginji then returns to his world he reunites with his friends including Ban who was saved by Akabane. Shortly after returning to Paul's cafe, the GetBackers get a job in which they have to retrieve Ban's mother.",
