When the letters add up to spell A-L-E-R-M-O, the solution appears. Palermo realizes the attacks are personal. Chris and T.C. discover she's pregnant. T.C. proposes marriage, but Chris refuses to \"get married at the end of a shotgun.\" Each fantasizes about impending parenthood, but just as they're settling into the idea, they learn that Chris is not pregnant after all. Palermo hosts the daughter of his high school sweetheart, a young aspiring actress. A night of dinner and wine lead to lovemaking... and serious morning-after regrets from Palermo, who is already suffering from a mid-life crisis. This and the Letterhead Beatings make him question his current path in life. At the end of the episode, he takes a two-month leave of absence to go to Italy and deal with his mid-life crisis. Cory is devastated when her boyfriend Tim Stone suddenly elopes with his ex-girlfriend. She hooks up with Doug Fraser, a nice guy she punches out in a bar, and sleeps with him on the first date. Realizing her behavior is totally out of character, Cory assumes the relationship is doomed to failure, but her chemistry with Doug is too strong to ignore -- as much as she tries to.

Operating out of a beach bar decorated with Nazi symbols, the leader of this gang went to law school and is well vested in his rights. T.C. and Victor, who is Hispanic but doesn't look it, are both goaded into a confrontation that results in T.C.'s suspension. Cory and Victor chase and arrest an irrepressible sixteen-year-old black \"tagger\" who hits everything from tunnels to buildings to Victor's bicycle seat and the side of the firehouse.

Operating out of a beach bar decorated with Nazi symbols, the leader of this gang went to law school and is well vested in his rights. T.C. and Victor, who is Hispanic but doesn't look it, are both goaded into a confrontation that results in T.C.'s suspension. Cory and Victor chase and arrest an irrepressible sixteen-year-old black \"tagger\" who hits everything from tunnels to buildings to Victor's bicycle seat and the side of the firehouse. After seeing his home and works of art, Cory realizes the tagger is truly talented and acting out using his painting skills. Unfortunately, after an encounter in the firehouse cell with the leader of the Surf Nazis, the tagger becomes a target for their terror and must ultimately be saved by our officers. \"The Cove\" has long been an illegal nude beach, but Election Day is fast approaching and a ballot measure may make it legal. Our officers are placed in the ironic position of arresting nude protesters one-week, then having to defend their rights after the ballot measure passes. Mayor Mickey Dolenz appears in the episode, unable to take a position on the matter."

        "An anti-technology terrorist is setting bombs around the beach, and will only let T.C. and Victor dismantle them. He wants all power in Santa Monica shut down for twelve hours on the first of the month. An FBI agent comes in to assist the unit, butting heads with Palermo by making Chris his liaison. In the end, it's the Bike Patrol -- and not the FBI -- that discovers the bomber's true plan is to use the blackout to pull a multi-million dollar bank heist. While this is happening, T.C.'s girlfriend Sandy returns to live with him, with the condition that he not tell her anything about his job so she won't worry. But the agreement ends up making things harder on both of them.",

Saeko is silently abducted from the school library, and Ran is surprised that she still cannot hear Rui's thoughts.

After Ran retorts that Rui still likes her even with her telepathic powers, Midori is taken aback and flees.
