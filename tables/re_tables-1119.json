        "In the year 2077, eight dangerous rebels from the group Liber8, facing execution for an act of terrorism that killed thousands of innocents, manage to avoid execution by escaping into a time jump, transporting themselves from 2077 to 2012. In doing so, however, they also transport Protector Kiera Cameron, a law enforcement officer who tries to intervene and is sucked into the jump too. Soon after her arrival, she gets into contact with, and befriends, young Alec Sadler, the 17-year old who will one day grow up to create the technology that her world is built upon, and who will control future society. One of the terrorists, Lucas Ingram, is arrested soon after their arrival, but the remainder arm themselves and hope to blend into society while carrying out their agenda: to start a war. They begin stealing arms and robbing banks and Kiera, who has lost everything she has, finds herself on a new mission: to hunt down the insurgents. She takes on a new identity and manages to infiltrate and join the Vancouver Police Department, posing as a Portland police officer, and works with local Vancouver officer Carlos Fonnegra to track down the terrorists and stop their reign of violence - beginning with an attack on the local police station that frees Ingram.",

It's apparent that the weapon used to kill him is quite advanced and Kiera believes that it could be the work of Liber8. His graduate student, Shane Mathers offers to help them but finds that all of the professor's files were stolen. They suspect Dr. Melissa Dobeck, a former partner who split with Ames after a disagreement over ownership of the intellectual property, but she denies having anything to do with it. They hit a brick wall when the military takes over their case on national security grounds. Meanwhile Liber8's leader, Kagame, suddenly arrives in the present. He's taken to hospital but quickly sets out to find others in his group. No one knows why he didn't arrive at the same time as the others and for that matter if anyone else from the future may also be here.

He extends a helping hand to Maddie, paying off the mortgage on her house. She thinks he may be coming on to her but he assures her that's not the case - in fact, Maddie is his grandmother, though he doesn't tell her that.

        "Kagame pursues step one of his new agenda - win the intellectuals and the grass roots dissenters. The Liber8 freedom fighters actively support and encourage violent protests, using present-day anarchists to riot outside the company headquarters of a major corporation, Exotrol. During the protest, the CEO of Exotrol, Henrietta Sherman, is kidnapped by Liber8. Kiera suspects Liber8 was behind the violence at the protest, to provide cover for the kidnapping. A video of Sherman is soon on the Internet and her kidnappers demands, for $20 million in cash, is revealed. Kagame decides to put the decision to kill or free her to an Internet vote - confirming to Kiera that Liber8 have changed their tactics and are trying to get the public on their side by getting them to vote whether she lives or dies and to expose the truth.

        "A high-stakes Port of Vancouver Union Election gives Kiera her first taste of contemporary political intrigue. First, the issue of Kiera's trust and loyalty of her partner come into question as evidence points to Carlos in the death of an investigative reporter: Carlos finds himself investigating the murder of journalist Alicia Fuentes, who he slept with the night before her death. He had received a call from Carlos's lifelong old friend, Jim Martin, who is running as the leading candidate in the polls for election as the head of the local dock workers union, on a platform of cleaning up the union's corrupt practices. Martin was having an argument with Alicia, who was about to blow the lid off a dirty secret Martin may have been hiding. Carlos knew Alicia, picked her up and after dinner spent most of the night at her apartment. When they find her dead the next morning, he tells no one, not even Kiera, that he was there until about 1:30. Meanwhile, Alec is trying to fix Kiera's suit, and with some of its capability restored, she gets a lead on the killer, and also finds that the piece of the time travel device is missing, and knows Kellog has to be the one who took it. While covertly and desperately trying to clear both men and find out who killed Alicia, Kiera will learn first-hand the lengths one will go to get elected - and the allies they associate with once victory is achieved.",

The only tie between the two is a local computer gaming company, where both were software testers, that's been doing more than just developing video games; it's developing an immersive holographic program and Kiera decides to try it out. The effects on her are devastating - Kiera's HUD system short circuits and her internal electronics go haywire. Kagame and Liber8 attempts to take control of her, while she is in this bad state. Alec works frantically to reboot her processors and manages to save Kiera from killing her partner.

        "Following the events of the Season One finale, Kiera decides to work on the edge of the law, getting support and resources from her friends at Vancouver P.D., while keeping their hands clean of her tactics. Alec is at odds over the death of his step father, arrest of his step brother, and the message from his future self. He moves in with some buddies, gets a job at a Memory Express hi-tech store, and refuses to answer Kiera's calls. When Vancouver's mayor is assassinated, Kiera works on the case with her former police department partner, Carlos Fonnegra, with CSIS Agent Gardiner dogging her for answers about her forcefield and invisibility. Kiera eventually gets Alec to call her and help out, also returning to the police when Carlos points out that her recent capture of a gang member may be jeopardized when the case goes to court due to her unaffiliated status. Gardiner catches up with Kiera when she is investigating the apartment from which the assassin fired the shots and demands answers with a gun. Kiera tells him that she is a time traveler from 2077, but before the conversation can go further, Fonnegra shows up with backup. Kiera tells Alec she will confront and destroy Liber8, and its growing band of 2013 followers, to preserve the future. Alec is uncertain, asking if they should trust the message from his future self (Kiera says it is 50/50). A flash forward finally reveals the message that Alec and Kiera have seen - Alec 2077 is proud of the tech-smart legacy that \"their\" father taught them, he regrets his part in helping the corporate-dominated future unfold, and young Alec is the only chance to stop it. Unknown to Kiera and Alec 2013, Alec 2077 had loaded data directly into Kiera 2077's brain chips (CMR).",

        "Travis survived his shooting by Sonja at the end of Season 1 and was jailed in the same prison as Julian. A group of skinheads try to intimidate Julian and Travis defends him. As a result, he is to be transferred to a different location. This is a part of a plan by Sonja to kill him. The Vancouver PD is worried about an attempt to free Travis during the transfer, so a decoy convoy is sent out, with Keira and Fonegra traveling with Travis in the real paddy-wagon. Both the decoy and the real prisoner transfer vehicle are attacked, by remotely detonated bomb and remotely controlled machine gun in the case of the decoy. While Keira is trying to drive the wagon after the driver is shot by a pursuing vehicle, Travis breaks free of his restraints and fights with Fonegra in the back. After shaking off an attack by men in a car, they are chased by a helicopter and take refuge in a road tunnel. The helicopter lands in front of them and the car approaches from behind. The men in the helicopter fire a rocket-propelled grenade at the car, killing its occupants and then proceed to attack Keira and Carlos with automatic rifles. After running out of ammunition, Keira uses her suit to provide a force-field to protect her and Carlos as they flee. Travis is freed and Garza turns out to be part of the helicopter team. Meanwhile, Kellogg approaches Alec with a proposed partnership, which Alec at first refuses because he is worried that it would lead to helping create the future that his future self asked him to avoid. In the end, he reconsiders after being told by a customer to clean up the customer's child's spilled slushie. Gardiner thinks Keira is the mole feeding Liber8 information from the police department and confronts her. Keira suggests to Carlos that Gardiner might be the mole.",
