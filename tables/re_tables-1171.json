Unwilling to let this happen, Sakura brings her Star Wand and despite Kero's misgivings, recklessly converts several cards at once although she's left weakened. However, she loses control of one of the cards, the Dash, which panics and flees, possessing Toya's bike which Eriol had enchanted earlier while helping Sakura clean her yard.

Syaoran, in the meantime, has fully realized his strong romantic feelings for Sakura and consults with Tomoyo, who helps him deal with his jealousy towards Eriol and gives him the confidence (just barely, though) to speak his mind to the oblivious Sakura. Before he can do so, however, both he and Sakura sense Clow Reed's presence once again, this time in the form of a basketball that leads them through the school at night. Space has been warped in the building, causing every door to lead into a different room each time, which separates her from Tomoyo. She begins to lose hope of finding her, but Syaoran gives her the courage to proceed. Sakura then hears Tomoyo's singing voice and uses the transformed Shadow card to track her down. She later thanks Syaoran for all the help he has ever given her; Syaoran tries to confess his love to her, but is interrupted when Kero forces Sakura to pose with him for Tomoyo's camera."

        "After viewing Nakuru's film, Sakura tours the high school fair with her friends, while Toya comforts Yukito when he appears troubled by the fact that he is not human. Alone with Yukito in one of the attractions, Sakura tells Yukito how much she likes him. However, Yukito gently rebuffs her, saying that her love for him is merely fatherly, quite similar to her deep feelings she has for her father, and that he already has someone he really likes and cares for a lot. Sakura, in a rare moment of insight, realizes that person to be her older brother, Toya. Yukito tells Sakura that the person she really likes most is still out there when Sakura senses Clow Reed's presence once more. Using the Maze and Illusion cards, Sakura manages to trap the presence and discovers it to be coming from Eriol, though she loses consciousness. Eriol jumbles her memory of the discovery, acknowledging that she has indeed grown strong to find him. Sakura tells Syaoran of her experience with Yukito and, despite her understanding and acceptance of the matter, begins to cry. Knowing that now is not the time to tell her that he really loves her, Syaoran comforts her and assures her that she will find the person who she really likes and cares about the most.",

        "Amy tells Sheldon that she will be working on an experiment at Caltech near him and asks Sheldon how he feels about that. Sheldon has no problem with it, until Howard explains that he would not want to work with Bernadette and have to spend both day and night with her. Sheldon withdraws his approval, though Amy tells him that she is still going to take the job. The next day, Amy is even madder at Sheldon when he embarrasses her at lunch in front of her colleagues.

When Meiling enters the room, it's clear that her presence has exhausted him and he is desperate to escape it. Mr. Terada explains that she is from Hong Kong and cousin to Syaoran. Meiling is quick to add that she is actually his fiancee, and obviously believes Sakura wants to take Syaoran away from her. Syaoran asks Meiling why she came, and she answers that she was lonely for him. He explains that he's not going back until he gets the Clow Cards, but she doesn't particularly care about that. She reminds him that a fortune-teller in Hong Kong predicted someone else would get them, a reminder that clearly grates on his nerves. It's only after he makes it clear he won't return home without the Cards that Meiling decides she will get involved and 'help', so that he can collect them faster. Meiling is just as competitive as Syaoran, and indirectly challenges Sakura to a gymnastics competition. It begins a long trend of Meiling forever trying to one-up Sakura at a number of things, though she rarely succeeds. Sakura, however, isn't interested in competing at all. Meiling meets Sakura and the others at the park, revealing that she knows all about the Clow Cards and intends to participate in the captures. Meiling displays impressive martial artist technique against the Fight Card, demonstrating what skills have been taught to the children of the Li family. Syaoran shows up later, revealing that Meiling went after the Card without his knowledge. We learn Meiling has no magic of her own. Syaoran comes across as extremely protective of Meiling's safety, probably because she is without magic. He also comes across as condescending.",

When Toya and Yukito come home, Tomoyo hides Kero while Sakura confronts the Little card, but it runs away from her. Eventually, Sakura chases the card into the kitchen, where it almost shrinks Toya, but it bounces away. The card bounces up the stairs, and Sakura gives up because it was not possible to continue.

Everyone assumes it is just one of his usual lies, but Sakura and her friends come across a blue mailbox after school. Meilin recalls Yamazaki opening his eyes while telling the story, and this is confirmed after a look at the video tape Tomoyo was recording of Sakura at the time. Meilin realizes that Yamazaki must only tell the truth when he opens his eyes. They rush outside when they hear Yamazaki and Chiharu coming, and watch as, while his eyes are open, Yamazaki says that if someone mails a letter towards someone he or she loves in the blue mailbox, that person will love them too.

Meilin decides not to go, but Sakura drags her along and tells her there are things only she can do. Meanwhile, Syaoran is getting beaten by the Twin card. After a couple of failed attempts, Sakura thinks that Meilin and Syaoran can work together to keep the two bodies of the Twin card immobilized, so she can seal them away; they try it, and it works. Sakura seals the Twin card, and it goes to Syaoran because he and Meilin weakened it. Syaoran tells Meilin that he never thought that she was in his way. Sakura, Tomoyo, and Kero go to the airport with Syaoran to say goodbye to Wei and Meilin. Meilin asks Syaoran if he remembers the promise, which is until Syaoran finds a girl he likes more than her, she will be his bride. Meilin whispers a thank you to Sakura for saving them with her magic, before she leaves.",

She wakes up early to see Yukito compete in an archery competition. Sakura explains what she knows of her dream to Kero before running down to make breakfast. She meets up with Syaoran and Tomoyo at the archery competition, and Kero tags along too. At the archery tournament, Sakura finds that Ms. Mizuki is one of the challengers and ends up in the finals alongside Yukito. During the fierce match, Kero pokes his head out of Sakura's bag upon sensing tremendous magical power, shooting a piercing glare at Ms. Mizuki. Sensing his gaze, Ms. Mizuki loses her focus and the tournament. Later during lunch, Sakura discovers that Kero is missing from her bag. Searching for him, she is astonished to find him in the middle of a private conversation with Ms. Mizuki. While walking home, they run into Toya once again, this time dressed in a bear costume giving out balloons. After he leaves, there is an earthquake, likely caused by the final Clow Card.",

        "The Million Dollar Quartet session took place on December 4, 1956 at Sun Studios in Memphis, Tennessee. The session was performed by Elvis Presley, Johnny Cash, Jerry Lee Lewis and Carl Perkins. This was first released on bootleg in 1981 with only 17 tracks. It was released more times over the years until 1990, when RCA released the copy of the tape owned by Elvis. In 2006, more of the session was released. The New Year's Eve concert from 1976 was one of Elvis' longest shows. This release was an audience recording in 1977 as the name of Rockin' With Elvis On New Year's Eve. It was a two LP set and is considered as one of the best audience recordings. In 2003 exactly the same source tape was used for the FTD/RCA release of New Year's Eve. The Funny Side of Elvis and The King Goes Bananas are audience recordings from September 3, 1973 Closing Show in Vegas that was released in the 90s. One of Elvis' most unusual concerts in his career with Elvis clowning around on most of the songs. Most of the soundboard of this show was released in 2004 by FTD/RCA under the name Closing Night. During the movie Elvis On Tour, Elvis did a show on April 18, 1972 in San Antonio, Texas. Three songs are seen in the movie. This was released as a soundboard in 1993 under the name Welcome to San Antonio under the Vicky label but RCA released the stereo source tape of this show on Disc 4 in the box set Close Up in 2003. The show from May 13, 1973 in Lake Tahoe was released sometime in the 90s as an audience recording but in 2003 the soundboard of the show was released under the FTD/RCA label as Takin' Tahoe Night. FTD released Southern Nights with many songs from various bootlegs that came from April, May and June 1975. The songs are from Atlanta, Macon, Memphis, Houston, Lake Charles, Huntsville and Mobile. FTD released Unchained Melody has songs from some bootlegs as well. One that stands out the most is Where No One Stands Alone. This was the only time he sang that song."
