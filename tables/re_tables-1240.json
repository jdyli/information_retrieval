        "Just by the village of Confrecourt is the memorial known as \"La croix bris\u00e9e\" or \u201cbroken cross.\u201d It was commissioned and erected by the owner of the farm at Confrecourt in 1929 and bears his family crest. It was intended to symbolise the suffering of all Frenchmen who fought on the Confrecourt plateau in the 1914\u20131918 war and includes the words \"La croix est tomb\u00e9e, le Christ est vivant\". An information board by the memorial informs us that on 13 September 1914, after the victory on the Marne, the French Army crossed the Aisne and mounted an attack on the Soissonnais plateau but only after 10 days of intense and vicious fighting did they reach Confrecourt. Neither the French nor the Germans were able to secure a breakthrough and began to dig in. The war of the trenches was just beginning at this time and the farm and the many quarries and limestone caves in the area were to serve as living quarters for the French troops. The area saw frequent action in the following years and it was in June 1918 that a heroic defence of the plateau by the French was one of the actions which halted the German Offensive (the so-called \u201cSpring Offensive\u201d). On 20 August 1918, the area was finally liberated."

It was erected following the efforts of a group of ex-infantrymen, and inaugurated on 2 July 1922 in the presence of both Marshal Foch and P\u00e9tain and Generals Mangin and Weygand, as well as General Estienne, the so-called \u201cfather of the tank\u201d. The monument is situated at Chol\u00e9ra Farm from where a mass attack of French tanks was thrown in the direction of Juvincourt on 16 April 1917. A plaque to the rear of the memorial recalls that on 16 April 1917, the 151st Infantry Regiment continued to advance with the assistance of Bossut\u2019s tanks right up to B\u00e9liers Wood. There are some tanks dating back to the 1950s on display near the memorial."

        "This cemetery sits on the western outskirts of Soupir village on the D 925 between Vailly-sur-Aisne and Bourg-et-Comin. This area is known as Mont Sapin and was the subject of fierce fighting throughout the war. The 2nd Italian Army Corps arrived in France on 25 April 1918, as a sign of mutual aid from the Italian Government. Under the command of General Albricci, the Corps consisted of the 3rd and 8th Italian Divisions. They were initially positioned alongside French Divisions near Verdun in order to acclimatise themselves to conditions on the Western Front. Four months later on 15 July 1918 the Germans attacked when the 2nd Battle of the Marne opened. The Germans struck either side of Reims, in what was to be their last offensive of the war. The attack on the eastern side of Reims against General Gouraud's First Army came to a grinding halt on its first day. The western prong against Degoutte's Sixth Army made better progress and established some semblance of a breakthrough. Reinforcements from the French Ninth Army plus British, American and the two Italian Divisions were all used to shore up the front. The German offensive was brought to a halt and then pushed back. On 20 July 1918 the Germans ordered a retreat and by 3 August 1918 they were back on their starting lines. Following their participation in this success, the 2nd Italian Corps was positioned on the river Aisne just south of Soupir below the Chemin des Dames on 22 September 1918. On 1 October they took Soupir and spent the remainder of the month fighting along the Chemin des Dames as the Germans were slowly pushed north. During the course of the war the 2nd Italian Corps lost 4,375 killed and 10,000 wounded. The cemetery at Soupir contains the bodies of 593 Italian soldiers, the majority of whom fell in fighting along the Chemin des Dames. From April to November 1918 the 2nd Italian Army Corps, made up of the 3rd and 8th Divisions (The Brescia and Alpi Infantry Brigades) fought in the Reims sector between Vrigny and Jaulgonne, in the Ardennes sector and in the Aisne to the east of Soissons fighting under the 5th, 10th and the 3rd French Armies. The Italian forces commanded by General Alberico Albricci suffered more than 9,000 soldiers killed during its victorious campaigns. 592 of them rest in this Military Cemetery created and maintained by the Italian Ministry of Defence. The entrance to the cemetery at Soupir in shown here."

        "This cemetery sits on the western outskirts of Soupir village on the D 925 between Vailly-sur-Aisne and Bourg-et-Comin. This area is known as Mont Sapin and was the subject of fierce fighting throughout the war. The 2nd Italian Army Corps arrived in France on 25 April 1918, as a sign of mutual aid from the Italian Government. Under the command of General Albricci, the Corps consisted of the 3rd and 8th Italian Divisions. They were initially positioned alongside French Divisions near Verdun in order to acclimatise themselves to conditions on the Western Front. Four months later on 15 July 1918 the Germans attacked when the 2nd Battle of the Marne opened. The Germans struck either side of Reims, in what was to be their last offensive of the war. The attack on the eastern side of Reims against General Gouraud's First Army came to a grinding halt on its first day. The western prong against Degoutte's Sixth Army made better progress and established some semblance of a breakthrough. Reinforcements from the French Ninth Army plus British, American and the two Italian Divisions were all used to shore up the front. The German offensive was brought to a halt and then pushed back. On 20 July 1918 the Germans ordered a retreat and by 3 August 1918 they were back on their starting lines. Following their participation in this success, the 2nd Italian Corps was positioned on the river Aisne just south of Soupir below the Chemin des Dames on 22 September 1918. On 1 October they took Soupir and spent the remainder of the month fighting along the Chemin des Dames as the Germans were slowly pushed north. During the course of the war the 2nd Italian Corps lost 4,375 killed and 10,000 wounded. The cemetery at Soupir contains the bodies of 593 Italian soldiers, the majority of whom fell in fighting along the Chemin des Dames. From April to November 1918 the 2nd Italian Army Corps, made up of the 3rd and 8th Divisions (The Brescia and Alpi Infantry Brigades) fought in the Reims sector between Vrigny and Jaulgonne, in the Ardennes sector and in the Aisne to the east of Soissons fighting under the 5th, 10th and the 3rd French Armies. The Italian forces commanded by General Alberico Albricci suffered more than 9,000 soldiers killed during its victorious campaigns. 592 of them rest in this Military Cemetery created and maintained by the Italian Ministry of Defence. The entrance to the cemetery at Soupir in shown here."

The sculptor was Antoine Sartorio who had served with the 363rd himself. The monument lists the 363rd's battle honours- Vosges/Somme/Aisne/Alsace/Argonne and Champagne. The monument to the 24th, 28th and 133rd was inaugurated on 14 October 1923. Sadly this monument has deteriorated over the years and a number of the inscriptions are now no longer legible."

        "Early in the war and before Italy's entry into the conflict, many Italians living in France joined the French army as volunteers and on 5 November 1914, part of the Foreign Legion took the name \" R\u00e9giment des Garibaldian\" in memory of Garibaldi who had fought alongside the French in 1870. Six of Garibaldi's grandsons had served with this unit which was dissolved in 1915 when Italy officially joined the war. Many of the volunteers then joined Italian units fighting against the Austro-Hungarian armies. Two of Garbaldi's grandsons, Bruno et Constante, were killed fighting in the Argonne. In 1918 the Italians sent 41,000 soldiers to fight in Champagne and the Chemin des Dames. From April to November 1918 the Italians,led by Alberico Albricci, lost more than 9,000 men. Many were buried in the Bligny cemetery or moved there from other areas. Opposite the Bligny cemetery a \"Roman Way\" has been established, lined with cypress trees and leading to a symbolic broken column."

The obelisk is surmounted by an American eagle whose wings protectively envelope the 1st Division\u2019s crest. A bronze plaque recounts how the 1st Division advanced 11 kilometres into the German lines taking the village of Berzy-le-Sec and arriving just in front of Buzancy. In fact at the site of the memorial the Division lost 2,213 men killed and 6,347 men wounded in the four days of fighting from 18 to 21 July 1918, before being relieved by the 15th (Scottish) Division on 22 July. The memorial to the Scots can be found in the nearby Buzancy Military Cemetery."

        "The area of the Chemin des Dames between Cerny and the Ferme d'Hurtebise was the sector attacked on 16 April 1917 by the 2nd Colonial Corps of General Mangin's 6th Army as part of Nivelle's offensive. The Ferme d'Hurtebise was a known strong point but Nivelle decided that it would be there in the centre of his battle plan that he would place the dividing line between the 6th and the 5th Armies. Military strategists would say that this was a strange choice. The seam of a garment is not perhaps its strongest point. The 2nd Colonial Corps were under instructions to advance at 05:45 hours and take the farm. They would then take the plateau in front of them, the Vauclerc Wood, the valley of the Ailette, the valley of the Bi\u00e8vres beyond that and then the hill in front of them so that they would at that stage be able to see the town of Laon right in front of them. They had been given just seven hours of fighting to advance over many kilometres of terrain and two valleys. Mangin had insisted that the troops would advance 100 metres every three minutes which was a minute faster than Haig's calculations up at Arras where the British were attacking hopefully to divert the German's attention from the Nivelle attack. The Senegalese soldiers who were part of the 2nd Colonial Corps were already suffering from the cold and although they went forward with great spirit and the first German positions were taken with ease, gaining many prisoners, this could not be sustained as there were German machine gun posts everywhere - even behind them. What the planners do not appear to have taken into account was the depth of the \"creutes\" (called \"boves\" in Arras), the underground chalk quarries that riddled the ridge and were used by the Germans to great advantage. Three of the four 2nd Corps colonels were killed and as the second and third waves of troops advanced, in accordance with Mangin's strict timetable, they became an easier target for the German gunners. The 15th Colonial Division on the left were charged with taking Cerny but like the 10th on their right they could only get as far as the road and a little beyond. In this area is a memorial which is in memory of 2nd Lieutenant Louis Astoul of the 70\u00e8me S\u00e9n\u00e9galais who fell on the field of honour at the age of 24 during the course of the assault on 16 April 1917. This is a private memorial erected by Astoul's parents. He had been reported missing near the village of Paissy before even reaching the ridge. Whenever there are ceremonies at Cerny the Guard of Honour is often the 1er R\u00e9giment d'Artillerie de Marine - The 1st Marine Artillery Regiment. The Marines had been created to guard France's colonial interests in 1622 by Cardinal Richelieu and as overseas troops they would fight in the African Army (The 19th Corps during the war). Known as the 1st Colonial Artillery Regiment, the \"Bigors\" as their gunners were called fought with intense bravery winning their 9th Battle Honour at the Somme in 1916. Although disbanded in 1940 following the armistice, the soldiers rallied to de Gaulle in 1941 and fought in Africa gaining an 11th Battle Honour at El-Alamein in 1942."

        "In March 1915 four corporals of the 21st Company of the 336th Regiment of Infantry, Louis Girard, Lucien Lechat, Louis Lefoulon et Th\u00e9ophile Maupas were tried for mutiny and shot. In his last letter to his wife, Maupas wrote \"Je n'ai rien \u00e0 me reprocher, je n'ai ni vol\u00e9, ni tu\u00e9, je n'ai sali ni la r\u00e9putation ni l'honneur de personne. Je puis marcher la t\u00eate haute\". The four soldiers had been selected randomly to be made examples of, when there had been a general refusal to obey an order to leave the trenches and attack the enemy. For many years Maupas' wife Blanche Maupas and others fought to have the men pardonned and in 1923 Blanche succeeded in having her husband's remains taken from its grave in Suippes and moved to the communal cemetery of Sartilly in La Manche and in 1925 a monument was erected over Maupas' grave at Sartilly commemorating the four corporals of Souhain. Paul Moreau-Vauthier carried out the sculptural work on the monument. Finally in 1934 the four corporals were given a formal pardon by a special tribunal which came to the conclusion that the order given to the 21st Company of the 336th Infantry Regiment on the evening of 10 March was \"irrealisable\" (unreasonable) The affair of the four corporals was considered most controversial in France and although Stanley Kubrick made the film \"Paths of Glory\" based on the events at Souhain in 1957, the film was banned in France until 1975 and was not shown on TV until 1982. In 1962 Blanche Maupas died and was buried alongside her husband. There is a monument at Suippes which honours the four corporals following a decision by the local council in Suippes in 2004 to erect it given that the sentence by the military tribunal to execute the four men had been given in Suippes. The monument was inaugurated on 1 December 2007 and faces Suippes' town hall where the tribunal had sat on 16 March 1915. The inscription reads \"\u00c0 la m\u00e9moire des caporaux de Souain Theophile MAUPAS, Louis GIRARD, Lucien LECHAT et Louis LEFOULON Fusill\u00e9s pour l'exemple, \u00e0 SUIPPES, le 17 mars 1915\""

        "The cemetery is located in an area known as \" L'Esp\u00e9rance\u201d which is located near to the French military camp at Mourmelon and was erected in memory of those Russian soldiers killed on the battlefields of Champagne fighting alongside the French and British armies. Whilst the seeds of cooperation between France and Russia were sown during the visits to Champagne of NIcholas II back in 1896 and 1901, it was in December 1915 that the Russians signed an agreement with the French under which they were to be supplied with arms and munitions and in return they would send four infantry brigades comprising some 50,000 officers and soldiers to fight alongside the French and British forces. The 2nd and 4th Brigades would be sent to fight in Salonica in the Balkans, under General Sarrail, and the 1st and 3rd Brigades would fight alongside the French on the front-line in Champagne. In April 1916, Russian soldiers of the 1st Brigade, fully equipped and armed and wearing French issue helmets disembarked at Marseille and were sent to the military camp at Mailly and subsequently deployed in the sectors at Suippes and Aub\u00e9rive from where they were replaced by the 3rd Brigade in October 1916. The 1st Brigade, comprised the 1st and 2nd Regiments made up by men from Moscow and Samara whilst the 3rd, formed by the 3rd and 6th Regiments and raised in Ekaterinenbourg and Tcheliabinsk, were commanded by General Palitzine. From early 1917 the two brigades fighting in France occupied the Fort de la Pompelle near to Reims and took part in the Nivelle offensive in which they participated in the attack on Mont Spin and sustained heavy losses. When the Russian Revolution broke out in October 1917, the brigades were disbanded and withdrawn from the front. The officers, with some volunteers from the ranks, formed a \u201cL\u00e9gion russe d\u2019honneur\u201d and continued to fight until the end of the war whilst other soldiers asked to be sent back home. Those who stayed wore French uniforms and were absorbed into the Moroccan Regiment. Between 1916 and 1918 some 4,000 men were killed and some of these are buried in the Russian Cemetery. After the war and in honour of these Russian soldiers the survivors formed an association and through their efforts this cemetery was opened and at a later stage a 15th-century style chapel was added to it, built in the Russian Orthodox style. The cemetery contains the bodies of 915 Russian soldiers either buried in ossuaries or individual graves and included in the gallery at the end of this article is a photograph of a typical headstone and the marker for one of the ossuaries in the cemetery."

        "This monument stands at the junction of the Boulevard Giroud and the Rue Vasquier on the eastern side of Reims. The original monument was erected in July 1924 with the legend \" Aux h\u00e9ros de l'Arm\u00e9e noire\". It was a copy of the monument aux morts erected in Bamako. When the Germans occupied France in 1940 the monument was dismantled. It was in 1921 that a committee was set up in Paris to look at the contribution to the war effort made by black soldiers and how this could be marked. General Archinard was the chairman assisted by General Marchand. The committee were charged with arranging for monuments to be erected in Africa and France which celebrated the memory of the indigenous soldiers who had given their lives in the service of France and they proposed two locations, one in Reims and the other in Bamako the capital of what was then the French Sudan and is now Mali. On 29 October 1922 the first stone was laid by the Minister for War, Andr\u00e9 Maginot. The location was at the place where the Boulevard Henry Vasnier crossed the avenue du G\u00e9n\u00e9ral Giraud and where one would leave Reims if travelling to Chalons. In his speech Maginot recalled the bravery of Sergeant Amadou Di'ale of the 34th Bataillon of tirailleurs s\u00e9n\u00e9galais who had singlehandedly taken 130 Germans as prisoners and fought on for two days despite being wounded. Then in June 1924 shortly before the inauguration, the Marquis Melchior de Polignac of Pommery et Greno - Louise Pommery Fils et Compagnie had informed the mayor of Reims that this prestigious maker of champagne would cede to the town ownership of the ground upon which the monument stood. The inauguration took place on 13 July 1924 with \u00c9douard Daladier, Minister for the Colonies, officiating along with various other dignitaries. In his speech General Archinard who attended alongside Daladier mentioned in particular the contribution made by the 1st Corps of the Colonial Army in holding the Fort de la Pompelle and thus saving Reims from German occupation. The monument itself was the work of two Parisiens, the sculptor Paul Moreau-Vauthier and the architect Auguste Bluysen. It comprised a pedestal of 4 metres in height upon which were carved the names of the principal battles in which African troops participated and on top of the pedestal Moreau-Vauthier sculpted a 3 metres high bronze depicting a group of four soldiers of the colonial armies gathered around a white officer who carries the French National flag. As stated earlier the Germans pulled the monument down and it left Reims in a railway wagon perhaps for the bronze to be melted down to make armaments. At the beginning of the 1960s and with the end of the Algerian war, thoughts turned to building a replacement and a committee was formed in 1961 to consider this in detail and a competition was organised to choose a design. Progress was slow but on 6 October 1963, the new monument was unveiled by the Minister of War Pierre Messmer. It is modern in design and two columns in Euville stone represent the union of African and French soldiers and the block upon which these columns stand was intended to represent Reims' resistance in the 1914\u20131918 war."

It was inaugurated in 1930 by Philippe P\u00e9tain and the Minister of War Andr\u00e9 Maginot. The central statue in bronze shows a youth deep in thought. \"Pens\u00e9e accomplissant son effort de r\u00e9surrection\" There are reliefs on either side of this central figure. The relief on the left is entitled \"1914 le sacrifice\" and is dedicated to the families of the dead (\"Aux familles des morts pour exalter la grandeur de leur sacrifice.\") whilst that on the right bears the legend \"1918 la le\u00e7on du pass\u00e9\" and speaks to future generations reminding them not to forget the sacrifices of their parents.(\"Aux generations nouvelles pour qu\u2019elles sachent et se souviennent\"). A list of the names of the dead was sealed up with one of the memorial's bricks and there is a book in the Reims town hall which also contains this information Along the top is the inscription \u201cEnfants de Reims tombes au champ d\u2019honneur que ce monument edifie par votre ville meurtrie exprime \u00e0 jamais son deuil et sa fierte\" .

The monument \"\u00e0 la gloire des infirmi\u00e8res fran\u00e7aises et alli\u00e9es victimes de leur d\u00e9vouement\" was erected in Reims after the war and was financed by international subscriptions organised by a committee founded and run by Juliette Adam. The architect used was Charles Girault and the sculptural work is by Denys Puech. There is a list of all those who gave up their lives in Reims' town hall. The inauguration took place on 11 November 1924, and amongst those assembled for the ceremony were Cardinal Lu\u00e7on, the Archbishop of Reims, Pastor Gonin, Rabbi Hermann and General Pau."

Under the command of Lt Colonel Debailleul they successfully fought the Prussian Guard, taking 950 prisoners and capturing 10 of the German's guns. \"Regiment d'\u00e9lite sous l'\u00e9nergique commandement du lieutenant-colonel Debailleul a, le 23 octobre 1917, par une manoeuvre audacieuse difficile et remarquablement ex\u00e9cut\u00e9e, encercl\u00e9 et enlev\u00e9 de haute lutte les carri\u00e8res de la Boh\u00e9ry, s'est empar\u00e9 ensuite des lignes de tranch\u00e9es du Chemin des Dames que la garde prussienne avait l'ordre de d\u00e9fendre \u00e0 tout prix, puis progressant encore sous un feu violent d'artillerie et de mitrailleuses sur une profondeur de plus de deux kilom\u00e8tres et demi malgr\u00e9 des pertes sensibles, a atteint avec un entrain admirable tous les objectifs, infligeant \u00e0 l'ennemi de lourdes pertes, capturant 950 prisonniers dont 14 officiers, 10 canons, de 8 de gros calibre, et un nombreux mat\u00e9riel de guerre\""

        "The 1st Battalion Loyal North Lancashire Regiment were part of 2nd Brigade, 1st Division. Commanded by Lieutenant Colonel G.C.Knight and crossed from Southampton on 12 August 1914 aboard the SS \"Agapenor\". The battalion's first action was alongside the 2nd Royal Sussex of the same Brigade, at Priez on 10 September 1914, when Lieutenant Colonel Knight was mortally wounded. Following the charge of 4th Dragoon Guards, the battalion crossed the Aisne at Bourg on 13 September and advanced towards the Chemin des Dames, halting at Vendresse. From here the battalion attacked Troyon on 14 September 1914 and now under the command of Major (Acting Lieutenant Colonel) W.R.LLoyd. In this action the unit suffered heavy casualties with nine officers being killed, five wounded and 500 other ranks killed or wounded. Among the dead was Lt-Col Lloyd; the second commanding officer to be killed since arrival in France. The survivors dug in on the slopes of the Chemin des Dames and held these positions until relieved by 1st East Yorks on 19 September 1914. The 1st Loyals remained on the Aisne until mid-October when they were moved north to take part in the fighting in Flanders. It was here they lost their third commanding officer, Major A.J.Carter DSO, who was killed at Ypres in November 1914. On the crest of the ridge at Troyon the regiment erected a memorial to their read. The inscription on it reads \"In memory of the Officers, Warrant and non-commissioned Officers and men of the 1st Battalion of the Loyal North Lancashire Regiment who laid down their lives on active service 1914\u20131919\u201d Files held at the National Archives in Kew covers the years 1919 to 1923 and gives us further background information on this memorial. We read that C.T.Atkinson\u2019s who served on the committee whose approval was needed for memorials to be erected and to approve where they were to be located, wrote \"The 1st Loyal North Lancashire formed part in September 1914 of the 2nd Brigade, First Division commanded by Brigadier General Bulfin which acted as the advance-guard of Sir Douglas Haig\u2019s First Corps in the battle of September 14th 1914. The battalion, together with the whole of the 2nd Brigade, distinguished itself greatly by its attack on the portion of the Chemin des Dames, north of Vendress, Troyon and the services of the Brigade were warmly acknowledged both in the Divisional reports and in the published dispatches. There would be ample justification of the erection of a monument by the 1st Loyal North Lancashires at this spot\u2026..\""

The bronze sculpture is nearly 4 meters high and was designed by Haim Kern. It was unveiled on 5 November 1998 by the French First Minister Lionel Jospin accompanied by the Minister of Culture and Communication and the State Secretary to War Veterans. This work is entitled \"Ils n\u2019ont pas choisi leur s\u00e9pulture\" (they didn\u2019t choose their grave). Kern's composition is enigmatic and presents what appears to be metal netting in which the faces of soldiers appear at intervals. They appear trapped in the meshing and unable to escape. They are, as it were, caught in a situation that has resulted in their death but they are lost, as their remains were lost, and could not be found."

        "This cemetery is situated south east of Reims and is a part of the French cemetery at Le Bois du Puits. The outbreak of the 1914\u20131918 war gave many Poles hope of a Polish renaissance as at that time so much of Poland had been absorbed into the empires of Germany, Russia and Austro-Hungary. There were numerous Poles working in the mines of Northern France as well as a good number of businessmen, traders and intellectuals living in Paris and many of these rallied to the Committee for Polish Volunteers' call in August 1914 and joined the Foreign Legion to fight against the Germans and Austro-Hungarians. Russia was another matter as Russia was now an ally of France so the Poles had to be pragmatic. These Poles were given military training in Bayonne and at the Reuilly barracks in Paris and then integrated into the 2nd and 3rd Infantry Regiments of the 1st Foreign Legion. In 1915 they joined the front line troops in Champagne, Picardy and Artois and Poland's red flag with white eagle was seen to fly in these areas. In June 1917 a Presidential Law was passed which created an official Polish army and in January 1918 the 1st Regiment \"de chasseurs polonaise\" was formed, its numbers swollen by Polish volunteers arriving from the United States of America and the enrolment of 1,500 German prisoners of war who were of Polish extraction. This unit was subsequently attached to the 163rd Infantry Regiment, part of Gouraud's IVth Army. Further volunteers joined the ranks and the 1st and 2nd Divisions of Polish Infantry were formed. They were to fight in Champagne, the Vosges and in Lorraine. On 11 November 1918, Poland was declared independent and Marshal Pilsudski asked for the Polish army in France to be repatriated. This Polish cemetery contains the bodies of Polish soldiers killed in both World Wars. There are 385 bodies buried in the cemetery and 129 of these were men killed in the 1914\u20131918 war. At the entrance to the cemetery there is a small memorial dedicated to these 129 men and in the middle of the cemetery there is a monument to the men of the 1st and 2nd Divisions. It comprises an obelisk surmounted by a cross."

Five years later, Lacey is part of the popular crowd, while Jo is a social outcast; the two no longer friends. Newly released, Danny tries to reconnect with the girls. Jo warms up to him and they go to a party thrown by Regina, Lacey's best friend. Lacey also begins to warm up to Danny when they share a bag of chips in Danny's bedroom later in the evening. That night, Regina texts Danny that she knows why he killed his aunt. The next day, she is found murdered, the necklace from her neck the only thing missing. Danny becomes the prime suspect, and it is revealed that he has the necklace. Note: This episode aired again on June 11, 2013, and received 1.61m viewers.",

With Rico's advice to try harder with Lacey, Jo offers to attend the birthday party for moral support. She then discovers Lacey's father and Mitch (Clara's gymnastic coach) kissing in the pantry. Meanwhile, Danny is keeping his own secret from his best friends and decides it may be time to come clean about how Regina got the necklace. Episode ends with Rico receiving the shocking video of Danny and Lacey that has the potential to destroy friendships and reputations."

        "At the \"Moulin de Laffaux\" is a monument dedicated to the trench mortar operators who fell in the region in the 1914\u20131918 war. The monument is shaped like the bomb fired by the trench mortar and pays tribute to the 12,000 trench mortar operators who fell in the war. A plaque by the monument informs us that it was damaged in June 1940 during fighting nearby and repaired - \"Ce monument \u00e9rig\u00e9 en 1933 pour honorer la m\u00e9moire des 12 000 crapouillots artilleurs de tranch\u00e9e tomb\u00e9s de 1914 \u00e0 1918 sur les fronts de France et d\u2019Orient, mutil\u00e9 par le feu de la batille de juin 1940, a \u00e9t\u00e9 reconstruit afin de perp\u00e9tuer le souvenir de ceux qui sont morts pour le salut de la France. 22 juin 1958\" The trench mortar was called a \u201cCrapouillot\u201d because the projectile fired from the mortar seemed to hop from the trench from which it was fired to its target, reminding the soldiers of a toad (Crapaud in French). The monument bears the inscription \u201cAux Morts de l\u2019Artillerie de Tranchee- Les Crapouillots\u201d"

The monument is in the form of a tower and inside the tower and visible through the grill in the door is a brief summary of the American operations in this area. It is possible to climb to the top of the tower to an observation platform when the tower is open to visitors.

        "Given the huge loss of life which the area was to see over the four years of war it comes as no surprise that it holds many military cemeteries. During the 1920s, French graves which were scattered throughout the area where moved into 14 central cemeteries. In some cases these cemeteries have also absorbed British or Russian casualties and although they are in the Chemin des Dames area some of the cemeteries hold the bodies of men killed at Soissons or in the Battle of the Marne. Conversely the French military cemetery of Maison Bleue (in Cornicy) and situated in the department of the Marne, shelters combatants who had fallen on the Chemin des Dames and in particular in the area of Berry-au-Bac. These 14 French Military cemeteries located in the Chemin des Dames area are- Berry-au-Bac French National cemetery- contains 3,971 bodies of which 3,933 are French, 31 British (2 from WWII), 6 Russian and 1 Belgian. Of the French graves, 2,014 soldiers are in individual graves and 1,958 rest in two ossuaries. Braine French National cemetery- Contains the bodies of 1,583 French soldiers. 1,088 of these are in individual and collective graves and another 495 are buried in ossuaries. Cerny-en-Laonnois French National cemetery- contains the bodies of 5,150 French soldiers and 54 Russian soldiers. Of the French graves 2,764 are in individual and collective graves and another 2,386 soldiers were buried in ossuaries. Crouy French National cemetery- Contains the bodies of 2,994 soldiers. 2,941 of these are French soldiers of which 1,465 are buried in individual graves and 1,476 rest in ossuaries. Craonnelle French National cemetery- contains the bodies of 3,910 French soldiers, 1,884 of whom are in ossuaries. There are 24 graves of British soldiers scattered between the French ones and only 7 of these could be identified. Oeuilly French National cemetery - contains the bodies of 1,159 French soldiers in individual and collective graves. Cemetery also the location of a memorial to the 163rd French Infantry. Pontavert French National cemetery- Contains the bodies of 6,815 soldiers. There are 6,694 French soldiers buried in individual graves and 1,364 in ossuaries. Cemetery also holds 67 British graves and those of 54 Russians. Soupir n\u00b01 French National cemetery- Contains 7,808 bodies of which 3,088 lie in three ossuaries. This military cemetery also has 4 communal graves, which contains 266 bodies coming from sites of Veil-Arcy, Athies-sous-Laon, Glennes and Pargny-Filain; as well as the grave of a Belgian soldier and of a Russian soldier. Soupir n\u00b02 French National cemetery- Contains the graves of 1,966 French soldiers with another 250 laid in ossuaries, Also holds 2 British, 5 Belgian, 27 Russian and 1 German grave.

Vauxbuin French National cemetery- Holds the graves of 4,916 soldiers. There are 9 German cemeteries in the area. Some of these cemeteries were laid out by the German Army during the war (Veslud, Laon-Bousson and Montaigu in particular) and the others were built by the French authorities in the beginning of the 1920s in accordance with the Treaty of Versailles which had stated that the victorious countries had the exclusive right to organise the German graves. Again in the 1920s bodies in individual graves scattered around the area were concentrated into these 9 cemeteries. In 1966 management and care of the cemeteries was passed to the \"Service d\u2019Entretien des S\u00e9pultures militaries\", the French subsidiary of the German Volksbund Deutsche Krieggr\u00e4berf\u00fcrsorge. These cemeteries are:- Cerny-en-Laonnois German cemetery-Cemetery holds 7,526 graves. 3,533 soldiers have individual graves and 3,993 rest in an ossuary. Laon-Champ de man\u0153uvre German cemetery Laon-Bousson German cemetery- Holds the graves of 2,653 German soldiers. Montaigu n\u00b01 German cemetery- Holds 7,192 German soldiers with 5,402 of these buried in individual and collective graves and 1,790 laid to frest in an ossuary.

Vauxbuin German Cemetery- 9,229 German soldiers are buried here, 5,557 of which rest in four ossuaries. The Chemin des Dames area contains 5 British military cemeteries although many British graves still remain within Chemin des Dames communal cemeteries and some of the British dead from the Chemin des Dames are buried in Grand-Seraucourt British military cemetery, near St-Quentin, and in Montcornet British cemetery, both of which are located outside the Chemin des Dames area. The graves of many British soldiers can also be found in French military cemeteries, in particular in Vauxbuin French military cemetery, Berry-au-Bac military cemetery and in Crouy French military cemetery, The British Cemeteries are:- Grand-Seraucourt British cemetery- Almost 2,000 British soldiers are buried here. La Ville-aux-Bois-les-Pontavert British cemetery- 564 British and 1 New Zealand soldiers graves are in this cemetery. It was in this area that the British 8th, 21st and 50th Divisions were resting in the spring of 1918 when on 27 May 1918 Ludendorff launched his \"Spring Offensive\". In this cemetery is a monument dedicated to the Devonshire Regiment who took part in the subsequent fighting against Ludendorff's soldiers. Montcornet British Cemetery- 119 British and 1 Canadian servicemen are buried here. Sissonne British cemetery- 291 Commonwealth soldiers are buried here. Soupir British cemetery- Contains 36 Commonwealth soldier's graves. Vendresse British cemetery- Holds 728 British graves. Vailly-sur-Aisne British Cemetery- Holds 674 British graves, I Canadian, I French and I German grave. The area also holds the Oise-Aisne American cemetery at Seringes-Nesles. In this cemetery are buried 6,012 soldiers most of them casualties of the fighting in the area north of the river (Aisne) and beyond. The names of 241 soldiers whose remains were never found are written on the walls of the cemetery's chapel. The Oise-Aisne military cemetery was created on the very spot where the 42nd American Division, the so-called \u201cRainbow Division\u201d fought. Among the 6,012 graves is that of the poet Joyce Kilmer, a sergeant in the 165th Regiment (42nd Division), who was killed on 30 July 1918. There is also a Danish cemetery at Braine which contains the graves of 79 Danish soldiers. The Danish cemetery at Braine is situated nearby the N31-E46 at around ten kilometres from Soissons and more precisely on the side of the D14 in direction of Reims, near the French military cemetery. This holds the graves of 79 Danish soldiers. They came from Schleswig, a territory annexed by Prussia in 1886 and they had no choice but to serve in the German ranks and sacrifice themselves for a cause that wasn\u2019t theirs. To commemorate their tragic fate on French soil, a Committee (in Denmark with a section in Paris) was charged with the task of gathering the bodies together to be re-buried at Braine. There is a monument designed by the Danish architect Gundlach-Petersen in the cemetery which was unveiled on 7 May 1934. Representatives from the Danish and French Government attended to the ceremony."

        "The Fort at Malmaison had been abandoned as a fort by the French in 1914 because of its poor condition but the Germans found it quite useful and it soon became integrated into their defensive system. The Battle of Malmaison was fought on 23 October 1917 and after the failure of the Nivelle offensive, P\u00e9tain, who had replaced Nivelle, focused on restoring his soldiers morale. He knew that they needed a small scale victory that would give them faith in themselves and more importantly - restore their faith in their commanders. Malmaison was chosen to be the location for this battle. It needed to be well organised with all the tanks, aircraft and shells needed, casualties were to be kept to a minimum and this time the casualty services would be up to the task. General Maistre had taken over the 6th Army from Mangin and it was his sector that was allotted the battle. With just three Corps - the 11th, 21st and 14th, they would take the western end of the Chemin des Dames and with it the Fort at Malmaison. On 17 October 1917, the artillery bombardment of the fort began and it was soon reduced to a crumpled mess. At 05:15 hours on the 23rd, following a final crescendo from the guns, the troops \"went over the top\". They advanced as they had not done for months, things were going to plan and objectives were being taken even if after a hard struggle. The 11th Corps who were charged with taking the Fort took the majority of the casualties but 554 soldiers from the 4th Regiment of Zouaves charged the fort and by 06:00 hours it was theirs. As the French paused to prepare their second attack, the Germans thinking they had the French beaten launched a counter-attack but ran headlong into the second French barrage. On the 25th P\u00e9tain called a halt to his operation as he felt he had achieved all that he had set out to do. He had lost about 2,000 dead and 14 000 wounded over the three days - mostly from the 11th Corps but many prisoners were taken and the Germans suffered at least twice the casualties as the French. More importantly, the loss of this position acted as a lever against the remainder of the German line on the Chemin des Dames and over the next week the Germans were forced to give up the ridge to the French. A well prepared and limited attack had therefore taken territory that Nivelle's full frontal assault had only dented. On 27 May 1918 during their Spring Offensive the Germans retook the fort (or at least what was left of it) and the remainder of the ridge within three hours. The whirlwind nature of the attack had been too much for the defenders to stand but at 1130 hours on 28 September 1918, the 25th Alpine Chasseurs retook the fort and the Germans were pushed out of the Aisne for good."

The architect used was Charles Girault and the sculptural work is by Denys Puech. There is a list of all those who gave up their lives in Reims' town hall.

        "From September 1914 to September 1918, the region between Reims and the For\u00eat d'Argonne saw fierce fighting mostly between French and German forces but also involving Russians and Americans. Indeed in the area known as the \"Red Zone\", 7 villages were so badly damaged that they were never rebuilt and have for all intents and purposes disappeared. These villages were in an area now occupied by the French military camps of Moronvilliers and of Suippes. What were the villages of Nauroy and Moronvilliers are in the area of the Moronvilliers camp and here there is a small commemorative chapel that remembers them, erected in 1920, and positioned where Nauroy would have stood. This chapel has been restored by \"L'Amicale des Diables bleus d'\u00c9pernay\" The village name of \"Nauroy\" is now attached to that of the nearby village of \"Beine\" thus we have \"Nauroy-Beine\". The site where Moronvilliers stood cannot be accessed as it is within the military camp. Its name has been added to that of nearby \"Pontfaverger\". The villages located with the camp at Suippes were Perthes-les-Hurlus, Hurlus, Le Mesnil-les-Hurlus, Ripont and Tahure. East then of Reims and before we reach the battlefields of the Argonne and St.Mihiel, we have a portion of the Western Front which runs from the Mont de Moronvillers, across the ridge at Navarin, through the hills of Souhain, the Tahure du Mesnil and to La Main de Massiges. There were trenches all along this area of the front line and frequent fighting between the French and Germans but the area is difficult to explore now as the French Army Camps at Moronvillers, Mourmelon and Suippes cut across the old Front Line, although the French Army do allow access in the September of every second year, organising bus tours and the like. This allows visits to the five ruined villages which lie in the camp area: it is known as \u201cLa Journ\u00e9e des Villages D\u00e9truits\u201d- Perthes-les-Hurlus/Hurlus/Le Mesnil-les-Hurlus/Ripont and Tahure are the villages. At Souhain there is a Monument and ossuary dedicated to the French Foreign Legion. In the winter 1914\u201315 there were many smaller skirmishes and on 25 September 1915, a French offensive gained some ground. In April\u2013May 1917 the Massif of Moronvillers was retaken from the Germans and on 15 July 1918 General Gouraud\u2019s 4th Army were able to repulse the German attack which formed part of their Spring Offensive. Finally a successful Franco-American offensive on 26 September 1918 saw the liberation of Sommepy and ended with the taking of Sedan on 11 November 1918. The area measures 30 kilometres in length and 4 kilometres in depth and in this small area over the four years of war, 103 different French Divisions were engaged along with 4 American Divisions and 2 Russian Brigades, as well as Polish and Czechoslovakian units."

        "Situated 45 kilometres east of Reims, the \"Le Monument aux morts des Arm\u00e9es de Champagne\" was inaugurated in 1924 by General Gouraud, the Military Governor of Paris who commanded the IVth French army in Champagne in 1916 and again from June 1917 until the final victory of November 1918. The monument is not run and maintained by the State but by the organisation \"Monument aux morts des Arm\u00e9es de Champagne et Ossuaire de Navarin\". Near to the village of Souhain is a Celtic Cross marking the memorial to the French 28th Infantry Brigade and also the imposing monument of the \u201cFerme de Navarin\". The monument is a pyramid like structure with a sculpture of three soldiers at the top. It is a combined monument and ossuary within which lie the remains of 10,000 soldiers who fell on the plains of Champagne. The monument is situated in what had been a farm in 1916, the farm of Navarin. The story was that the farmer, when approached by soldiers for provisions, had replied in the local patois \u201cAnhue n\u2019ava rin\u201d- \u201cAujourd\u2019hui il n\u2019y a rien\u201d- \u201cToday I have nothing.\u201d This became \"Navarin\" to the French soldiers. Navarin is a port where French, British and Russians had destroyed the Turkish fleet in 1827 during the War for Greek Independence. The middle figure of the three soldiers at the summit of the structure, the work of the sculptor Maxime Real del Sarte, is meant to portray Gouraud himself, the soldier on the right Quentin Roosevelt, a nephew of President Theodore Roosevelt who was killed in the Cambrai area on 14 July 1918 and the figure on the left represents del Sarte\u2019s brother who was killed in the Champagne area. At the base of the monument are listed the numerous divisions who fought in Champagne- 93 French Infantry Divisions, 8 Cavalry Divisions, a general artillery reserve, an aerial division, 4 American Divisions- including the 42nd Division one of whose officers was the future General MacArthur, the 1st Polish Regiment, 2 Russian Brigades and a Czech Brigade. In the crypt are the remains of 10,000 soldiers, including the four sons of Paul Doumer a President of France in the 1930s and when General Gouraud died in 1946 he had asked to be buried with his men in the \u201cFerme de Navarin\u201d and his tomb has pride of place in the crypt."

        "Given the huge loss of life which the area was to see over the four years of war it comes as no surprise that it holds many military cemeteries. During the 1920s, French graves which were scattered throughout the area where moved into 14 central cemeteries. In some cases these cemeteries have also absorbed British or Russian casualties and although they are in the Chemin des Dames area some of the cemeteries hold the bodies of men killed at Soissons or in the Battle of the Marne. Conversely the French military cemetery of Maison Bleue (in Cornicy) and situated in the department of the Marne, shelters combatants who had fallen on the Chemin des Dames and in particular in the area of Berry-au-Bac. These 14 French Military cemeteries located in the Chemin des Dames area are- Berry-au-Bac French National cemetery- contains 3,971 bodies of which 3,933 are French, 31 British (2 from WWII), 6 Russian and 1 Belgian. Of the French graves, 2,014 soldiers are in individual graves and 1,958 rest in two ossuaries. Braine French National cemetery- Contains the bodies of 1,583 French soldiers. 1,088 of these are in individual and collective graves and another 495 are buried in ossuaries.

The Oise-Aisne military cemetery was created on the very spot where the 42nd American Division, the so-called \u201cRainbow Division\u201d fought. Among the 6,012 graves is that of the poet Joyce Kilmer, a sergeant in the 165th Regiment (42nd Division), who was killed on 30 July 1918. There is also a Danish cemetery at Braine which contains the graves of 79 Danish soldiers. The Danish cemetery at Braine is situated nearby the N31-E46 at around ten kilometres from Soissons and more precisely on the side of the D14 in direction of Reims, near the French military cemetery. This holds the graves of 79 Danish soldiers. They came from Schleswig, a territory annexed by Prussia in 1886 and they had no choice but to serve in the German ranks and sacrifice themselves for a cause that wasn\u2019t theirs. To commemorate their tragic fate on French soil, a Committee (in Denmark with a section in Paris) was charged with the task of gathering the bodies together to be re-buried at Braine. There is a monument designed by the Danish architect Gundlach-Petersen in the cemetery which was unveiled on 7 May 1934. Representatives from the Danish and French Government attended to the ceremony."

        "This monument celebrates one of the officers of the R.I.C.M, Captain Joost van Vollenhoven, a former Governor of French West Africa, who was killed in the nearby village of Pharmacy in 1918. The monument shows the Captain leading his men for the last time, as well as scenes from his previous service in the colonies of Africa and Indochina. Citations to both the Regiment and van Vollenhoven adorn the sides of the monument. Like some of the other monuments in the area it was badly damaged by the German occupiers during the 2nd World War but restored after the war. Joost van Vollenhoven, as his name would suggest, was Dutch by birth. His parents had commercial interests in Algeria and this is where he grew up, eventually taking French citizenship in 1899 at the age of 22. He joined the French Foreign Office and in 1912 he was in Indochina serving as Governor. At the outbreak of war he was promoted to Goveror General in Hanoi but he was anxious to serve in the army and in April 1915 he joined the R.I.C.M. After being wounded numerous times and having received several citations for valour, he was asked in May 1917 to return to his Civil Service duties and take up a post as Governor General of French West Africa - this at the age of 40 but this posting did not last long and he soon rejoined his old regiment, this time as a Captain. It was in July 1918 that the R.I.C.M. attacked the Germans from the Forest of Retz and it was during this action that Vollenhoven was fatally wounded. On 22 July 1918 the French 38th Division (of which the RICM were a part) was relieved by the British 34th Division."

        "This small French Military Cemetery is located near to Ch\u00e2lons-en-Champagne and not far from Saint-Hilaire-le-Grand and the monument to the 28th Brigade stands on a hill in the cemetery facing the Wacques Farm. 147 French soldiers are buried in the cemetery. The memorial consists of a large cross or calvary, which carries the inscription \"Aux morts de la XXVIIIe Brigade\" and is surrounded in a circle by many smaller crosses. It was from 25 to 30 September 1915, that the 28th Brigade, comprising the 35th and 42nd Infantry from Belfort, fought in this area and lost 1,133 men including 39 officers. Another 1,362 men were injured including 48 officers. It was after the war that the chaplain of the 28th Brigade and several volunteers from the 35th and 42nd Infantry returned to the battlefield to locate and bury the rest of their colleagues killed in 1915, assisted by some Austrian prisoners and some labourers from Indochina stationed at Suippes. A committee was duly set up to arrange to raise funds to finance the erection of a calvary at Wacques and the monument and cemetery was inaugurated on 25 September 1919. In 1922 when the large cemetery at Souain called \"La Crou\u00e9e\" was established it was agreed that the small cemetery at Wacques be left on its own rather than be absorbed into \"La Crou\u00e9e\". This smaller cemetery is officially named the \"N\u00e9cropole nationale de Souain - 28e Brigade\" There is a smaller memorial next to the \"Wacques Cross\" and this is dedicated to the men of the 44th Infantry and carries the inscription \"Aux camarades tomb\u00e9s pendant les journ\u00e9es du 25-26-27-28-29 Septembre 1915.Etat-Major\" and nearby another memorial dedicated to the 60th Infantry, this inscribed \"Aux morts du 60e RI Attaques des 25 au 29 - 09 - 1915\""

        "The monument aux morts at Sillery, inaugurated in 1925, features a sculpture by \u00c9douard Sediey that seems to sum up the horrors of the 1914\u20131918 war and the sadness and despair that the enormous loss of life had caused. Sediey's composition would not be out of place in England, France or Germany or any of the parts of the world touched by the conflict. In front of the cross is a young woman, totally distraught, who could be a mother, a sister or daughter and on the cross are inscribed the names of the dead and the words \"Sillery \u00e0 ses morts glorieux 1914\u20131918\" Just by this memorial is another dedicated to the martyrs of the Resistance. It is a Cross of Lorraine upon which are carved the faces of three of those deported by the Germans and the names of 8 people who died while deported. It reminds us of miseries yet to come for the people of France."

The inscription reminds us of the actions of the regiment from September to October 1915 which saw 80 officers and 7,000 soldiers die. The Borne is one of the series created by Paul Moreau-Vauthier to mark the furthest points along the Western Front that the German army advanced to. Those bornes in France were made from pink granite from Andlau in Alsace. This borne bears the inscription \"Ici fut repouss\u00e9 l\u2019envahisseur Juillet 1918 which would correspond with the date of the liberation of Ch\u00e2teau-Thierry."

        "One of the memorials on the Chemin des Dames is that to the people of the Basque Country who lost their lives on the Chemin des Dames. The memorial was erected in 1928. The 36th Infantry Division, notably the Infantry Regiment of Pau, the 34th Infantry Regiment of Mont-de-Marsan and the 14th Artillery Regiment of Tarbes, was composed mostly of recruits from the southwest region of France: The Landes, Hautes Pyrenees and Basses Pyrenees. It was involved in fighting on the Chemin des Dames on many occasions and suffered very heavy losses whilst attacking or defending difficult positions in particular between Hurtebrise and Craonne and on the Californie Plateau. In September 1914, the 36th Infantry Division attempted in vain to hold French positions on the crest of the Chemin des Dames. From 4 to 6 May 1917 it attacked Californie Plateau and managed to occupy it. Losses were extremely high but the 36th Division returned to the front on 3 and 4 June 1917 and was on the receiving end of a fierce German counterattack. The 36th Division returned again to the Chemin des Dames on 15 September 1918 when it went into the attack in the Allemant sector and fighting continued until the German retreat beyond the Aisne in October 1918. The Basque Monument was unveiled on 30 September 1928, the ceremony being attended by many war veterans, widows and orphans who had made the journey for the occasion. Both the architect Forest and the sculptor Claude Grange were veterans themselves and had been wounded in the war. The stone used is from Souppes near Melun, the stone used for the Arc de Triomphe and the basilica of Sacre-Coeur at Montmartre. At the base of a 14 metre high obelisk laurel wreaths bear the names of the administrative areas from which soldiers of the 36th Infantry Division came and the sides bear the division\u2019s monogram. A Basque stands at the foot of the obelisk in traditional, civilian costume and looks towards the Aisne Valley. He wears the \"b\u00e9ret basque\". See images below."

It is intended as a place for reflexion and spiritual refuge for all who visit the battlefield area. On 8 July 1962, during a private visit to the German Cemetery, Chancellor Konrad Adenauer was met by President Charles de Gaulle in what became a precursor to the Franco-German Treaty of 1963. In front of the chapel is a white lighthouse and behind, two cemeteries, one French the other German. In front of the Chapel is a plaque commemorating the deeds of the 38th Division."

The actual monument was the design of the architect \u00c9mile Fanjat and was funded by subscriptions raised by the veterans of the 132nd in particular to honour the men who were killed fighting in the \u00c9parges between 23 October 1914 and 12 April 1915. The inscription on the monument reads \"Aux morts des 132e et 332e R\u00e9giments d'infanterie et du 46e R\u00e9giment territorial d'infanterie\" The soldier on the top of the monument is the work of Paul Lef\u00e8bvre who worked on the Reims monument aux morts."

        "The Fort of la Pompelle played a vital role in the defence of Reims throughout the war and early in 1918 the Germans attacked the fort in great strength in an effort to capture it. The German's failed, with the 6th Company of the 21st Colonial Infantry Regiment carrying out a successful defence. On 15 July 1918, Ludendorf launched the last German offensive along the Champagne front and the 7th Colonial Infantry Regiment, who at that time were defending the fort, fought off an attack which was to be the last against the fort. Nevertheless until 5 October 1918, when the Germans evacuated their positions in front of Reims, the fort was still subjected to frequent artillery bombardments. The organisation \"Souvenir Fran\u00e7ais\" organised a memorial at the \"Ferme d\u2019Alger\" inscribed \"Aux h\u00e9ros de la Grande Guerre\", 4 kilom\u00e8tres from Reims on the Route Nationale 44, direction Ch\u00e2lons-sur-Marne, as this was where most of the fighting took place to defend the Fort de la Pompelle. The monument was restored in 1998 on the 80th anniversary of the 1918 armistice and carries the inscription \"En m\u00e9moire des soldats tomb\u00e9s h\u00e9ro\u00efquement pour la d\u00e9fense du secteur Septembre 1914-Octobre 1918\""
