Mikako's fears of a love triangle are assuaged when Yuusuke piggybacking Tsutomu races by with the exhortation to set course for Mariko's place after school where the Akindo members synthesize merchandise for the next flea market while Mariko sleeps. An unexpected phone call brightens Mariko's mood as she customizes herself before departing for a euphoric nocturnal engagement with Yuusuke right on her heels; her deception nullified, Mariko explains that the suitors interested in her have become bothersome and that she really wants to do karaoke with her girlfriends.

While Ayumi leads the girls through making the best of their assigned room, the boys decide to soak in the hot spring . . . right after they excavate it from scratch, that is; alas, although their co-ed bathing volition is extinguished, the boys find that the newly excavated hot spring hits the spot after all their hard work. The all-natural dinner and the cacophonous concert of the manager that night gives way to having it explained that there is a couple from Tokyo residing in the mountains. Hitoshi and Shiori are wonderful hosts as they explain their prologue to the Akindo members who return to Tokyo with the lesson that happiness is ultimately within the perspective of the beholder."
