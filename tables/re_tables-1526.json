Increasing store with loss - can be the object of win in the line above, increasing being adjectival, in that the land wins an increasing store of territory from the ocean, with some losses. Then it receives further losses, with some gains. Or increasing can be a present participle referring to the firm soil, giving the meaning 'the firm soil triumphs in its battle against the sea, increasing its holdings, albeit with some loss, then increasing its losses with some compensatory gains (not as much as the losses)'. With either grammatical interpretation the meaning is fairly evident. Perhaps more important is the fact that the sound of the line is like the sound of a wave approaching and then receding, approaching and receding. Store = a holding, something kept, something reserved to be put aside."

        "Will is leaving for college in Seattle and his new roommate, Tucker, comes to meet him. Bailey feels threatened by his presence, and they have a fight. Bailey finds his jeep and decides to live in a dorm to meet people and move on with his life. Kirsten gets a job far away and they have to deal with the distance. She tells Charlie that if they were married things might have been different. Meanwhile, Julia wants the immature and irresponsible Griffin to find a place of his own and gives him some money, but he spends all the money (and his) buying her a car to impress her. Later, Julia gets fired from her receptionist job after Griffin shows up there and confronts her stern boss after he won't leave. Julia and Griffin then have a serious argument where she tells him to grow up and stop acting like a lovesick wild child, and Griffin yells back claiming that he's always had a problem with authority stemming from his lifelong abuse and mistreatment by his abusive father. Afterwards, Griffin decides to leave town to settle in San Diego with the Merchant Marines to move on with his life and give Julia some space. Claudia wants her relationship with Byron to be just like Julia and Griffin's, but Byron is more interested in Julia than in her. As a result, Claudia breaks up with Byron and unfairly blames Julia for stealing her boyfriend.",

They try to talk to Bailey about it, but he won't listen. Taking advantage of Julia and Charlie's fight, Bailey gets Charlie to support him. Meanwhile, Julia and Claudia don't like Grace living at their house. Grace thinks that moving in with Charlie was not a good idea after she has an encounter with a woman at a grocery store while shopping with Charlie and Owen in which the woman mistakes Grace as being the nanny instead of Charlie's girlfriend. Charlie tells Claudia she should try to be Grace's friend, so Claudia offers to volunteer at her program, but that doesn't last long. It is revealed that the non-maternal Grace can't stand the kids. Charlie wonders if Grace really wants to be there."

At the same time, Sarah gets dumped her boyfriend. Her mother tells Bailey that she got into Brown University (Sarah's disapproving parents are trying to keep her away from Bailey). Bailey gets mad at her because she is moving away, but she decides to go to Berkeley instead. They kiss, but Sarah tells Bailey that she just wants to be friends with him. Meanwhile, Charlie and Grace break up because she reveals that she doesn't like children. Charlie, although telling Grace that he does love her, says that his parental responsibilities come first.

In this alternate world, set during a weekend of planning Nick and Diana Salinger's 31st anniversary party, all of the siblings are insecure with their parents, whom they cannot stand up to. Bailey is revealed to be living with Will and both of them work as roadies for a heavy metal rock band after Bailey dropped out of college and never stopped drinking or grew up. Charlie appears better off having gone back to college, earning Master's degree in architecture, and is a fairly wealthy man working in a prestigious company. But like Bailey, Charlie never met Kirsten or ever grew up. He has to deal with his pregnant girlfriend getting an abortion, where he meets Kirsten for the first time working as a medical consultant at an abortion clinic. Julia also never grew up and has been engaged to Justin for years, which changes when she meets Griffin for the first time and loses her virginity with him. Claudia, on the other hand, is a home-schooled violinist, having gone on various world tours in which she wants to quit her profession for a little rest. All of them, nevertheless, come together for their parents' anniversary party at Salinger's Restaurant. At the end, Bailey wakes up from his fantasy and decides to seek help for himself.",

However, Brigid's name is derived from Brigit (also spelled Brigid, Br\u00ecghde, Br\u00ecde, and Br\u00edde), a Celtic Goddess of fire, poetry, and smithcraft, and today the cross is used to protect houses from fire. This is an example of the integration of religious traditions."

        "Six months after their parents were killed in a car accident involving a drunk driver, the five Salinger orphans are struggling to make ends meet and keep their family together to raise their 10-month old newest brother Owen. They try to search for a replacement for Owen's 65-year-old nanny, Mrs. Kelleher, who suddenly quits. Bailey assumes most of the responsibility for the family and develops a romantic crush on the attractive grad student Kirsten Bennett, whom he hires on the spot as Owen's new nanny. Julia turns her back on the family and household chores after a classmate named P.K. shows an interest in her. After her heart is broken, she longs for her mother's advice and comfort. Meanwhile, the womanizing and immature Charlie loses $12,000 of the family's money after being scamed in an ill-conceived real estate investment. Joe Mangus, their father's partner in Salingers Restaurant, lends Charlie enough money to tide them over, on the condition that Charlie work at Salingers as a bartender, a job which Charlie accepts reluctantly. Young Claudia pawns her violin and announces that she'd rather be a regular kid than a child prodigy. Her violin instructor, Ross Werkman, reminds her that she has a rare gift and encourages her to stick with it.",
