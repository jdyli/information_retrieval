From all the villages and towns of Cilicia, Anatolia, and Mesopotamia the Armenian Christians were driven forth on their death march; the work was done systematically, clearing out one district after another, whether the population happened to be near the scene of war or hundreds of kilometres away from it. There was to be a clean sweep of all Armenians. As the majority of men had already been taken for war work, it was chiefly a matter of turning women, children, and the aged and crippled out of house and home. They were only given a few days' or hours' notice. They had to leave behind all their property: houses, fields, crops, cattle, furniture, tools, and implements. Everything was confiscated by the Turkish authorities. The things they managed to carry with them, such as money, jewellery, or other valuables, and even clothes, were subsequently taken away from them by the gendarmes; and if any of them had been allowed to take their wagons and draught animals, the gendarmes appropriated them on the way. The poor creatures were rounded up from the different villages and driven in long columns across the mountains to the Arabian desert plains, where no provision had been made for the reception and maintenance of these herds of starving wretches, just as nothing had been done to keep them alive on the march.

The righteous Vali of Aleppo, too, was sent away, and the fiendish work ordered against the \"Christian nation\" still went on.\" Riggs also describes how he appealed on behalf of the Armenians to the central government in Constantinople: \"Having failed in his efforts to save all, and brokenhearted at the thought of this final tragedy. Dr. Shepard started for Aleppo to make one last appeal. Nothing could be accomplished there. \"The orders were from higher up.\" So the doctor decided to take his appeal higher, and set out on the long journey to Constantinople.

He was against the initial orders from German ambassador Vangenheim to limit the accusations of the anti-Armenian measures to friendly advice. Scheubner-Richter believed that the Armenians had no capabilities to start an uprising against the Ottoman government since all of the able bodied men were arrested and sent to labor battalions. Scheubner-Richter, who attempted to save the lives of as many Armenians as he could, believed that the deportations were based on \"racial hatred\" and that none can survive such a journey.

Only by a forceful policy of extermination, a powerful destruction of the entire people, can the Turkish government achieve its desired goal, the 'solution' of the Armenian question.\" \"The order of Kamil Pasha to deport all Armenians from Erzurum is not legitimate from a military point of view and in my opinion is founded on racial hatred.\" \"I have conducted a series of conversations with competent and influential Turkish personages, and these are my impressions: A large segment of the Ittihadist party maintains the viewpoint that the Turkish empire should be based only on the principle of Islam and Pan-Turkism. Its non-Muslim and non-Turkish inhabitants should either be forcibly islamized, or otherwise they ought to be destroyed. These gentleman believe that the time is propitious for the realization of this plan. The first item on this agenda concerns the liquidation of the Armenians. Ittihad will dangle before the eyes of the allies the specter of an alleged revolution prepared by the Armenian Dashnak party. Moreover, local incidents of the social unrest and acts of Armenian self-defense will deliberately be provoked and inflated and will be used as pretexts to effect the deportations. Once en route, however, the convoys will be attacked and exterminated by Kurdish and Turkish brigands, and in part by gendarmes, who will be instigated for that purpose by Ittihad.\""

Just as they arrive, they see the scene of a dust store robbery. The officers speculate the White Fang are responsible for the crime, though Ruby suspects Torchwick. At the mention of the White Fang, Weiss becomes incensed and gets into an argument with Blake about the group and the Faunus. In the meantime, Sun Wukong, a monkey Faunus stowaway from the incoming ship, creates a scene and runs past them while being chased by the police officers and the team follows suit, but Weiss collides into a girl named Penny. She introduces herself and says she is planning to participate in the combat tournament. Her odd behavior puts off the girls, and Weiss questions her ability. Afterwards, Weiss remains motivated to find the \"filthy Faunus rapscallion\", but her attitude offends Blake. Their argument resumes and continues into the evening, even after they get back to their dorm room. Weiss then explains that the violence against her family's company is the source of her distrust and hostility. In the heat of their arguing, Blake accidentally lets slip her association with the White Fang. Fearful, she quickly dashes out of the room and goes to Beacon's courtyard. Staring at the statues, she removes her bow to reveal a pair of cat ears. In the day, the team are seen looking for Blake, who is revealed to be with Sun Wukong.",
