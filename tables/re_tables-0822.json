It is revealed that Vega's employer is supposed to come watch the final with Phoenix himself, so the Pirates and the Flux Committee set up a trap to try and capture him. Rocket and Tia return to Akillian before the championship so Rocket can regain his strength. The championship begins. The teams battle to a 1:1 Halftime score. A robotic cat approaches Magnus Blade. A hologram of Harris comes out and thanks Magnus Blade (Lord Phoenix) for playing right into his trap. He now has enough multi-flux to destroy the universe, and Paradisia will be the first to fall. The pirates pursue the cat, leading to a rematch between Vega and Sonny. Massive earthquakes begin to rock Paradisia's surface.

This means Lun-Zia must learn the Breath, Mei must learn the Smog, and Yuki must learn the Wave. The practices are made more and more intense as Aarch enters the holostadium to show how the breath can make him strong enough to defeat The Snow Kids since he knows all their moves. Special Breath training is given to Rocket, Tia, and Ahito to allow them to become faster by relaying on the Breath instead of their own skills. After learning the Smog, Mei decides she can't tolerate the sickness it will cause and decides to depart back for Akillian. Before leaving, Mei visits D'Jok, who has started up football classes for young kids in the Genesis Forest. D'Jok says he will never return after betraying the Snow Kids, but he wishes Mei the best. Lun-Zia tries to master the breath, but she can't get past her native Flux.

The Snow Kids are declared to be the greatest champions ever as they';ve become the first team to win the cup 3 times in a row. A few months later Aarch and Artegor agree to become coaches for the next generation, the kids training at Club Galactik. It is revealed that Aarch and Adium are now married, and Adium is pregnant. Mice Delight has been declared to be a technoid drink not intended for organic consumption, and it has become a great success. As Clamp takes the Snow Kids and the Galactik Kids into the new holo-trainer, a mysterious light surrounds it and causes them all to scream. Clamp deactivates the holo-trainer, but all the Galactik kids, Mei, and Micro-Ice have disappeared. A strange energy with their screams is shown taken into space, leaving a major cliff hanger for the season finale."

A disturbing late-night message from his estranged brother Roy leads DCI Banks to go in search of him, without telling anyone. Meanwhile, DI Morton quickly alienates her colleagues with her tactless style at a murder scene, then makes matters worse by finding evidence linking Banks to the dead woman and speculating he could be a suspect.

When Alan breaks the news to his parents that Roy has been murdered, they plead with him to find their son's killer.

DCI Banks is instantly struck by the way the victim's family has responded to the shocking event. Evidence reveals Rothwell has been living a double life, and Banks and DI Helen Morton work together tentatively to investigate the murder of a mysterious victim with two identities. Possible links to a money-laundering operation plunge them into a high-profile fraud investigation with political ramifications. Alan's friend, Pamela Jefferies lies in a coma following a vicious attack, and Banks becomes even more determined to find Rothwell's killer. Against orders, he questions MP Martin Fleming, which puts him on a collision course with his former rival DCI Burgess. Meanwhile, DI Morton pursues another suspect and puts pressure on Rothwell's family.",

While he and Justin have an on-and-off-again relationship, Justin is the only one of his sexual encounters that Brian finds himself falling in love with and the only one he continues to have sex with after the first night. He makes his living as an advertising executive for Vangard, and later on builds his own company, Kinnetik, which was named by Justin. While he purports himself as not part of the gay and lesbian community, he will do what he can to protect his fellow gay man or woman. His motto when it comes to straight people: \"There are two kinds of straight people in the world, those that hate you to your face and those who hate you behind your back.\""

        "Justin loses his virginity to Brian at the age of seventeen and falls in love with him. He runs away from home after coming out of the closet, primarily because his father is not accepting of his sexuality. Nicknamed \"Sunshine\" by Debbie because of his bright smile and cheery disposition, Justin is queer-bashed at the end of Season 1, resulting in Brian taking him in during Season 2. A talented artist, Justin briefly contemplates attending business school to appease his father but ultimately decides to attend art school to become a visual artist. He and Brian further their relationship over the five seasons eventually ending in a marriage proposal. Justin says yes, but Brian tells him to go to New York to pursue his art because he would be more successful there than he would be in Pittsburgh."
