        "A crisis in Haiti takes much of the President and Leo's time, while the senior staff are planning the announcement of the President's MS. The democratically-elected new Haitian President is facing a military coup and the U.S. finds itself in the middle of the storm when a U.S. diplomat smuggles the new President into the safety of the U.S. Embassy in Port-au-Prince. An evacuation operation turns deadly when U.S. soldiers shoot and kill several rebel Haitians who tried to stop a plane from taking off at the airport. Donna is told by Toby about the President's condition. The staff considers how to deal with the bad news of a poll by Joey Lucas that reveals voters have hugely negative reactions to the possibility of a politician having a potentially fatal disease and then covering it up. They consider what kind of media reveal to have and what the future might hold for all of them. The President agrees with Leo that he should have a discussion with the staff about whether or not to seek reelection. Josh follows up on his previous week's discovery that a Congressional lawsuit against major tobacco companies is running into funding problems. Two Congressmen, a Republican and a Democrat, receive no such contributions but do not like the case's legal merits. Josh is then furious and plans to publicly embarrass the two Congressmen to get the funds unlocked. In a brief conversation with Mrs. Landingham, directly before she goes to collect her new car, the President says he'd like to have a word with her on her return. It is later revealed that she was killed in a car crash that occurred at 18th and Potomac-adjacent the main entrance to the Congressional Cemetery.",

        "After destroying several GHQ Endlaves, Shu, Inori and the Undertakers are forced to retreat when an advanced Endlave joins the battle, ridden by 2nd Lieutenant Daryl Yan. After regrouping with the others, Gai commends his hacker Tsugumi and Endlave pilot Ayase Shinomiya but scolds Inori for allowing Shu to absorb the Void Genome since he had intended to use it. Nevertheless, Gai states that with the power Shu now has, he can no longer stand idly by. Later, Funeral Parlor proceeds to stop Guin who took an group of innocent civilians hostage. While Daryl and several soldiers execute some of them, Funeral Parlor launches an attack and tricks Daryl to drive his Endlave away from Guin's command center. Gai then reveals himself and has a standoff with Guin and his men, all pointing their weapons at him. Using the stand off as a diversion, Shu heads to the mobile post holding Daryl's cockpit and extracts his Void; a weapon called Kaleidoscope. As the standoff reaches its climax, Guin orders his men to fire at Gai. Just then, Shu uses the Kaleidoscope to shield Gai and deflect the lasers back at Guin and his men, annihilating them. In the aftermath, despite witnessing the atrocities the GHQ are responsible for and what the Undertakers stand for, Shu declines Gai's offer to join them. The next day, much to Shu's surprise, Inori transfers into his school.",

On the day of trial, Shu has a mock battle with Ayase's Endlave Steiner where the goal is to get past and into the vehicle behind it. Shu succeeds the task after using Arugo's Void a flashlight that brings darkness to blind Ayase and pass the trail at. Just as Kenji arrives, and speaks of something akin to Shu's potential of betrayal, they receive a troubling report from Tsugumi. Gai earlier led a team to intercept the arrival of mercenaries and Endlaves at an airport and confiscate their supplies but their position was attacked by the Leukocyte, an orbital satellite laser."

        "As Shu returns to school following his GHQ arrest, he is met by rumors having spread in his absence. However with a cover story prepared by the student council president, Arisa Kuohouin, he is warmly welcomed back by his classmates. Shu also learns from Hare Menjou and Souta Tamadate that Yahiro didn't return to school since his arrest. Later, Shu's mother Haruka returns home and welcomes Inori without much question. Meanwhile, Funeral Parlor begins running out of supplies and Gai initiates a plan to acquire a new supply route. The following night, Arisa and her grandfather, Okina Kuhouin, the head of the Kuhouin Group attend a party on a cruise ship whilst GHQ's Colonel Eagleman begins a plan to attack the ship with Daryl, Segai and Rowan following intelligence that the Kuhouin Group plans to make a business deal with an international party outside of Japan. As Funeral Parlor's operation begins, Shu and Gai sneak on board and Gai briefly has an exchange with Arisa, making an analogy to the social shields she puts up before he proposes a deal to Okina. At the same time, Tsugumi informs them of Eagleman's plan to attack the ship with missiles. In order to save the ship and its passengers, Gai tricks Arisa into coming to the upper deck where Shu extracts her Void and uses it to defend from the onslaught of missiles. After the operation, Okina, having witnessed Gai and Shu (Funeral Parlor) defending them from the GHQ speaks with Shinbugi and agrees to help supplies get to Funeral Parlor. Shinbugi remarks on Gai's cunning by being the one who informed Eagleman of the Kuhouin Group's deal in the first place, setting the stage for the attack and ultimately their partnership. Before leaving the ship, Gai tells Arisa that despite her toughened exterior, she is shy to the doting of others. As Shu and Inori leave for school the next day, Shu admits that for the first time he is glad for the power he possesses. Finally Haruka, after seeing Shu and Inori off, looks at an old photo of herself, Shu and the mysterious girl from his memories, remarking that they have to protect him.",

As Gai leaves for a week, Hare and Kanon begin speaking about Shu's changed in personality, making him more open to others. As Shu arrives in class after school, Kanon makes an excuse and leaves so Hare and Shu can go shopping together alone. Elsewhere, Major General Yan questions Haruka and Keido about the disappearance of the meteor fragment from the vault at Oshima. While on the train, Hare almost confesses to Shu but is inadvertently stopped when Yahiro bursts in, escaping some drug addicts. Shu then parts with Hare since he takes the opportunity to speak with Yahiro. While they talk, Yahiro reveals that after the incident at the Isolation Ward, he escaped with Jun and went into hiding.

The viral Endlave then proceeds to attack Yahiro and Shu stabs it with the shears causing him to enter Jun's memories of Jun and Yahiro's past before Lost Christmas. Jun tells Shu that the virus enabled him to see Voids and the darkness of people's hearts. He saw that even though Yahiro both loves and hates him because of the burden he is. Jun then begs Shu to use Yahiro's Void, that which severs life, to kill him while he still has fond memories of Yahiro. Shu is reluctant but as the Endlave begins crushing Yahiro he severs Jun's life thread, killing him. Afterwards, as Yahiro awakens and asks for Jun, Shu says he killed him to Yahiro's horror unaware that they were followed by Hare.",

A large number of teenage refugees is sent to Tennouzu High, which has been set up as a shelter. Unable to find the rest of the Funeral Parlor members, Shu, Inori, Tsugumi and Ayase stay at Tennouzu High. However, Ayase is mourning over Gai's death and blames Shu and Tsugumi from preventing her to fight to the death in order to protect Gai. Due to tensions among the teenage refugees, the Student Council decides to hold a school festival to relieve stress. At the same time, Shu learns that his powers have evolved, enabling him to extract Voids from people without rendering them unconscious. Meanwhile, Segai has taken over the Anti Bodies and sends Daryl undercover to spy at Tennouzu High. As the students prepare the festival, a group of disgruntled refugees prepare to attack the school with a Humvee and Endlave provided by Segai. With the festival going well, Inori is finalizing her preparations to sing on stage. However, the disgruntled refugees attack. Shu tries bring Ayase to safety, but Ayase scolds him for treating her with pity. Ayase is frustrated that she can only control Endlaves, and is never able to help in any other way due to her inability to walk. She asks Shu for help, and he does so by extracting her Void: the Paraplegic's Shoes (Leg Prosthesis) a pair of leg braces that allow her to rapidly skate over ground, as well as jump with incredible power. Both Ayase and Shu stop the disgruntled refugees. With the attack over, Inori sings to the crowd. Shortly after, Souta manages to get a TV signal, and so displays it on the stage's screen. Much to everyone's shock, Shuichiro is revealed to be alive and in command of the Japanese provincial government as president. He announces that \"Loop 7\", the area where Tennouzu High is also located is to be sealed off for the next ten years, claiming there are no survivors.",

However, the situation starts to deteriorate as the blockade draws closer and the supply of vaccines starts running low. Rumors about Yahiro's plan to prioritize the survival of those with stronger Voids with a Void Ranking system create turmoil among the students, despite Shu being opposed to the idea. Meanwhile Hare is encouraged by Tsugumi to confess her feeling to him, but at the sight of a troubled Shu who is questioning his leadership, she refrains herself and comforts him instead, telling he is a kind \"King\". Later, Shu is approached by Souta and other students with weaker voids who are afraid of being left behind and asks him to let them use their voids for training. Shu complies, but learns that they left the school to look for supplies instead and he rushes to help them with his friends.

Taking her into his arms, he is horrified when the Apocalypse Virus crystallizes, then destroys, her body. An enraged Shu draws Inori's void by force and destroys Daryl's forces with ease. Blaming Souta for Hare's death, Shu vents his rage by beating him and declares that he will implement the Void Ranking system and become an ruthless king, something Hare didn't want him to become.",

Blaming Souta for Hare's death, Shu vents his rage by beating him and declares that he will implement the Void Ranking system and become an ruthless king, something Hare didn't want him to become."

        "As the combine forces of the Undertakers and the UN forces arrive at GHQ Headquarters, realizing the 256 Leukocyte satellites was a bluff, Shu helps Ayase into her new Steiner Endlave and promises his friends and allies that they will rescue Inori and stop Gai. As the UN forces attack, Gai uses Yuu, Kenji and Arisa voids to decimate them and Shuichiro orders the GHQ/Anti Bodies/Daath forces to destroy them. Daryl is forced to join the attack in his new Gespenst Endlave due to having his void taken. Thanks to Tsugumi's void, Shu and his Undertakers/PMC allies manage to sneak inside and hack into the base system, allowing the UN the chance to counterattack. As Tsugumi group split up with Shu and the others, Gai prepares to get rid of Inori's memories before Mana can take over her body but ask her why she loves Shu. Inori answers while she is grateful that Gai rescued her from the lab she was created and gave her a purpose in life, Shu showed her the ugliness and beauty in life and how hard he to amend his mistakes that made her love him. As crystals take over her body, Inori sings a song that only Shu can hear who leads them to the center of GHQ Headquarters. Shu is separated from his allies as Yuu confronts Shu himself while Kurachi, Haruka, Ayase, Argo and the rest faces off with Daryl and his men. Yuu reveals that he is actually an embodiment of the will of the Daath organization, and impressed on how far Shu has done, offers him to become the new \"Adam\" and become Mana's mate which Shu refuses, leading them to fight. As Yuu uses his followers void to try and kill Shu, Yuu laments how Shu squander his chance to restart the human race all for a \"doll\", but Shu counters back, telling him Inori is not a tool but a human being who was there when he was down and he will rescue her. Defeated, Yuu allows Shu to meet Inori before disappearing. Shu confronts Gai who reveals Inori has finally transformed into Mana."

        "After Mana is completely resurrected, Mana greets Shu but is shunned by him after she speaks ill of Inori, much to her anger. Gai draws out Mana's Void to fight Shu while she triggers the Fourth Apocalypse, spreading the Apocalypse virus throughout the entire world. Haruka confronts Shuichiro who commits suicide by injecting the virus into himself while admitting defeat. Meanwhile the Undertakers fight a group of Endlaves led by Daryl, who believes he changed because of them and wants to go back to his old self. Tsugumi finds that her attempts to hack the GHQ system are being repelled by another hacker as skilled as her. Shibungi figures that the hacker is actually Kenji and after tracking his location, he kills him, allowing Tsugumi to operate freely and help Ayase defeat Daryl. Just when Shu is about to be killed by Gai, Shu sees a flower while hearing Inori's voice. With his last strength, he pulls out the Inori's void from the Flower and rushes to Gai. Gai then is defeated by Shu as he sees Inori's soul, allowing Shu to make the finishing blow. Before dying, Gai reveals that his actions were needed, so that Mana can start the Fourth Apocalypse so she would finally be able to rest, otherwise she would always be resurrected by Daath. Having recovered the Void Genome Gai stole from him and Inori, Shu makes use of its power to eliminate the virus from the world for good and stop the Fourth Apocalypse by sacrificing himself by summoning his own Void which he uses to draw the Voids of everyone in the surrounding city to cure them of the Apocalypse virus by taking on all the virus by himself. As Shu finally becomes consumed by the virus, Inori sacrifices herself to save Shu's life, while Haruka, Kurachi, Arisa, Daryl and the rest of the Undertakers manage to escape the GHQ building before it collapses. Some years later, Tokyo is finally rebuilt and Shu, now blind and his severed arm replaced by a mechanical prosthetic limb, celebrates Hare's birthday with Ayase, Tsugumi, Yahiro, Kanon and Souta. It ends with Shu sitting on a bench beside a lake to hear one of Inori's songs while reminiscing about his days with her.",
