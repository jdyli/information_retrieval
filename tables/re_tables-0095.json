A year later, it was discovered that Frank had also cheated on Jenny with Jenny's sister, Rosa. This was due to the realization that Rosa's daughter Peggy had been fathered by Frank and not Frank's brother, Luc, as it had been originally thought. A year later, Frank married Simonne. They had one child together, Franky. They separated in 2006, after which he disappeared due to a series of murders his German doppelganger committed. He was thereafter assumed dead, but was then shown to be alive. Frank wasn't welcome in his former home and found himself a flat together with his best mate Cois Pelckmans. By this point Simonne had started dating Mo Fawzi while Frank left. Frank and Simonne signed the divorce papers in the last episode of season 12, they kissed, so there was hope they would get back together. Although a few days later, he would officially get together with Julia Snackaert, n\u00e9e Van Capelle. This romance didn't last long due to Frank being in love with Simonne. After being fired from Marie Design by his own brother Luc, he found himself a new job at Leo's taxi company. He quits the job when it turns out Leo got a relationship with Jenny. Frank and Waldek start a new business as handymen. Later on, they start brewing beer together with David, Geert and Eddy. Initially, the brewery was a success but as David was set aside the knowledge was gone and they were forced to sell the it. The handymen business was neither a financial success, so Frank returned to Sanitechniek. Together with Eddy he set up a swindle: they installed fake materials and sold the genuine ones on the internet. One day, such boiler is placed at the Bed & Breakfast. Some days later, an unconscious Jana is foud in the bathroom who loses her unborn baby. Frank and Luc agree they were not aware of the swindle and only Eddy was involved."

        "She is mother to Ann and Tom. When the serie started, Marianne was already ex of Walter De Decker and lived on the other side of Belgium. She visited Walter frequent and acted as she still was \"the wife of a doctor\". After Walter died, she inherited his house. Marianne is a supercilious, arrogant busybody who thinks her actions are always the only correct ones. Due to her personalities, she does not have many friends. She found love again with Jean-Pierre De Ruyter, but after Leontien managed to seduce him, their relationship was over. She was shocked when daughter Ann was in a relationship with Jean-Pierre afterward. She found love in 2005 with Walter Frans and Robert Swerts. She had to choose between the two man and chose Swerts, a lawyer. It turned out Swerts was the serial murderer and raper, who was searched for an entire season. She then was supported by Walter, but they broke up after she couldn't hide her jealousy of his ex Betty Van Ginderen. Marianne is now married with Geert, a rather boring person. She has a vendetta with Rosa as last one got a family jewelry and a chalet as inheritance from Walter. Marianne was convinced she should get all the heritage and demanded Marianne to hand over the jewelry and chalet (but Rosa refused). As revenge, Marianne bought the house where Rosa lived and worked (a hair dressing saloon) and refused to give Rosa a new hiring contract. Marianne did a same thing when she bought \"Ter Smissen\" over from the family Sevenans. Her first act was the firing of Rosa. Until then, Marianne was good befriended with Jenny. This stopped when Marianne appointed Jenny as concessionaire of \"Ter Smissen\" and last one hired Rosa into her staff. Nowadays, Marianne is always in a happy mood when Rosa and Jenny are in a miserable situation. She and her son Tom tried to kidnap Robin, the child of Bianca (of whom Tom is the father) in Morocco, but Peggy discovered this and informed the police. After hotel Ter Smissen was partially destroyed in a fire, she is accused as responsible person as she did not change the electricity wires although Jenny informed her about the bad infrastructure. She falls in love with David Magiels, the father of Mayra. When Geert discovers the affaire he wants to divorce and quits the medical practice. After Lynn accused Tom to be her raper, Marianne tried to appease Lynn with money. She refuses. However, Ivo Courtois claims he can stop the accusation on condition Marianne marries him."

This was relocated to a new, dedicated office and an emphasis on student involvement led to the establishment of a permanent (annual) student writing team. The newsletter (renamed DiSH) seeks to be relevant and interesting to the students of the school, and the balance of content has shifted away from academic department news towards a magazine that is opinionated, nationalist and in which pictures are integral. Partly flowing from this change, in 2007 the school followed the lead of many other education establishments and created their first official Yearbook. This included photos of the current Year 11 students from the time when they entered the school and a written and photographic record of trips and awards that the departing students had made and gained."

It's a four-way tug-of-war with Lupin, the Jaguar gang, the Tatsumaki gang, and even Zenigata getting in on the act! And lest we forget, an upset by Fujiko. What effect will that have on the outcome?!"
