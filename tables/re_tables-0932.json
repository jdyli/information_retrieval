Romeo's route takes him to a church at which he is charged with ringing the bells every morning; the interim between ringing the bells to just before he races off again with his compensation makes it evident that a festival is to take place in town later on during the day whose central event Hero's Tree Climb is quite a point of contention with Romeo's childhood friend Anita who fears for his safety. The town festival obfuscates the reality that things are not going well in Romeo's village because of the long-standing drought that threatens the town's crops along with the micro-economy of Romeo's father Roberto; further inflaming matters is the arrival of Death God Luini looking for an opportunity to buy at least one of the local children. Galvanized by the carelessly discussed data about Roberto's outstanding debt to Mr. Scara, Death God Luini literally ignites his plan to arrogate the choice away from Roberto; even though as Romeo is the last man on the tree during the Hero's Tree Climb in spite of Embellino's treachery, he ultimately finds that the inferno is the least of his worries when it becomes apparent that the parched cornfields hide an arcane prologue about his origins that is the genesis of an epic adventure!!!"

For the purposes of this article, the OP vessel is considered the heavier and more oceanic role, with significantly more range or endurance, drawing the line arbitrarily at a displacement of roughly 200 tonnes vs. the CP. Nevertheless, many CP vessels are capable of oceanic navigation within reason, and OP vessels are also routinely used in coastal patrol missions."
