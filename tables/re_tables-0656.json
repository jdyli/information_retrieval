        "Yuxiang bribes 4D to pose as a robber so as to frighten Shanguo into moving, but he fails. Shanguo tells her that he'd rather die with his money than give up his $4,000,000. As one of Jinyin's mahjong kakis, Big Mouth Gang, was late to arrive at her mahjong session, they start with Qiaomei instead and she surprises them with her mahjong skills, despite claiming to not know anything about the game. Aimei dirties her pants and returns home to shower, only to be peeped at by Big Mouth Gang when she drops her towel. Her scream is heard at Jinyin's house, but Qiaomei dismisses it as a small matter, saying that her granddaughters scream several times a day. When she arrives home, Qiaomei asks Aimei about what had happened and Aimei tells her that she no longer has the will to live. Qiaomei tries to comfort her by telling her that she had to strip (in front of a doctor) before, only to be chided by Yuxiang.",
