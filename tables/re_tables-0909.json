Things remain awkward as Aria gives Ezra the cold shoulder. When Aria finally considers reconciling and visits Ezra's apartment, their relationship worsens when Ezra admits that he was still in love with his ex, Jackie, when he and Aria first met. After an awkward encounter Aria leaves early only to be greeted by a text from A. The picture attached has been taken of the inside of Ezra's apartment and cryptically asks what's missing. Aria realizes that the spare key usually found under the doormat is missing. Lucas brings Caleb back to Rosewood for Hanna but she's too hurt to take him back. Caleb explains that he wrote her a letter and gave it to Mona, who threw it away. Hanna confronts Mona about the letter, but leaves when she realizes to her shock that Noel Khan and Mona are dating. Emily is struggling to deal with her impending move to Texas and losing her friends, including Toby, who she re-bonds with as they wait for Spencer to join them in secret. Spencer then cancels as she is having some difficulties with family at home: Melissa, distraught over her missing husband, Ian, threatens not to let Spencer anywhere near the baby.

The girls freak out and leave before they can tell Dr. Anne their secrets. Dr. Anne later contacts the girls' parents and recommends that they take some time apart due to their \"unstable\" behavior during their last therapy session, meaning that the girls aren't allowed to see each other for a while. After Spencer finds a text message on Melissa's phone, she suspects that the caller is Ian. She joins up with Aria, Hanna, and Emily, and they send a message back to the caller to determine whether it is Ian by asking what the name of his and Melissa's unborn baby is. When the caller answers correctly, the girls fear that Ian is still alive. The final scene shows someone, presumably A, in Emily's room deleting files of A's messages and the copy of the video.",

The Liars find that Jason Dilaurentis has moved back into Rosewood, with a very suspicious attitude. They think back to when Alison had broken into his room and find out a secret of his. Samara and Emily start to hang out, but Emily struggles with her family's impending move to Texas. However, when a college athletic scout approaches her after a swim meet, she sees an opportunity that could keep her in Rosewood. She tries to convince her parents that the athletic scout \"basically offered\" her a scholarship to college, but she has to have a record of continuity. When she asks for a formal letter of this offer, the scout tells her there's no guarantee she'll get it. Her mom tells Emily that someone has been breaking into everyone's houses stealing camping supplies. Hanna's father returns to town, but Hanna doesn't trust him after seeing him marry into a brand new family. Mona tries to get Hanna's forgiveness by talking to Aria for advice\u2014 but Aria tells her that she's not allowed to talk to Hanna, so Mona's on her own. Mona also asks Aria to pick a goodbye present for Ezra's last day, since she knows him better \"from the play.\" Aria continues to be in a rough patch with Ezra, especially when they have a date, but he has to miss it for a board meeting at his new school.

Spencer tries to find out what Jason is up to, only to be interrogated by Jason about Ian's apparent death. The Liars discuss the fact that the only evidence they had (on Emily's computer) has been deleted, and that now they need to stick together no matter how many lies they have to tell.",

Then, at the Hastings' residence, Spencer makes out with Toby in her kitchen. As soon as he leaves, she hears her dad on the phone with someone, yelling and specifically complaining that Jason is home. Spencer tries to strike up a conversation with her father, as he searches for an unhealthy nighttime snack. The Liars meet with Jessica for lunch shortly afterwards, despite their awkward reservations. She then presents the girls with presents, four high fashion dresses. However, the girls are uneasy, as they remember Alison having picked them out and trying them on in a flashback. But, that is precisely why Jessica asks the girls to model those dresses in the fashion show; she wants them to realize Ali\u2019s dream and pay tribute to her. Just before the show, Spencer hands Noel the disc Mona asked her to deliver to him, not needing to see what's on it. In the corner of the room, Jessica and Peter have an argument, the details of which Spencer doesn't catch. The fashion show starts, and the outfits do not disappoint. Then the tribute to Alison begins, with her image prominent on the runway screen and the girls walking the runway in her dresses. Suddenly, the image changes so as to make Alison look like the devil, with fire around and peeling black eyes. The screen flashes \"the bitch is dead,\" and the music changes from sentimental to hellish. Spencer runs to Noel to make him turn it off, but he claims he can't.

My Rules.\" Jason then offers Aria a ride home, and she accepts."

        "Spencer begins to suspect more and more about Jason after finding his broken hockey stick in her yard, and deciding that he was the one who stole the missing page in Alison's autopsy file. While spying on him in his front yard and seeing how protective he is over the shed in his yard, she and Emily decide to break in and see what is so mysterious in it. While in the shed, they find pictures of Aria while she is sleeping, and a box of cameras and spying equipment. This leads the girls to realizing that Jason is spying on Aria, and could be spying on all of them. Meanwhile, Emily is under a ton of pressure. First, A put steroids in her pain cream which caused her blood tests to show signs of human growth hormones. Hanna's mom allows Emily to have Samara and some of Samara's friends over for a small get together, and A forces Emily to give her phone number to one of Samara's friends, Zoey. A tells Emily that if she doesn't get Zoey's number, she will tell everyone that Emily is taking steroids. Samara's other friend catches Emily giving Zoey her number and then later tells Samara which ends Emily's relationship with her. Aria begins to have continuous dreams about Jason, which she feels is threatening her relationship with Ezra. She tries to spend more time with Ezra(she surprises him by making out in his office), but her dreams continue. Along with this, Aria is also trying to figure out why Mike is robbing houses. Later at the park, Jason kisses Aria, but she tells him she is already taken, leading Jason to think she's afraid of him. Hanna discovers that the man following Caleb is not a police man, but instead a private investigator hired by his birth mother to find him. Caleb receives her phone number and is not sure whether to call her or not. However, Hanna convinces him that he should call his mother since the story of what happened to her and why she left Caleb have been torturing Caleb for twelve years. Caleb calls his mother and has a heartfelt phone conversation with her, leading him to leave Rosewood and go to California to see her. However, he notes that he will come back soon; after Caleb's departure Hanna calls her father and tells him that she will be a bridesmaid for his wedding and show up for the fitting. Spencer and Emily return to Jason's shed, only to find that he has discovered someone was in it and he has removed everything in it and only left the flashlight they dropped before. In the final scene, we see A developing a photograph of Spencer and Emily entering Jason's shed in Jason's darkroom. The Liars focus in on Jason, in more ways than one.",

Spencer suggests calling Caleb to help them recover information from the phone, but Hanna doesn't want to get him involved. While Caleb downloads the information on the computer from the phone, the owner shuts the phone down. Caleb works on decrypting the files on his laptop at school, which concerns Hanna. Spencer approaches Emily, hoping to enlist her help in snooping around Jason's house, believing him to be Garrett and Jenna's lackey. Emily starts community service at the crisis hotline that afternoon, Aria is on lockdown and Hanna is unhappy with Spencer for dragging Caleb into their \"A\" investigation. Emily suggests Spencer let Hanna use her lake house for face time with Caleb. At Hanna's house, Hanna tries to study while Lucas seems distracted. She gets a text from Spencer offering her the lake house. She gets the brilliant idea to use it to throw Caleb a surprise birthday party and enlists Lucas' help in planning it. Lucas reluctantly agrees to help. Emily attends her first training session at the crisis hotline center. She roleplays with the supervisor, reading the transcript of a call that came in last night aloud. While reading it, Emily realizes the caller seems likely to be the person who tried to kill her in the greenhouse last night; \"A's\" helper. Emily shows Spencer and Aria the transcript she swiped from the crisis center (Hanna already saw it). At the crisis center, Emily's supervisor tells her to listen in on the call that just came in because it is the transcript caller calling back. He says he is in way too deep and doesn't want to have to hurt anyone. Spencer and Emily listen together and recognize the caller's voice as Lucas'. Spencer and Hanna look for tiki torches in the attic of the lake house. Spencer discovers that the wallpaper in the background of the doll photo is the same as the panel on the attic wall. \"A\" has been in her attic. Emily answers a call at the crisis center. This time she speaks to Lucas who discloses he has to take care of his problem tonight and how hard it will be to lose \"her\" then heads straight to the party, fearing for Hanna. At the party, Spencer tells Hanna what she discovered in the attic, but Hanna is distracted with her tasks. Spencer and Emily learn from Mona that Hanna took the rowboat out with Lucas to set up the fireworks across the lake. Halfway across the lake, Lucas stops rowing. She becomes more and more frightened by Lucas' tone and asks to go back, hearing Spencer calling her name from shore. Lucas stands and shouts at her. Hanna flips, pushes him overboard, and takes the oars. She doesn't get far before a hand latches onto one of the oars and Hanna falls overboard. Spencer continues calling her name and directs Emily to go inside and call the police. Other partygoers gather around Spencer, curious about the situation. After a few tense moments, Hanna swims to shore. Spencer tries to warm Hanna up and find out what happened. Caleb arrives and Hanna mumbles \"surprise.\"",

Emily suggests Spencer let Hanna use her lake house for face time with Caleb. At Hanna's house, Hanna tries to study while Lucas seems distracted. She gets a text from Spencer offering her the lake house. She gets the brilliant idea to use it to throw Caleb a surprise birthday party and enlists Lucas' help in planning it. Lucas reluctantly agrees to help. Emily attends her first training session at the crisis hotline center. She roleplays with the supervisor, reading the transcript of a call that came in last night aloud.

At the crisis center, Emily's supervisor tells her to listen in on the call that just came in because it is the transcript caller calling back.

Hanna flips, pushes him overboard, and takes the oars. She doesn't get far before a hand latches onto one of the oars and Hanna falls overboard.

        "Hanna is certain that Lucas is still alive and out there. Spencer finds an old receipt in her lake house attic, sure that A was up there. The date on the receipt is around the time Hanna and Caleb got to Spencer's lake house; the receipt shows an address in Philadelphia, which Aria and Spencer agree to visit. At school, Aria confesses to Spencer that her mom thinks she made a date with Holden when she really called Ezra. Ezra tells her that she can't call him anymore. Holden asks Aria out despite her being grounded. Mona complains to a dejected and preoccupied Hanna about losing Noel. They have a row over Hanna's inattentiveness whenever Mona confesses to Hanna. Hanna runs to the bathroom and starts crying, but quiets when someone else enters. After a while Hanna suddenly notices the sink is overflowing and a small boat is floating in the sink. A piece of paper in it says \"Life is but a dream, Hanna. And I'm your worst nightmare. -A\" Aria buys tickets for a play for her and Holden's date, which was where Ezra was going to take Aria a while ago, just to see Ezra. Hanna argues with Caleb when Caleb wants to go look for Lucas but she doesn't want to. In Philly, Spencer notices a rehab center for the blind near the address on the receipt. This was where Jenna used to go before moving back to Rosewood. Spencer goes in to ask about Jenna, and notices Garrett checked Jenna out of the rehab center the night after Ali died, and never checked back in. She has a conversation with another patient; Spencer claims she knew Jenna before she moved to Rosewood. The patient was inspired by how determined Jenna was; he says maybe she was motivated to get out of here. Spencer steals the patient logbook from which the year Jenna was there, and leaves after pretending to sign-in. Aria meets Holden outside the theater, and finally is able to see Ezra. Aria and Holden are informed that Ezra left the play early, to Aria's sadness. Holden figures out that Aria and Ezra have a relationship, and understands this because he hides stuff from his parents too. Maya reveals to Emily that while she was at \"sober camp\", she hooked up with a guy, and Emily is unstirred. Hanna notices the door's latch is broken, but really Lucas broke into her house. Hanna encounters Lucas, and Lucas tells her he never wanted to hurt her. Caleb shows up and asks where Lucas was. Lucas reveals he was on the crisis hotline because he lost Caleb's money in a bet. He was missing because he drove around all night selling his comic books to get the money back, and he took Hanna out onto the lake to ask her to soften the blow of the news for Caleb. They are on good terms again, but Hanna questions who they met in the greenhouse. Hanna reveals this to the other girls, and Spencer shows them the sign-in book. Instead of their Chinese food, they find live earthworms and dirt, followed by A's text. At the end of the episode, A is seen loosening the hinges on some unknown scaffolding.",

He was missing because he drove around all night selling his comic books to get the money back, and he took Hanna out onto the lake to ask her to soften the blow of the news for Caleb.

        "Hanna is certain that Lucas is still alive and out there. Spencer finds an old receipt in her lake house attic, sure that A was up there. The date on the receipt is around the time Hanna and Caleb got to Spencer's lake house; the receipt shows an address in Philadelphia, which Aria and Spencer agree to visit. At school, Aria confesses to Spencer that her mom thinks she made a date with Holden when she really called Ezra. Ezra tells her that she can't call him anymore. Holden asks Aria out despite her being grounded. Mona complains to a dejected and preoccupied Hanna about losing Noel. They have a row over Hanna's inattentiveness whenever Mona confesses to Hanna. Hanna runs to the bathroom and starts crying, but quiets when someone else enters. After a while Hanna suddenly notices the sink is overflowing and a small boat is floating in the sink. A piece of paper in it says \"Life is but a dream, Hanna. And I'm your worst nightmare. -A\" Aria buys tickets for a play for her and Holden's date, which was where Ezra was going to take Aria a while ago, just to see Ezra. Hanna argues with Caleb when Caleb wants to go look for Lucas but she doesn't want to. In Philly, Spencer notices a rehab center for the blind near the address on the receipt. This was where Jenna used to go before moving back to Rosewood. Spencer goes in to ask about Jenna, and notices Garrett checked Jenna out of the rehab center the night after Ali died, and never checked back in. She has a conversation with another patient; Spencer claims she knew Jenna before she moved to Rosewood. The patient was inspired by how determined Jenna was; he says maybe she was motivated to get out of here. Spencer steals the patient logbook from which the year Jenna was there, and leaves after pretending to sign-in. Aria meets Holden outside the theater, and finally is able to see Ezra. Aria and Holden are informed that Ezra left the play early, to Aria's sadness. Holden figures out that Aria and Ezra have a relationship, and understands this because he hides stuff from his parents too. Maya reveals to Emily that while she was at \"sober camp\", she hooked up with a guy, and Emily is unstirred. Hanna notices the door's latch is broken, but really Lucas broke into her house.

Ian sets up a video camera, then Garrett leads Jenna into the room. Ian and Garrett argue over getting videos from Alison. Garrett finds Alison's wooden box, and the girls realize this was the night Alison was murdered. Toby calls Spencer, and she has Emily lie for her. Toby says Spencer's been \"confusing\" lately.

Caleb sees that Garrett is in the videos on A's phone. Hanna notices a piece of paper inside the dolls from the box. It is a series of threatening notes, one of them making reference to a pumpkin. The girls flash back to Halloween coming home with Alison after Noel's party. A jack-o-lantern on her front porch had a knife stuck in its head. There is a note from A, but Alison laughs it off as \"Jason's beer buddies\" and asks the girls to stay over. In present day, they realize the note that Alison got was one that said \"next time it'll be your face.\" Toby climbs the scaffolding, which is revealed to be at the Hastings' house.

He wants her to be safe and happy and wants her to make sure that being together is what she wants. They then go home.

Garrett says someone is hacking into the school's files and he traced it back to his IP address. In the computer lab, Caleb tells Hanna Garrett can't get past his firewall without his help and the files from A are all on flashdrives. Hanna fears someone did get into his laptop and put the evidence somewhere Caleb wouldn't find them. Hanna tells him to hack into his computer and delete the files. Aria finally finds out what Holden is doing on their \"dates\" - he is doing martial arts but his parents forbid as Holden has a heart condition. Spencer visits Jason where he tells her that he found another one of Ali's boxes under the floorboards at their grandma's house. There were love letters amongst others from Spencer's dad to Jason's mom, and $15,000. Spencer thinks Ali must have gotten the money by blackmailing Spencer's father after finding them. Later, The girls go to meet the man they agreed to see who had information about Alison's alter-ego Vivian. He says Vivian told him about a friend called Alison who was getting texts from somebody with a blocked number and she would pay to find out who. The man claims to have found out who, but told Vivian before she gave him the money, and got fired for accessing restricted info. When Aria asks what he knows, he says he wants what Vivian owes - $2,000. He leaves his number and his name, Jonah.

        "The cops tell Emily that Maya is missing, and that her parents don't know where she is. Rosewood high hosts a father daughter dance and the girls make plans for their dates. Byron and Aria's relationship is strained, Hanna's father is MIA so her mother offers to go with her, and Emily's father comes back from Texas to attend with her. Unfortunately he has to promptly leave after the dance because he's needed for army service. With fathers looking to make amends and daughters trying to keep the peace, the annual dance looks to be anything but fun. After Spencer tells Melissa that she saw her get into a car with Garrett, Melissa reveals some secrets to Spencer. Melissa tells her that Garrett was helping her as he was a close friend of Ian. She also reveals that she sent texts to Alison telling her to back off Ian, and when Spencer tells the rest of the girls, they are inclined to believe that Melissa is \"A\". Ashley continues her hunt to find answers about what is going on with Hanna with help from a surprising source, Detective Wilden. He demands that Ashley gets Hanna's phone if they want answers, but when Mona and Hanna catch them conversing in a car, Hanna gets angry at her mother. She drops her phone in the sink to prevent them from finding out anything about \"A\". Emily discovers, with help from her father, that Maya bought a ticket to San Francisco, but may not have gotten on the train. After she bought the ticket, she was seen outside of the station talking to someone in a dark car, and then she was gone.

Ali tells Spencer she's sorry about not telling her that Jason was her brother too, and that she's glad the girls \"haven't given up\". Ali also warns her not to miss what's right in front of her. Spencer wakes up to see the side door has been open all night. She sees two prescription bottles, and wonders if it was only a dream.

Spencer realizes that 'A' wasn't watching Ali; Ali was watching 'A'. Mona and her go back to the Lost Woods Resort, and Spencer realizes that Room One wasn't where they had too look- it was Room two. They open the door, gasping at what they see: A's Lair. It is plastered with pictures of the girls, and other things such as the voodoo doll Alison received, the creepy baby doll costume, and a doll set, each one looking like the girls with Alison sitting on the top. Spencer finds numerous things that point to Mona being 'A', and 'A' is finally revealed to be Mona Vanderwaal. She knocks Spencer out cold, and they take a drive. Aria video calls Spencer, and the girls see who 'A' is. They flee to catch up with them. Spencer jumps out of the car, and the girls arrive. Mona freaks out and tries to kill Spencer, but ends up falling off a cliff. The ambulance arrives, and so does Dr. Sullivan. She tells them 'A' threatened her son, which is why she left. It is then revealed Mona is alive. Meanwhile, we get a peek at what Mona is thinking while being kept in the mental hospital: She says that this is what \"they\" wanted, and their plan worked out just right. This means that Mona isn't the one pulling the strings; someone else is. A body is found, and it is Maya's. Emily cries while the girls comfort her. The final scene shows Mona in her hospital room.

Through Agent Harris, Sam then manages to get a meeting with the FBI deputy director, planning to take down Anson.
