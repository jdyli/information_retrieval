Then a strange little man appears claiming to be from the 5th dimension. He is Mxyzptlk . Superboy meets him and discovers that Mxy's magic can harm him just as it could anyone else. Mxy decides he wants to take Lana back with him. Using his magic, he impersonates Clark and tries to get together with Lana. When Lana resists Mxy's twisted version of Clark, Mxy uses his magic to make her want to come with him. She is preparing to leave with Mxy when T.J., Superboy, and a scientist discover that the totem held back magical spirits. Once the totem was moved, the doorway to our world was opened. They also learn that saying his name backward will cause the imp to return to his own dimension for 90 days. Knowing this, Superboy gives Lana a going away speech that he will record on video tape. She begins to read and Mxy takes over. Not realizing what he's reading, he reads his name backward aloud and vanishes. Lana returns to normal and everything done while Mxy was here is automatically undone.",

They discover a dangerous android and are narrowly saved from death by Superboy. T.J. had taken pictures of the machine and the leader of the project took it, so T.J. returns to the project to get more shots. He is captured so that the android can undergo a final test against Superboy. Superboy arrives to save him, and discovers that the android's creator has his own secret. He too is an android from another world who created the other android to be his killing machine, since he was programmed never to kill. He is badly damaged in Superboy's battle and a self-destruct program is initiated. Superboy flies him away as he explodes.",

Lipcott awakens inside the ship, which is actually a time machine, with two mutant men and a normal woman, Vora. The mutants want plutonium. They reveal that they are from the 24th century and that they need plutonium to fight their enemies since no more exists in their time. TJ and Clark begin to investigate the kidnapping. TJ is taken by the mutant time travelers. Vora is sent to find Superboy so he can help them break into the installation where the plutonium is stored. Vora reveals to Superboy that she herself is a mutant in her society since everyone else has been mutated by fallout over the years. Superboy agrees to help in order to save TJ and Lipcott. Superboy gets the plutonium and flees with it. When the mutants blast him, he reflects their laser beams back at them and captures them. Vora frees Lipcott and TJ.

He is the father of Jamalul Kiram III and Ismael Kiram II. Punjungan was the Crown Prince regent of Sultan Esmail Kiram I. under the condition to transfer his rights to the son of the Sultan, when he is of legal age,this condition rarely prevailed as the law of succession will be tainted by the rest of previous hierarchy to also do the same backward succession which is not prescribed by the law of succession. The Primogeniture law of succession will only takes place to the last male heir successor.Since Punjungan Kiram is the youngest brother of Sultan Esmail KIram I,the hierarchy goes down to his oldest son Jamallul KIram III and his legitimate Rajah Muda . Instead of resigning from his position, Punjungan exiled himself in Malaysia and later returned to contest the reign of Mahakutta Kiram, who had lawfully replaced him as Crown Prince. Mahakuttah Kiram was politically proclaimed by President Marcos as Sultan based on Abraham Rasul recommendation, but later retracted by President Ferdinand Marcos after carefully found out that the Sabah legal heir is Punjungan Kiram under Mackaskie ruling of 1939."

        "Gingka has a nightmare that he is fighting Ryuga again, but he is still as powerless as before, and he has to watch as his Storm Pegasus gets completely annihilated by Lightning L-Drago. He wakes up with a start, hand extended towards the window through which the sun is shining, as if to reach desperately for the remains of Pegasus. After a few seconds, he calms down and stares at the table beside him; he grabs Pegasus and lays back down on the couch to try to sleep some more. In the morning, Madoka, Kenta and Benkei notice that Gingka has not even touched the triple-beef burger and fries that were prepared for him. Together, they recall the latest events and reckon that Gingka is not the same anymore: he does not seem half as lively as he used to be. Unknown to them, Gingka listens to their conversation from the top of the stairs. Finally, he decides to come down and make his presence known by yelling at Benkei not to eat his burger, which he takes back from him. Then, Osamu, Takashi and, Akira enter the B-Pit and Osamu shows his Beyblade to Gingka. He would like to have a match with him because he thinks he stands a better chance now that he slightly improved his blade. With a weary smile, Gingka accepts his challenge. However, as they pronounce the countdown to the match, Gingka has a flash of Ryuga in front of him, instead of seeing Osamu. This vision makes him extremely nervous, which considerably weakens his launch. Osamu easily takes the win; his friends hesitantly congratulate him, almost saying that he is better than Gingka, but they are unable to believe Pegasus' performance. Benkei yells at them before they got to talk further, so they hurry outside. Gingka picks up his Beyblade and acts as if nothing important had happened, but Kenta obviously saw through his fake joy and he tries to get his friend to talk, yet he ends up leaving. Kyoya appears, leaning on a wall; he says Gingka needs time on his own. Kenta decides to follow Gingka to the riverside anyway, and he succeeds in getting him to open up by expressing how he hates seeing Gingka so helpless, and also almost insane, like at the end of his battle against Ryuga. Not too reluctantly, Gingka tells his story: On a beautiful day in his home village named Koma, Gingka wakes up to find that his father is not in the other bed beside his own. He gets up, dresses up, and walks out of the small house to the river nearby; he splashes some water on his face, then walks around the village to find his father. He asks a man who sells fish, as well as some kids who are playing Beyblade if they have seen him. Both their answers lead him to the forest, where he finally meets his father. However, a bear is tackling him and both are more or less wrestling, since Ryo simply smiles at his son, as if there was nothing wrong with the situation. As a matter of fact, he takes his launcher and blade out and destroys the branch that was stuck in the bear's back, and the latter walks away, not threatening at all anymore. Ryo gets back to the village with his son, where they both start Beyblading. Ryo gives Storm Pegasus to Gingka while he uses a random Bey, yet he still wins the game. However, they had fun battling, and Ryo reminds his son that this is all that matters in a match. Later, Gingka's father takes him to the ceremony they have to the Pegasus. At first, all of the villagers are just standing in front of the mountain dedicated to it but, upon their arrival, Ryo launches Storm Pegasus forward and it lights up all the torches atop the pillars that lead to the sanctuary inside the mountain, which is also a volcano. Storm Pegasus finishes its path by going up into the sky and, coincidentally, the Pegasus constellation becomes more visible. Everybody is overwhelmed by all of this. Shortly after though, a helicopter flies past them and lands right outside the entrance to the volcano. Ryo immediately knows that those invaders are dangerous, therefore he runs towards the mountain as well. Inside, Ryuga and Doji avoid all the traps set up against eventual intruders, such as arrows. Just beside the crystal that holds Lightning L-Drago, there is also a trap which could have impaled Ryuga, but he swiftly avoids it by sacrificing his white coat instead. Now in possession of the L-Drago, Ryuga breaks the crystal single-handedly while Ryo appears to attempt to stop them. At first, L-Drago's power seems to be too much for the white-haired BeyBlader to handle, but he soon gets addicted to its immense power. He shoots it onto one of the high rocks that slightly pave the lava underneath them. Lightning L-Drago sculpts the rock to make a Beystadium, and Ryo's Storm Pegasus meets it there. Both start a tough battle during which Ryuga appears to struggle with his new power still, but they quickly embrace each other and he makes a blinding attack that leaves Ryo lying on the ground, too weak to be capable to get back up. Ryo steps onto his rock, bends down, and rips off his Pegasus bandana, which he uses to clean his new Blade. While Ryo tries to stop him from leaving with Lightning L-Drago, Ryuga throws the bandana before him, yet Gingka's father is still unable to even pick it up. As rocks fall from the roof of the volcano, Doji and Ryuga exit with L-Drago, Doji having to support the other Blader with an arm around his shoulder. Gingka, who had been watching the whole battle and who can only stand on his own rock, screams with despair at his father, torn between the urgency of an exit and helping him. Unfortunately, there is no way Ryo could jump to safety, so all he does is send Storm Pegasus to Gingka, officially giving it to him. Gingka sadly watches his father reassuring him with a thumb up that everything is OK, while rocks keep falling, eventually forcing Gingka out of the mountain. Outside, he slides down to sit, resting his back against the volcano and he start to cry. As soon as the situation sinks in, he screams \"dad\", having just lost his only other family member. Back in the city, Kenta is crying from hearing this tragedy, and he understands why he hates Ryuga. However, they both agree to try to have fun anyway, but they will definitely try to make Ryuga pay for all he has done soon.",

Gingka, who had been watching the whole battle and who can only stand on his own rock, screams with despair at his father, torn between the urgency of an exit and helping him. Unfortunately, there is no way Ryo could jump to safety, so all he does is send Storm Pegasus to Gingka, officially giving it to him. Gingka sadly watches his father reassuring him with a thumb up that everything is OK, while rocks keep falling, eventually forcing Gingka out of the mountain. Outside, he slides down to sit, resting his back against the volcano and he start to cry. As soon as the situation sinks in, he screams \"dad\", having just lost his only other family member. Back in the city, Kenta is crying from hearing this tragedy, and he understands why he hates Ryuga. However, they both agree to try to have fun anyway, but they will definitely try to make Ryuga pay for all he has done soon.",
        "Gingka has a nightmare that he is fighting Ryuga again, but he is still as powerless as before, and he has to watch as his Storm Pegasus gets completely annihilated by Lightning L-Drago. He wakes up with a start, hand extended towards the window through which the sun is shining, as if to reach desperately for the remains of Pegasus. After a few seconds, he calms down and stares at the table beside him; he grabs Pegasus and lays back down on the couch to try to sleep some more. In the morning, Madoka, Kenta and Benkei notice that Gingka has not even touched the triple-beef burger and fries that were prepared for him. Together, they recall the latest events and reckon that Gingka is not the same anymore: he does not seem half as lively as he used to be. Unknown to them, Gingka listens to their conversation from the top of the stairs. Finally, he decides to come down and make his presence known by yelling at Benkei not to eat his burger, which he takes back from him. Then, Osamu, Takashi and, Akira enter the B-Pit and Osamu shows his Beyblade to Gingka. He would like to have a match with him because he thinks he stands a better chance now that he slightly improved his blade. With a weary smile, Gingka accepts his challenge. However, as they pronounce the countdown to the match, Gingka has a flash of Ryuga in front of him, instead of seeing Osamu. This vision makes him extremely nervous, which considerably weakens his launch. Osamu easily takes the win; his friends hesitantly congratulate him, almost saying that he is better than Gingka, but they are unable to believe Pegasus' performance. Benkei yells at them before they got to talk further, so they hurry outside. Gingka picks up his Beyblade and acts as if nothing important had happened, but Kenta obviously saw through his fake joy and he tries to get his friend to talk, yet he ends up leaving. Kyoya appears, leaning on a wall; he says Gingka needs time on his own. Kenta decides to follow Gingka to the riverside anyway, and he succeeds in getting him to open up by expressing how he hates seeing Gingka so helpless, and also almost insane, like at the end of his battle against Ryuga. Not too reluctantly, Gingka tells his story: On a beautiful day in his home village named Koma, Gingka wakes up to find that his father is not in the other bed beside his own. He gets up, dresses up, and walks out of the small house to the river nearby; he splashes some water on his face, then walks around the village to find his father. He asks a man who sells fish, as well as some kids who are playing Beyblade if they have seen him. Both their answers lead him to the forest, where he finally meets his father. However, a bear is tackling him and both are more or less wrestling, since Ryo simply smiles at his son, as if there was nothing wrong with the situation. As a matter of fact, he takes his launcher and blade out and destroys the branch that was stuck in the bear's back, and the latter walks away, not threatening at all anymore. Ryo gets back to the village with his son, where they both start Beyblading. Ryo gives Storm Pegasus to Gingka while he uses a random Bey, yet he still wins the game. However, they had fun battling, and Ryo reminds his son that this is all that matters in a match. Later, Gingka's father takes him to the ceremony they have to the Pegasus. At first, all of the villagers are just standing in front of the mountain dedicated to it but, upon their arrival, Ryo launches Storm Pegasus forward and it lights up all the torches atop the pillars that lead to the sanctuary inside the mountain, which is also a volcano. Storm Pegasus finishes its path by going up into the sky and, coincidentally, the Pegasus constellation becomes more visible. Everybody is overwhelmed by all of this. Shortly after though, a helicopter flies past them and lands right outside the entrance to the volcano. Ryo immediately knows that those invaders are dangerous, therefore he runs towards the mountain as well. Inside, Ryuga and Doji avoid all the traps set up against eventual intruders, such as arrows. Just beside the crystal that holds Lightning L-Drago, there is also a trap which could have impaled Ryuga, but he swiftly avoids it by sacrificing his white coat instead. Now in possession of the L-Drago, Ryuga breaks the crystal single-handedly while Ryo appears to attempt to stop them. At first, L-Drago's power seems to be too much for the white-haired BeyBlader to handle, but he soon gets addicted to its immense power. He shoots it onto one of the high rocks that slightly pave the lava underneath them. Lightning L-Drago sculpts the rock to make a Beystadium, and Ryo's Storm Pegasus meets it there. Both start a tough battle during which Ryuga appears to struggle with his new power still, but they quickly embrace each other and he makes a blinding attack that leaves Ryo lying on the ground, too weak to be capable to get back up. Ryo steps onto his rock, bends down, and rips off his Pegasus bandana, which he uses to clean his new Blade. While Ryo tries to stop him from leaving with Lightning L-Drago, Ryuga throws the bandana before him, yet Gingka's father is still unable to even pick it up. As rocks fall from the roof of the volcano, Doji and Ryuga exit with L-Drago, Doji having to support the other Blader with an arm around his shoulder. Gingka, who had been watching the whole battle and who can only stand on his own rock, screams with despair at his father, torn between the urgency of an exit and helping him. Unfortunately, there is no way Ryo could jump to safety, so all he does is send Storm Pegasus to Gingka, officially giving it to him. Gingka sadly watches his father reassuring him with a thumb up that everything is OK, while rocks keep falling, eventually forcing Gingka out of the mountain.

Back in the city, Kenta is crying from hearing this tragedy, and he understands why he hates Ryuga. However, they both agree to try to have fun anyway, but they will definitely try to make Ryuga pay for all he has done soon."

        "After Superboy's near death run-in with Luthor, he is taken to yet another universe, one of which an alternate Dr. Winger, Luthor, who is now a doctor, and Superman exist. Dr. Winger admits that he's responsible for Superboy's latest (and dangerous) adventure. The alternate version of Luthor works to save Superboy who has lost a lot of blood and needs a transfusion to live. Dr. Luthor asks Superman, who is now retired and an old friend, father figure and mentor to him to help. Superman agrees and donates blood. Later, Superman visits Superboy as he recovers and shows him the utopian world that he helped create. Additionally, Superman explains that the reason for the age difference between himself, Superboy and the child found in the alternate universe is that the escape rockets that left Krypton all passed through a timewarp; resulting in different versions of Superman landing at different times in history. Superman also lets slip a few interesting facts about things regarding Superboy's origins and history that Superboy has not discovered yet and to spite being pressed by Superboy for details; Superman won't say anymore. Later, as they tour the city; Superboy expresses his concerns that he won't be able to do the same things in his universe. Superman assures him that he can do it while Superboy confronts the older Superman about feeling bored with life and needing to feel useful. Superboy asks if Superman is happy with his life, given the sacrifices he must have made to help the world. Superman answers that he was proud to be able to help people, but regrets never having children and family. Superboy returns to the other universe and faces Luthor in a brief battle and is slightly injured. In the end, Luthor is taken away and the older Superman arrives to send Superboy back to his universe and take the younger alternate version of himself into his care to be properly nurtured and taught to help others as well as giving the older Superman a new purpose.",

        "Lex Luthor has plans to bring about the end of the world by detonating a network of \"dirty bombs\" that will wipe out the population with a cloud of radiation. And he has a plan to get Superboy out of the way as well. Superboy is drawn to an old lair of Luthor's by a hypersonic signal. There he finds Lana has followed him and they discover a computer program, created by Luthor, known as a \"psycho-disc\". The program allows the user to live out Luthor's life in a virtual reality type environment. Superboy activates the program and becomes Luthor in the VR world. He sees how Luthor lived with an abusive father, and a mother who refused to stand up for herself. The only person Luthor ever loved was his sister Lena. Meanwhile, back in the real world, Lana learns that if Superboy is not removed from the VR world soon, he will be trapped in a never ending loop of Luthor's memories. Lana becomes a part of the program herself, hoping to rescue Superboy. Back at his new lair, Luthor reveals android duplicates of himself and Lena. He says they will live on, even after everyone else on earth is gone. Luthor then activates the countdown on his death bomb.",

After a third encounter at a fire in a nursing home, Superboy begins to search for Cassandra and locates her in a cabin outside the city. She is dying of cancer and has been hearing strange music...the music the ghostly woman plays. She appears once again at Cassandra's cabin and Superboy attempts to stop her, but she is immune to all of his powers. But when Cassandra appears on the front steps of the cabin, in perfect health, it becomes clear that the ghostly woman was leading Superboy to his dying aunt so she could say goodbye.",
