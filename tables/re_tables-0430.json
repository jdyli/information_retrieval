When the results of the nominations were announced Big Brother stated that Anthony, Craig and Kemal were up for eviction. This was Big Brother's second lie. In fact, these three were the only housemates to nominate, so it was everyone else who was subject to the public vote.

When Makosi was told to open the envelope, it simply said \"You Have Been Kidnapped\". One by one the other housemates were called to the diary and offered treats, if they took the treat Makosi would remain in the cage for a further thirty minutes, only Eugene, the last housemate called, refused his treat. Makosi was kidnapped for a total of 3 hours and 15 minutes. On Day 73, housemates were informed that they would be hypnotised, and if they all took part successfully they would receive a reward. One by one they were called to the diary room and given the information that this was fake, they were each given a secret mission, given a trigger word, and when it is said in the house they should convince the other housemates they are hypnotised to behave a certain way, for example, Anthony was given the trigger word \"hotstuff\" and told to pretend he was in a nightclub chatting up fellow housemates. All the housemates received the same secret mission, and passed to receive a reward of cocktails and ice cream. On Day 74, housemates were given the task to perform The Big Brother Play, where they would re-enact memorable moments playing past and present housemates, and they chose the genre of \"arguments\" to perform. They were successful and won an \"after show\" party with non-alcoholic drinks. On Day 75, housemates were given a cheerleading task, where in costume they had to perform a cheerleading routine. They were successful and received a takeaway as a reward. About one hour after Craig was evicted, Big Brother called a housemate to the Diary Room and Eugene was first to respond. He sat down behind a suitcase containing \u00a350,000 in cash - half the winner's prize money. Big Brother told him he had the option of winning half this money, leaving the other half for the winner. Big Brother told the remaining housemates that if he turned down the money, the prize money would double to \u00a3200,000. Eugene was given one minute to make to his decision while he was watched on screen by the rest of the housemates. After about 50 seconds, Eugene made his decision and chose to take the \u00a350,000."

On Day 78, the final, Kinga received the least number of public votes (4.1% of the four-way total) and came in 4th place. Makosi came third with 8.7% of the three-way vote. Eugene was next to leave, coming second with 42.7% of the final two-way vote. With 57.3% of the two-way vote, Anthony was the winner of Big Brother 2005."
