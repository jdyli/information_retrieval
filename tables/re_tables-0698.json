Jess repeatedly calls Rory and keeps hanging up. Rory breaks up with Jess for good. Lorelai tells Luke not to get engaged.",
        "In the third season finale, Rory's graduation day from Chilton has arrived. With the Independence Inn set to close, a newly unemployed Lorelai plans to use her inn-buying funds to pay for Yale, until Rory goes behind her back to make a new deal with her grandparents and reinstates Friday night dinners. Lorelai and Sookie buy the Dragonfly Inn. The Gilmore Girls get ready for their European adventure, and Luke decides to go on a cruise with Nicole prompted by a conversation with Lorelai. Jess repeatedly calls Rory and keeps hanging up. Rory breaks up with Jess for good. Lorelai tells Luke not to get engaged."
