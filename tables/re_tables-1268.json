Quinn is married with four children and acknowledges she was a \"stuck up little nightmare\" in high school. Daria, appearing somewhat less rebellious with smaller glasses, more stylized hair and slightly more feminine clothing, is an award winning Op-Ed columnist and married to a college professor. The four of them sit down together and enjoy a pleasant game of cards, appearing very much the happy family. Daria shows the story to Helen, who reads it and begins to cry."

A friend of Julie touches the dome and goes into labor so Julie takes her to the hospital. But on their way, they are gas-jacked by the two Dundee brothers that killed Rose, but Barbie arrives and the two flee. Barbie then takes the woman in labor to Alice to help them. While that's happening, Junior and Big Jim argue about Junior disturbing Angie and Jim forces Junior out of his house. Angie then decides to go see Rose and runs into Joe's friend and both fix the diner. Junior goes to the police station and comes with Linda to find the two murderers. Junior realizes that they are at an abandoned house and gets told by Linda that one of them almost raped Angie. Linda kills one of the brothers during a fight. Junior kills the other for the attempted murder when he tries to escape. Elsewhere, Ollie threatens Big Jim. Big Jim then checks on the city's stockpiled propane, however, he is stopped by an armed thug.

The next morning, Big Jim confronts Ollie and gets Barbie, Linda, Junior and Carter to take the well from Ollie. But about 10 guys with guns appear and Carter is shot. Junior betrays his father and joins Ollie's side. As Jim is rounding up volunteers to attack Ollie's farm, Barbie and Linda plan to blow up the well so that the other well's water returns. Barbie then tries to get Big Jim's approval but he denies it. Meanwhile, Norrie blames Joe for her mother's death and breaks up with him. Joe then tells Julia about the mini-dome and the egg and both go to see it. But this time the egg is pink and when Julia touches the dome, she sees another Joe who says, \"The monarch will be crowned.\" Joe then thinks that something bad will happen to him. Junior finds out that his mother did not die because of an accidental car crash but as a suicide by Ollie. Junior then asks Ollie not to kill Jim because he wants to. Before Big Jim and the volunteers attack, Barbie infiltrates Ollie's farm and creates a homemade bomb and sticks it to the well. At night, Big Jim, Linda, Phil, and the rest attack the farm. Jim then realizes that Barbie is going to go ahead with bombing Ollie's well. In the ensuing battle, Phil and some other people are shot and killed except for Phil who received a gunshot wound to his shoulder. Right before Barbie detonates the bomb, he is caught but escapes and destroys the well. While everyone realizes that the well has been destroyed, Junior appears and knocks Jim out with his gun. As Joe and Julia are exiting the forest and into the street, Linda almost hits Joe while she drives Phil to the hospital. Linda then reassures Joe that he will be fine. Angie and Norrie bond and she talks Norrie into getting back together with Joe. Norrie then tells Joe that she is ready to bury Alice. Big Jim is dragged into Ollie's living room and Ollie's men leave saying that they no longer need his water. Ollie then gives permission for Junior to kill Big Jim but instead, Junior asks Jim questions about his mother. When Junior starts to get soft, Ollie pulls out a gun and aims it at Jim but Junior shoots and kills Ollie. Big Jim and Junior then reconcile before parting ways. Big Jim is confronted by Barbie. At the police station, Linda is surprised to see Junior back and he tells her what happened. He says that he no longer has a home, and that he will now live in the cell. At Julia's house, Julia asks Barbie if he knows what the other Joe meant but he says no. It is then hinted that Angie may also be connected to the dome as evidenced by the camera panning across her shoulder blade to show a tattoo of a butterfly.",

At Julia's house, Julia asks Barbie if he knows what the other Joe meant but he says no. It is then hinted that Angie may also be connected to the dome as evidenced by the camera panning across her shoulder blade to show a tattoo of a butterfly.",
        "At night, Junior comes home but Big Jim points a gun at him and tells him to leave. The next morning, Big Jim confronts Ollie and gets Barbie, Linda, Junior and Carter to take the well from Ollie. But about 10 guys with guns appear and Carter is shot. Junior betrays his father and joins Ollie's side. As Jim is rounding up volunteers to attack Ollie's farm, Barbie and Linda plan to blow up the well so that the other well's water returns. Barbie then tries to get Big Jim's approval but he denies it. Meanwhile, Norrie blames Joe for her mother's death and breaks up with him. Joe then tells Julia about the mini-dome and the egg and both go to see it. But this time the egg is pink and when Julia touches the dome, she sees another Joe who says, \"The monarch will be crowned.\" Joe then thinks that something bad will happen to him. Junior finds out that his mother did not die because of an accidental car crash but as a suicide by Ollie. Junior then asks Ollie not to kill Jim because he wants to. Before Big Jim and the volunteers attack, Barbie infiltrates Ollie's farm and creates a homemade bomb and sticks it to the well. At night, Big Jim, Linda, Phil, and the rest attack the farm. Jim then realizes that Barbie is going to go ahead with bombing Ollie's well. In the ensuing battle, Phil and some other people are shot and killed except for Phil who received a gunshot wound to his shoulder. Right before Barbie detonates the bomb, he is caught but escapes and destroys the well. While everyone realizes that the well has been destroyed, Junior appears and knocks Jim out with his gun. As Joe and Julia are exiting the forest and into the street, Linda almost hits Joe while she drives Phil to the hospital. Linda then reassures Joe that he will be fine. Angie and Norrie bond and she talks Norrie into getting back together with Joe. Norrie then tells Joe that she is ready to bury Alice. Big Jim is dragged into Ollie's living room and Ollie's men leave saying that they no longer need his water. Ollie then gives permission for Junior to kill Big Jim but instead, Junior asks Jim questions about his mother.

        "Linda takes Julia to help investigate Duke's involvement with previous criminal activity in Chester's Mill. During their investigation, Linda finds a note from Duke saying that after his son died from a drug addiction, he vowed to get drugs out of the town by making a deal with Maxine; he and others bought the propane she needed, and she would keep drugs out of the town; Reverend Lester then laundered the proceeds and Big Jim bought the propane. Julia then finds out that her husband Peter filed a five-year life insurance policy on himself. She later finds out that Barbie killed him, but she interprets it as Peter wanting to die due to his overwhelming debt. Maxine proves to Barbie that she intends on taking over the town after she shows him an underground black market fight club. She then blackmails Barbie into fighting Victor, an old rival of his. He begins to win, but then throws the match, something Maxine expected him to do. Later, Maxine tries to seduce Barbie and threaten to reveal his secrets, but Barbie leaves saying that he is done with her. Big Jim finds a house on a nearby island that Maxine is supposedly hiding at, and finds the house's caretaker Agatha. Jim begins to look through the house, with Agatha eventually pulling a gun and revealing she is Maxine's mother, having given birth to her at age 16 and dropping out of high school. She then tells Jim that she knows as much as Maxine does about the town, especially about his and Barbie's secrets. Big Jim then intimidates her, saying that she doesn't have the courage to kill. He then grabs the gun from her and takes her to his boat. While on the boat, Agatha falls into the water, and cannot swim as her hands are tied up. She pleads for Jim to pull her up, but he leaves her to drown. That night, he heads home to find Linda waiting for him, telling him to meet her at the police station the next day for questioning. Joe, Angie, and Norrie touch the mini-dome in their barn simultaneously with the egg in the middle beginning to glow. The dome then reveals a fourth handprint, implying that a fourth hand is required to touch the dome. The three promise not to tell anyone as they search for the fourth person. Dodee then sneaks into the barn and touches the mini-dome. She is then shocked and knocked out. The three kids then take her to the hospital and tell her that she electrocuted herself while fixing her generator. Angie then asks Nurse Adams if any people have recently had seizures, and she replies saying not since her Grade 10 dance. Angie later tells Joe and Norrie that Junior had a seizure during that dance. She then tells them that she was kidnapped by Junior. Joe vows to get revenge on Junior, but not before Angie takes the two to Junior's house to show them a painting Junior's mother made of a dream she had, depicting Junior and \"pink stars falling in lines.\" Junior then finds them in the basement, and Joe runs toward him, but is put in a choke hold. Angie demands Junior let Joe go, and he does. The three then take Junior to the barn as the \"fourth hand.\" After the four of them touch the dome, the egg in the middle releases pink stars all over the barn walls.

Joe, Norrie, Angie, and Junior release their grip from the mini-dome and see white spots all over the barn, which are supposed to link up the constellations that they created. Later, Junior tries again to seduce Angie, with her replying that a relationship will never happen. Junior then decides to leave the three kids and forget about the mini-dome. As this happens, funnel clouds begin to appear in the sky. Junior then heads home and finds his father Big Jim, who arms him with a gun and bullets saying to stay at the house and beware of Maxine, who is threatening to hurt those closest to him. Angie then heads to the house pleading for Junior to return and help her, Joe, and Norrie with a situation with the mini-dome. As the funnel cloud grows, the wind picks up a bench, which almost hits Angie, but is saved by Junior. The clouds then begin to subside. Junior and Angie then realize that the dome wants him to stick with the three kids. Julia is shot by Maxine after Barbie rejected her in the previous episode. Barbie then gets Joe to drive them to the hospital. When they got there and see that the nurses are busy with other tornado-related emergencies, Barbie is forced to heal Julia's wounds. While feeding oxygen into her through a small tube, her heart stops. As this happens, a branch flies through the window, with Barbie pushing Joe out of the way. The clouds then subside, and Julia's heart begins to beat again. Joe then concludes that Barbie is the \"monarch [that] will be crowned.\" Later, Barbie gets Big Jim's help to take down Maxine without any death on their part. The two head to Maxine's underground club, but are ambushed by Maxine and a gunman. She says how she wants revenge for the murder of her mother Agatha, and that she wants to live a life with Barbie, but he rejects her advances. The power then goes out from Barbie's activated alarm which cut the power. Barbie and Big Jim then steal their guns and lead them outside. Barbie then leaves, telling Maxine \"You're done.\" As he walks off, Big Jim kills both Maxine and the gunman. Big Jim then tries to shoot Barbie, but he punches him in the throat and steals the gun. Linda then appears and Big Jim lies, saying that Barbie killed the two. Throughout the episode, Linda has been finding false evidence that concludes that Barbie is a dangerous felon. Barbie runs off before anything can happen to him. Big Jim later heads to the radio station and finds Dodee, who during the storm managed to gain access to a message from the military, saying that they have found Barbie. Big Jim hears this message, and then goes on the radio, framing Barbie for numerous crimes that occurred over the past few days. Norrie convinces Joe, Angie and Junior to touch the bigger dome at the same time. Upon doing so, the four see a vision of Big Jim bleeding from three stab wounds and a bloody nose. The vision then has the four holding four bloody knives, with Junior running off to find his dad. The three others then consider that in order for the dome to come down, they have to kill Big Jim.",

        "The monarch hatches, and the butterfly starts flying around inside the mini dome violently and creating expanding black spots where it crashes against the surface. These spots are mirrored in the big dome and begin to expand until both domes are jet black, casting the town into permanent darkness. Joe suggests the four touch the dome, but Linda cuts in, stating the egg is police property, the four choose not to stop her, knowing she will be knocked unconscious allowing them to escape. Junior, Angie, Joe, and Norrie then touch the dome together, the mini dome shatters releasing the both the Egg and butterfly, and at first it seems to hover round their prime candidate for Monarch, Barbie, but finally, they discover that the Monarch is Julia. They receive a visit from one of the dome's people who looks like Alice. The visitor states that they have taken human form to \"bridge the divide\", and that the reason for the dome is \"to protect them\". When they ask from what, the reply is \"you will see, in time\". They also discover that they must earn the light by keeping the egg safe. Barbie then gets captured by Junior. Big Jim thinks that his family are the chosen ones because his mentally ill wife had been painting pink stars and eggs in her last days before suicide, indicating she had some knowledge of things to come. When Junior confronts him, he admits that he has actually killed the ones he accused Barbie of, but just to save the town. They put Barbie in a noose and then Julia has to choose to save the egg and the lives of the entire town, or save Barbie by giving the egg to Big Jim within one hour. She accepts the responsibility of the title Monarch and chooses the egg (and the lives of everybody in the dome) and protects it by throwing it in the lake. The egg starts to glow, and the pink stars rise to the sky. Big Jim says the Lord is blessing the hanging, the stars continue to rise and remove the dark black \"curtain\", replacing it with a curtain of piercing bright white light, increasing in intensity until things start to fade to white. Junior seeks guidance from his dad, and Big Jim continues to tell Junior to pull the lever, as the camera focuses on Barbie's face, the episode and season ends.",

In the end Daria and Tom break up, Jane and Daria end up going to colleges near each other, Kevin tells Brittany and they stay together (though it is implied their break-up is imminent), Barch and O'Neil stay together (much to DeMartino's annoyance) but don't get married and Mac talks Jodie's parents into letting her choose her own college. During the graduation ceremony, Daria receives an award for academic excellence and gives a speech where she tells the crowd that high school sucks and that you are lucky if you can survive but also highlights that surviving is easier if you have good friends, nodding to Jane, and a supporting family, nodding to her parents and Quinn.",

        "When Daria helps her classmate Brittany Taylor with an assignment in art class, Brittany thanks her by inviting her \u2013 \"just this once\" \u2013 to her upcoming Saturday night party. (Of course, it's a back-handed compliment, as Daria was only invited because Brittany promised \"not to invite any more really attractive girls.\") Daria doesn't want to go, but is eventually persuaded by two people: Jane, who sees it as an opportunity to get some really great sketches; and Quinn, who's deathly afraid that Daria will do something to embarrass her (which, naturally, proves to be the biggest incentive of all). After turning down Helen and Jake's offer to drive them to the party, Quinn gets a ride with Joey, Jeffy, and Jamie\u2014three members of the football team who have become Quinn's biggest admirers (slaves to her every whim) \u2013 while Daria and Jane get a ride with Jane's musician brother, Trent, on whom the normally stoic Daria appears to have more than a passing interest. Unfortunately, Jane only has a brief opportunity to kid her about it before arriving at the gate house for Crewe Neck, the gated community where Brittany lives. Daria's on the guest list, but Jane is not; however, they're able to slip past the guard when Jane distracts him with some of her \"life drawing\" sketches. The party itself is your typical teenage bash: music, munchies, and making out in the laundry room. While Daria and Jane are given a tour of the house by an obnoxious flirt \"Upchuck\" (who only got invited because he dissected Brittany's frog in science class), Quinn is waited on hand and foot by Joey, Jeffy, and Jamie, but immediately goes into hiding once she sees Daria and Jane arrive. Daria, however, is not about to let her off the hook that easily; besides, she figures, torturing Quinn is the only fun she's likely to have at the party. Quinn finally bribes Daria to leave her alone when she starts telling embarrassing stories to Joey, Jeffy, and Jamie (also promising them photos of Quinn in a chubby stage). Satisfied, Daria tracks down Jane (who had slipped off to the make-out room with a boy she had met) and both leave the party, just one step ahead of both party crashers and the cops (who were called by a neighbor upset about the noise). As the party ends, Upchuck drives up and gives Daria, Jane, and Quinn (who was left rideless when Joey, Jeffy, and Jamie beat each other up) a ride home. First appearances: Joey, Jeffy and Jamie, three sycophantic Quinn admirers who follow her every command; Jodie Landon, Lawndale High's model student and her boyfriend, Lanwdale High football squad's captain, Michael \"Mack\" MacKenzie who strongly dislikes Kevin who deemed him the nickname \"Mack Daddy\" \u2013 both Jodie and Mack make Lawndale High's couple of African American sweethearts; Claire Defoe, Lawndale High's down-to-earth art teacher; Charles \"Upchuck\" Ruttheimer III, an obnoxious flirt who attempts to turn on both Daria and Jane but fails; Tiffany Blum-Deckler, the Fashion Club's third member Guest appearances: Crewe Neck Gatehouse guard, who attempts to track down Jane so she can teach him life drawing; Brittany's neighbor, an angry man who complains about the volume of her party; Crewe Neck residents, Brittany's other neighbors who are harassed and competed in trivia by Daria and Jane who play \"rent-a-cop\" at the gatehouse while the guard is absent \u2013 including a snotty elderly woman and a man who plays \"Name That Tune\" with Daria and Jane",

        "During a visit with their old friends, Doug and Susan, Helen and Jake become concerned about Daria and Quinn's chances of getting into good colleges, so they insist that the girls take a college prep class at Lawndale High. One of the requirements of this (rather lame) class is to visit a college, and Jake and Helen naturally pick their alma mater, Middleton College. When they arrive, they're greeted by a tour guide named Heather, and they just barely have time to start the tour when Jake is distracted by a water balloon thrown from his old dorm window. Swept up in a wave of nostalgia, Jake takes Helen to visit his old hangout, leaving Daria and Quinn with the tour guide. The tour doesn't last much longer, as Quinn decides to investigate the fraternity/sorority scene on her own. Daria and Heather then retreat to Heather's dorm room, where Daria gets a much more realistic view of college life: sitting around and watching television, working a stupid part-time job, begging your parents for money, and helping the college students with their term papers (for cash, of course). Meanwhile, Jake gets a little too into the college scene as he tries (with no success) to act cool and \"hang\" with the college guys, while Helen reminisces about college life... and tears off after the girls (Quinn, specifically) when she remembers how college guys acted around women. They find Quinn at a frat house, where she had been made \"keg queen\" and was busy wrapping the guys around her little finger; eventually, the whole family is tossed off the campus when security finds out that the two underage girls were wandering around the campus unsupervised (even though Daria had stayed with Heather the tour guide the whole time). Back at home, Quinn receives a letter of acceptance to Manatee College in Florida, which makes Helen and Jake ecstatic... until they read the fine print, and discover that Manatee has no classes, just beachfront accommodations and costs $10,000 per semester. Furthermore, Daria decides to quit doing the college students' term papers, as it was getting to be too much work (not to mention the tiny little detail about Helen not letting her keep the money). Daria decides that the whole college experience kinda sucked, but is heartened when Quinn dumps the instructor of the college prep class when she finds out what a \"making-out scholarship\" is really all about. First appearances: None. Guest appearances: Heather, a Middleton College student who first appears perky but later appears cynical and negative, and enjoys hanging out with Daria; Doug and Susan, a couple who are friends with Jake and Helen and have their daughter, Romona, read S.A.T. prep picture books; Romonica, Doug and Susan's three-year-old daughter; the Middleton Bursar who tells Jake how much college enrollment for both Daria and Quinn costs, which leads Jake telling Helen they should decide which one should attend college (Daria, while Jake says Quinn can go to a beauty school); the 'Push Comes to Love' college prep course adviser who attempts to hit on Quinn (which Daria quips as a \"make-out scholarship\"), though Quinn later throws a soda in his face; The characters in the prep course student's (Kevin, Brittany, Quinn, Jane and Daria) college fantasies, which, in Kevin's are intimidating football players which are twice his size and a beautiful blonde woman who joins Kevin in a fit of snickers at Brittany, who is deemed as a \"child\"...in Brittany's there is a singing emcee and several models wearing gowns and graduation caps and bodyguards who carry Kevin away...in Quinn's, three male roommates, one dressed as a preppie, the other as a cowboy and the last one wearing a towel...in Jane's. there is an art critic praising Jane's art...and in Daria's, a professor who wants Daria to be a college teacher herself so he can use her dormroom to carry on affairs with underclassmen",

        "During a visit with their old friends, Doug and Susan, Helen and Jake become concerned about Daria and Quinn's chances of getting into good colleges, so they insist that the girls take a college prep class at Lawndale High. One of the requirements of this (rather lame) class is to visit a college, and Jake and Helen naturally pick their alma mater, Middleton College. When they arrive, they're greeted by a tour guide named Heather, and they just barely have time to start the tour when Jake is distracted by a water balloon thrown from his old dorm window. Swept up in a wave of nostalgia, Jake takes Helen to visit his old hangout, leaving Daria and Quinn with the tour guide. The tour doesn't last much longer, as Quinn decides to investigate the fraternity/sorority scene on her own. Daria and Heather then retreat to Heather's dorm room, where Daria gets a much more realistic view of college life: sitting around and watching television, working a stupid part-time job, begging your parents for money, and helping the college students with their term papers (for cash, of course). Meanwhile, Jake gets a little too into the college scene as he tries (with no success) to act cool and \"hang\" with the college guys, while Helen reminisces about college life... and tears off after the girls (Quinn, specifically) when she remembers how college guys acted around women. They find Quinn at a frat house, where she had been made \"keg queen\" and was busy wrapping the guys around her little finger; eventually, the whole family is tossed off the campus when security finds out that the two underage girls were wandering around the campus unsupervised (even though Daria had stayed with Heather the tour guide the whole time). Back at home, Quinn receives a letter of acceptance to Manatee College in Florida, which makes Helen and Jake ecstatic... until they read the fine print, and discover that Manatee has no classes, just beachfront accommodations and costs $10,000 per semester. Furthermore, Daria decides to quit doing the college students' term papers, as it was getting to be too much work (not to mention the tiny little detail about Helen not letting her keep the money). Daria decides that the whole college experience kinda sucked, but is heartened when Quinn dumps the instructor of the college prep class when she finds out what a \"making-out scholarship\" is really all about.
